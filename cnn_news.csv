2,Images from Gaza show Israeli soldiers detaining dozens of men stripped to underwear,"Jerusalem CNN —

Images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday showed a mass detention by the Israeli military of men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds, and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle.

The exact circumstances and dates of the detentions are unclear, but some of the detainees’ identities were confirmed by colleagues or family members.

Both the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hamas responded Friday to the images.

IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus told CNN the men pictured were “Hamas members and suspect Hamas members.” He said they were “without clothes in order to make sure they’re not carrying explosives.”

Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas’ political office, accused Israel in a statement of “kidnapping, invasive searches and disrobing” what he said was “a group of displaced Palestinian civilians.” He called it a “reprehensible crime” and urged human rights organizations to intervene.

At least some of the men are civilians with no known affiliation to militant groups, according to a CNN interview with one of their relatives and a statement by one of their employers, a news network.

The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor posted an image of one detainment and said in a statement on its website Thursday that “the Israeli army detained and severely abused dozens of Palestinian civilians.”

“Euro-Med Monitor received reports that Israeli forces launched random and arbitrary arrest campaigns against displaced people, including doctors, academics, journalists, and elderly men,” it said.

CNN has geo-located some of the images to Beit Lahia, north of Gaza City.

The Israeli media, without indicating a source, has portrayed the images as the surrender of Hamas members. A journalist asked IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari about the images during a news conference on Thursday, saying, “We’ve seen images of many captives, Hamas terrorists, that the IDF arrested during the ground maneuvering.”

Hagari said that, in fighting Hamas, “those left in the area gradually come out.”

“We investigate and check who has ties to Hamas, and who does not,” he said. “We arrest them all and question them. We will continue dismantling each one of those strongholds until we are done.”

On Friday, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy told CNN that men depicted in images of mass detentions in Gaza were all “suspected terrorists.”

Israeli forces were apprehending military-age men in areas of Gaza where they had been urging evacuation for more than a month, according to Levy, describing these areas as “Hamas strongholds.” Those who were not terrorists would be released, he said.

In an interview with CNN on Friday, Hani Almadhoun, director of philanthropy for the US arm of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA USA) said he knew a dozen people pictured in circulating images, including his brother.

“They’re neither fighters, they’re not surrendering, they’re just civilians who were there with their families trying to survive this,” Almadhoun told CNN’s Pamela Brown.

Almadhoun said the men he knew from his family had since been released, but described the situation as “baffling” to see his brother, a father and a shopkeeper, “dragged” from his home as a suspected Hamas combatant.

“My brother has seizures and they had him naked in the street and they put him on the beach in the winter, naked taking pictures of him, verifying who he is, and then they released him after they roughed him up a little bit,” he said.

“There is a lot of trauma from this for anybody who is watching, especially for my mom who has lost her son,” he said after describing how another brother and his family had recently been killed in an air strike. “You don’t recover from this. This is not just about justice, this feels like more about revenge.”

His family remained in northern Gaza instead of evacuating because they had nowhere to go in the south and had a family member killed in a safe zone, he added.

In a statement Thursday, news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed said that one of its correspondents and several members of his family were among those detained as part of the incident portrayed in the images.

It reported that Diaa Al-Kahlout was arrested by Israeli troops at gunpoint and forced to leave his disabled daughter behind, before he was allegedly stripped and beaten.

“Today, Thursday, the Israeli occupation army arrested the journalist and the director of ‘The New Arab’ office in Gaza, our colleague Diaa Al-Kahlot, from Market Street in Beit Lahia, along with a group of his brothers, relatives, and other civilians,” Al-Araby Al-Jadeed wrote.

“The occupation deliberately forced Gazans to take off their clothes, searched them, and humiliated them when they were arrested before taking them to an unknown destination, according to what the people there told us. Pictures and video clips spread showing soldiers arresting dozens of Gazans using criminal and humiliating method.”

Hussam Kanafani, the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed editor-in-chief, said in the statement that Al-Kahlot and his family were still missing.

“We will make every effort possible, in cooperation with international institutions and organizations concerned with the rights and freedom of journalists in the world, to determine the whereabouts of our colleague Diaa and release him as soon as possible,” Kanafani said.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was concerned by reports of Al-Kahlout’s arrest and called for his release.

“The Israeli army should disclose his location, release him immediately, and take steps to ensure the safety of all journalists covering this war, especially those in Gaza who face imminent harm,” CPJ Middle East and North Africa Program Coordinator Sherif Mansour said in a statement.

3,"Vladimir Putin, Russian president, says he will seek re-election in 2024","CNN —

Vladimir Putin says he will run for president again in Russia’s elections in March 2024, in a move that could see him retain power until at least 2030.

Putin made the announcement Friday after a ceremony at the Kremlin, the official residence of the Russian president.

Putin will bid for his fifth presidential term at the elections, set to take place on March 17, 2024, as he aims to solidify his continuous hold on power as head of state or prime minister for more than two decades.

The upcoming elections will also mark the first time that residents of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, annexed by Russia during the conflict, will participate in the presidential elections.

Russia’s Central Election Commission said it would organize “house-to-house voting” in those four regions over three consecutive days on March 15, 16 and 17.

The international community previously condemned local elections in these regions, organized by Russian-backed officials, as a sham.

Putin became acting prime minister of Russia in August 1999, before unexpectedly being handed the presidency by then-President Boris Yeltsin on New Year’s Eve of that year.

He served two four-year terms as president before stepping aside in 2008, as he was not constitutionally permitted to run for another presidential term. He endorsed Dmitry Medvedev, who replaced him as president, while Putin took the role of prime minister for a second time.

But he regained the presidency in 2012 and has not relinquished his grip on power since. After winning re-election in 2018, Putin then signed a law in 2021 which paved the way for him to run for two more six-year terms.

The changes to the law means that Putin, 71, could potentially extend his rule until 2036, by which time he will be in his mid-80s and his rule will be well into its third decade.

Putin is expected to face no more than token opposition in March. Under his authoritarian rule, opposition politicians have met similar fates: Exile, imprisonment or death in suspicious circumstances.

Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who posed one of the most serious political challenges to Putin during his rule, was sentenced in August to 19 years in prison on extremism charges. Navalny and his supporters claim his arrest was politically motivated, intended to silence his criticism of Putin.

Navalny was immediately detained upon returning to Russia in 2021. He had been taken from Russian to Germany in 2020, after he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok. Navalny arrived comatose at a hospital in Berlin, following a medical evacuation flight from the Siberian city of Omsk. A joint investigation by CNN and the group Bellingcat implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in Navalny’s poisoning.

Russia denies involvement in Navalny’s poisoning. Putin said in December 2020 that if Russian security services had wanted to kill Navalny, they “would have finished” the job.

Putin’s war in Ukraine, initially expected by Russia to last just a few weeks, will likely have entered its second year by the time presidential elections are held in March. While accurately gauging public opinion in Russia is difficult, the war is still thought to command broad support among the public, despite the costs it has placed on Russian society.

The Kremlin tries to keep the Russian population isolated from the worst of the conflict, but Ukraine has repeatedly attempted to bring the war home to Russia, launching its own strikes on cities across the country – including on the Kremlin itself.

Russia has kept the casualty numbers from its war in Ukraine shrouded in secrecy. In September 2022, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said 5,937 troops had been killed in the war. The ministry has not published an update since.

But western intelligence assessments put the toll much higher. Western intelligence assessments put the toll much higher. The United Kingdom defense ministry said in October it is likely that Russia has suffered between 150,000 and 190,000 permanent casualties, meaning killed or permanently wounded, since February 2022.

Earlier this month, Russia announced it would increase its number of troops by 170,000, continuing to draw on its population as its invasion of Ukraine enters its 22nd month.","['russian', 'ukraine', 'elections', 'seek', 'reelection', 'putin', 'presidential', 'war', 'president', '2024', 'rule', 'vladimir', 'navalny', 'russia']","CNN —Vladimir Putin says he will run for president again in Russia’s elections in March 2024, in a move that could see him retain power until at least 2030.

4,Australia swelters under extreme heat as rare early cyclone barrels toward northern coast,"CNN —

A tropical cyclone has rapidly intensified off the northern coast of Australia as millions across the country endure heat wave conditions that are forecast to stretch into the weekend.

Severe tropical cyclone Jasper strengthened to the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane Friday, with maximum winds of 220 kilometers per hour (138 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.



“Further intensification Friday is possible, and a category 5 system cannot be ruled out,” the country’s meteorology bureau said.

Jasper is the earliest Category 4 tropical cyclone to form in the Coral Sea since records began in 1900, according to CNN research of National Hurricane Center storm tracks.

The storm, which is located 1,195 kilometers (742 miles) northeast of Queensland and moving south at 9 kph (6 mph), could strike the coast near Cairns, a city of 250,000 people, with maximum sustained winds of 140 kph (87 mph) by early Tuesday.

However, forecasters say its projected path could change.

The storm’s arrival is unusually early during El Niño, a climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and generally reduces rainfall along Australia’s east coast.

The system has impacted weather all over the world this year and can particularly influence storm seasons.

Meanwhile, heat warnings are in effect in several states and territories, including New South Wales, home to more than 8 million people.

Temperatures in the NSW capital Sydney are expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) on Saturday, according to Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology, with the heat fueled by strong, dry winds.

Some schools in Sydney were forced to shut Friday and a total fire ban was in place in some parts of NSW, due to the increased risk of bushfires.

A “catastrophic” fire rating was issued in parts of South Australia on Friday, the highest on the scale, which indicates that lives and properties are likely to be lost if a fire starts.

Extreme fire danger ratings were in place in parts of New South Wales and Victoria.

The heat is forecast to weaken somewhat by the end of the weekend into early next week.

Australia is one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of the climate crisis, with frequent heat waves, extreme rainfall and devastating bushfires.

Earlier this year, more than 20 runners in the Sydney Marathon were hospitalized in a heat wave during Australia’s warmest winter since records began in 1910.

Ski resorts, including Perisher, the country’s largest, also closed early due to a lack of snow.

Fears were particularly high as memories of the catastrophic 2020 Black Summer fires – the country’s worst in decades – remain etched in the minds of millions of Australians.

The fires burned 10 million hectares (24.7 million acres), killing dozens of people and destroying more than 3,000 homes.","['storm', 'heat', 'rare', 'barrels', 'early', 'northern', 'cyclone', 'australia', 'sydney', 'mph', 'swelters', 'million', 'extreme', 'coast', 'south', 'parts', 'tropical']","CNN —A tropical cyclone has rapidly intensified off the northern coast of Australia as millions across the country endure heat wave conditions that are forecast to stretch into the weekend.

5,Italy quits Belt and Road plan as Europe rethinks China relations,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

Italy, the only G7 country to join China’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative, will leave the global infrastructure program when its contract expires next year - the latest sign of hardening European attitudes to Beijing and its global ambitions.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Thursday confirmed the widely expected move, a campaign pledge during her run for office last year amid complaints the deal signed with China by a previous government in 2019 had brought few benefits to Italy’s economy.

Meloni stressed however that Rome could maintain good ties with Beijing outside the program, which has expanded China’s global influence while raising concerns it has saddled some countries with unmanageable debt.

“I think that we should … improve our cooperation with China on trade, the economy,” Meloni told reporters, according to Reuters, in her first public comments on the issue after reports Italy had told China of its decision not to extend the pact after it expires in March 2024.

“The tool of the (BRI) … has not produced the results that were expected,” she added.

Italy’s move comes as the European Union has embarked on a campaign to “de-risk” its supply chains from China’s and secure sensitive technologies after the bloc deemed Beijing a “systemic rival” in 2019.

Those frictions were on show Thursday during a summit between EU heads and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing, where the two sides grappled with points of contention from trade to Russia’s war in Ukraine - with little concrete progress made.

China’s Foreign Ministry took a measured tone when asked about the Italian withdrawal during a regular press briefing Thursday, pointing to the “enormous appeal and global influence of Belt and Road cooperation.”

“China firmly opposes attempts to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation or stoke bloc confrontation and division,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, without referring directly to Italy.

‘Wicked’ decision

China has inked agreements with what it says are more than 140 countries for partnership on the program, which has funneled hundreds of billions of dollars into roads, ports, airports and bridges, largely across the Global South over the past decade.

Italy’s decision to join the scheme in 2019 was widely seen at the time as a diplomatic win for Beijing – and drew criticism from Washington and Brussels.

In an interview with newspaper Corriere della Sera this summer, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto branded the 2019 decision as “wicked,” citing growing trade imbalances between the two countries.

China imported $26.9 billion in Italian goods last year, compared with $21.4 billion in 2019. By contrast, Chinese exports to Italy rose to $50.5 billion from $33.5 billion over the same period, according to China’s customs data.

Rome joined the scheme under former China-friendly Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who condemned the withdrawal in an interview posted to his Facebook page, saying it was made for “ideological reasons” and risked “scuppering” potential expansion of Italian exports.

Chinese Ambassador to Italy Jia Guide earlier this year in an interview with Italian news outlet Fanpage suggested a “reckless” decision to withdraw from the pact would have a “negative” impact on cooperation.

Italian leaders have appeared keen to navigate the withdrawal carefully, with Meloni repeatedly suggesting it was possible to have good relations with China outside the Belt and Road plan. She has also previously denied speculation that the United States pressured her to quit the scheme.

EU meeting in Beijing

The news of Rome’s withdrawal came as the delegation of top European Union officials arrived in Beijing for the first in-person EU-China summit in four years.

The meeting was seen by Chinese leaders as a key opportunity to smooth contentious relations with Europe, which Beijing continues to see as a key potential counterweight in its competition with the United States.

“We should not view each other as rivals just because our systems are different, reduce cooperation because competition exists, or engage in confrontation because there are disagreements,” Xi told the visiting leaders, according to China’s official readout.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel pressed Xi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang on the gaping trade deficit between their economies and “unfair competition,” while Li urged the EU to be “prudent” in its use of “restrictive” economic policies.

Though the summit appeared to do little to resolve key issues, Von der Leyen said it saw both sides agree “that it is in our joint interest to have balanced trade relations.”

The EU side would be looking for “concrete progress following these discussions,” the bloc said in a statement after the meeting.","['chinas', 'belt', 'italian', 'europe', 'relations', 'road', 'european', 'italy', 'trade', 'china', 'withdrawal', 'global', 'beijing', 'plan', 'quits', 'rethinks']","Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

6,Women say their farms were seized to build nickel mines amid Indonesia's electric vehicle boom,"This story is part of As Equals , CNN's ongoing series on gender inequality. For information about how the series is funded and more, check out our FAQs

(CNN) Masita rustles through the long grass, trying not to stumble as she points to another mountain in the distance. ""That all there used to be my land,"" she said. ""All gone.""

The mountain on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was once covered in thousands of pepper trees planted by her family, but all that's left is exposed red soil.

The 54-year-old said she didn't know her family was about to lose their livelihood -- her daughter phoned her at the market where she used to sell their harvest and said the trees had been destroyed.

""I climbed up to the hill and together my neighbors and I tried to stop the heavy equipment,"" recalled Masita, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name. When she tried to climb onto the machinery, she said the men tried to stop her and called the police.

She said she kept shouting, ""How could you, why did you do this to us, how can we live, how will we feed our families, should we eat stones?""

Masita, a former pepper farmer, looks over the land her family cultivated before it became a nickel mine.

Masita, along with her entire village in East Luwu regency, was evicted from the lands they were farming in 2015 so that a company could build a nickel mine, she said.

Like Masita, many Indonesian farmers do not have any clear land titles -- leading to land disputes and conflicts over territory. It's a problem made even more complicated by the fact that some regions on the national mapping appear uninhabited even if the land has been cultivated for generations.

Land in East Luwu was seized as part of Indonesia's push to become a world leader in the surging market for nickel, a crucial element long used in stainless steel. Extra demand has been created by the global push away from planet-heating fossil fuels toward renewable energy. Nickel is also used in lithium-ion batteries found in everyday objects like electric toothbrushes, laptop computers and cellphones. But those batteries are increasingly being used to power electric vehicles (EVs) and e-bikes.

The government's rush to expand its nickel processing and EV market has come at a cost to women like Masita who rely on pepper farms as their only source of income. Farming is one of the few industries available to women for jobs and economic opportunity.

Masita said she received a one-time payment from the mining company of around $50 million Indonesian rupiah (around $3,223) in exchange for the land. With the farm, the widow and mother of four could make up to 6 million rupiah (around $386) in one month from her year-round harvests. Now she's lucky to receive a quarter of that selling cooked food like chicken curry from her small stall in a nearby village.

""If we weren't evicted, we could have still earned millions of rupiahs. We're not rich people, but it's enough to cover our daily living costs,"" she said. ""Today, I borrow money from the bank ... My life has become difficult.""

Masita, a former pepper farmer, now sells meals from a small stall after her land was seized by a nickel mining company.

Indonesia's electric vehicle ambitions

Indonesian President Joko Widodo has mandated the development of the EV industry as a national priority, introducing EV-friendly policies and incentivizing tax breaks aimed at luring foreign investment.

In recent years, he banned the export of raw nickel ore to encourage the development of the country's own nickel processing facilities. Between 2015 and 2022, the value of Indonesia's processed nickel exports surged from $1 billion to an estimated $30 billion, according to Reuters.

Widodo has also mandated the development of Indonesia's own domestic EV industry, aiming to compete against Thailand and India as a viable alternative to China, which hopes to become the world's leading EV maker. With it comes an ambitious goal to produce 600,000 EVs by 2030.

Many of those vehicles are destined for overseas markets as countries aim to meet their national emissions targets by decarbonizing road transport, a sector that accounts for over 15% of global energy-related emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.

However, Indonesia's demand for nickel has meant farms, like Masita's in South Sulawesi, have been seized to support the expansion of nickel mining operations, smelting centers and refineries, as many don't hold formal land titles. Now others fear their farm could be the next to go.

Nurhasiyah, a pepper farmer living in the village of Loeha, also in East Luwu, started growing pepper trees as a young girl and continues to work on the farm with her husband so they can afford to send their three children to school.

""I can't imagine if our plantation were to be taken,"" Nurhasiyah said through tears. ""There would no longer be any livelihood for us.""

Nurhasiya, a farmer in Loeha, picks pepper berries from her plantation in the village of Loeha in East Luwu, Sulawesi.

She said representatives for PT Vale Indonesia, one of Indonesia's largest mining companies and the same company that now owns Masita's land, have started taking soil samples around the village in recent months, telling residents they purchased the land. ""Where is the proof of payment?"" she demanded.

CNN reached out to PT Vale Indonesia and the Indonesian government regarding the claims made by residents of East Luwu regency. It has not received a response from the government.

In an email to CNN, the company did not deny that land had been seized. It said it ""continues to undertake its operations and activities in accordance with its fundamental license to operate (known as its Contract of Work), and with prevailing laws and regulations, including in respect of land usage."" It said it faces ""significant instances of community encroachment by third parties, where land has been cleared for the purposes of community farming and unlawful mining activity"" in South Sulawesi.

In the past, it denied accusations it has seized land from indigenous people. ""PT Vale has never taken rights from other parties without their consent,"" Bayu Aji, PT Vale Indonesia's Head of Communication, told Indonesian magazine Tempo last year, saying it had acquired land in East Luwu through an agreement with the Indonesian government.

A history of controversial land grabs

In Indonesia, it's not unusual for residents to find property they've harvested for generations has been conceded by the government and sold to big businesses for natural resources.

For decades, human rights and environmental groups have accused Indonesia's government of land grabs, turning over rainforests and indigenous people's lands to large companies for the exploitation of resources such as palm oil.

Since assuming office in 2014, Widodo has sought to revitalize Indonesia's economy and support the development of industries reliant on natural resources, while at the same time pledging to slow deforestation and hasten the recognition of land ownership.

Last December, the government said it had recognized around 100 million parcels of land, which had been uncertified in 2015, and acknowledged that there are still 80 million people -- around 29% of the population -- who do not own land certificates.

This is our only source of life: pepper and land. Hasma, founder, ""Women Fighters of Loeha""

But activists say it's not enough and the process to have land recognized is slow and arduous. According to an independent initiative which maps indigenous lands, the Ancestral Domain Registration Agency (BRWA), the government has recognized 3.7 million hectares (9.14 million acres) -- or just 14% -- of land they've mapped claimed by indigenous groups, the environmental news nonprofit Mongabay reported.

In South Sulawesi, Nurhasiyah, along with dozens of other women, have joined the group ""Women Fighters of Loeha,"" fighting for the community's rights to their land.

Hasma, the group's founder, said pepper farming is a source of livelihood for the village's 7,000 residents and provides jobs to hundreds of others who work in the fields. If the farms were to be seized, their lives would be miserable, she said.

""This is our only source of life: pepper and land. If that is taken away, then we will have no other income,"" she said.

Hasma leads a gathering of the ""Women Fighters of Loeha"" to update the group on its efforts to protect their farms.

Women account for nearly a quarter of all farmers in Indonesia, with agriculture employing around 29% of the country's workforce, according to the World Bank. Many juggle the demands of taking care of their homes and children, while also tending to their farms, and are often more impacted than men by environmental changes.

Hasma said her group has sought help from with WALHI, the Indonesian Forum for Living Environment, Indonesia's oldest environmental NGO.

In a statement to the Group of 20 last year, then chaired by Indonesia, WALHI warned leaders to stop promoting electric vehicles as an ""environmentally friendly alternative and solution to the climate crisis.""

The statement called the expansion of nickel mining on Sulawesi ""a catastrophe for the community, especially farmers and women.""

In its joint communique, the G20 recognized the need for ""diversifying energy mixes and systems"" and ensuring ""clean, sustainable, just, affordable, and inclusive energy transitions,"" but made no mention of electric vehicles or the environmental impacts of nickel mining.

Muhammad Al Amin, executive director at WALHI South Sulawesi, says WALHI wants companies like PT Vale Indonesia to act fairly.

""This company has 118,000 hectares of concession land in South, Central and Southeast Sulawesi. If people ask for 20,000 hectares from the concession for their living space, I think this is a rational request,"" Al Amin told CNN.

Al Amin says that since the president declared he wanted Indonesia to be a major player in the electric vehicle industry, the organization had seen an increase in ""massive"" deforestation on Sulawesi.

As of 2022, South Sulawesi has lost 11% of its tree cover since 2000 with the greatest loss seen in East Luwu regency, according to Global Forest Watch , an initiative of the World Resources Institute.

""What the government never conveys is the impact of social and environmental damage that occurs around the industry,"" Al Amin told CNN. ""There are hundreds of families who are living in misery, living in poverty, due to the loss of their farms after being evicted by mining companies.""

And it's not just the loss of income. Masita says she and her family -- including her children and young grandchildren -- suffer from dust and noise pollution from the nickel mines. ""Often, we have to wear masks and glasses for protection,"" she said.

Nurhasiyah said residents in Loeha, which can only be accessed by ferry or through challenging rugged terrain, fear that environmental pollution from nickel mines will also leave them more vulnerable to sickness with limited to no access to medical centers.

We don't want the electric cars used every day to be made based on the suffering and cries of women. Muhammad Al Amin, executive director, WALHI South Sulawesi

CNN reached out to PT Vale Indonesia and the Indonesian government regarding these claims, but has not received a response from the government.

In its email to CNN, PT Vale Indonesia said it conducts environmental impact assessments and ""[we] ensure all decisions are well-communicated to stakeholders and community groups.""

On its global website, Vale says it recognizes its activities worldwide may cause ""significant environmental impacts"" and that it invests in ways to ""manage risks and minimize the socio-environmental impacts of our operations in the locations where we operate,"" as well as reduce pollutant emissions.

7,UPenn President Liz Magill under fire over her testimony on antisemitism: ‘An utter disgrace’,"New York CNN —

The growing chorus of donors, politicians, business leaders and other prominent figures calling for the immediate ouster of University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill has reached a crescendo after her disastrous testimony at a House hearing earlier this week.

During Tuesday’s House hearing, Magill, along with the presidents of Harvard and MIT, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

Magill had already been under fire prior to Tuesday’s hearing after multiple incidents of antisemitism on campus in recent months – and what critics have said was a tepid response to those incidents.

After the fallout from Tuesday’s hearing, Magill attempted to clarify her message on Wednesday, posting a video on X in which she said she should have focused on the “irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate.”

Magill said Wednesday that Penn’s policies “need to be clarified and evaluated,” adding that in her view: “It would be harassment or intimidation.”

Harvard University president Claudine Gay has apologized for her comments in an interview with the student newspaper Thursday.

“I am sorry,” Gay said to The Harvard Crimson. “Words matter.”

But Magill has not apologized. Penn’s stakeholders remain unsatisfied. Here is who is calling for Magill to resign:

A bipartisan group of more than 70 members of Congress on Friday sent a letter to board members of Harvard, MIT and Penn demanding Magill and her counterparts at the other two universities be dismissed.

“Given this moment of crisis, we demand that your boards immediately remove each of these presidents from their positions and that you provide an actionable plan to ensure that Jewish and Israeli students, teachers, and faculty are safe on your campuses,” the lawmakers wrote.

“The university presidents’ responses to questions aimed at addressing the growing trend of antisemitism on college and university campuses were abhorrent,” the lawmakers added.

Former US Ambassador Jon Huntsman Thursday night called on Penn’s board of trustees to remove Magill.

“Let’s make this great institution shine once again,” Huntsman said in a statement shared exclusively with CNN on Thursday evening. “We are anchored to the past until the trustees step up and completely cut ties with current leadership. Full stop.”

Huntsman, the former governor of Utah, was a 1987 graduate and former UPenn trustee. In October, he blasted Penn’s response to antisemitism on campus and promised to halt his family’s donations to the university. The Huntsman family has been such prominent supporters of UPenn that the Huntsman name is on the main Wharton School building.

Now, Huntsman is going further, calling for a complete leadership change.

“At this point it’s not even debatable,” Huntsman said. “Just a simple IQ test.”

Stone Ridge Holdings CEO Ross Stevens, a major donor to Penn, sent a letter on Thursday to Penn threatening to take steps that would cost the Ivy League school approximately $100 million if Magill stays on as president.

Stevens, a Penn alum and CEO of Stone Ridge Holdings, argues he has clear grounds to rescind $100 million worth of shares in his company that are currently held by Penn. He specifically cites Magill’s disastrous testimony before Congress earlier this week.

“Absent a change in leadership and values at Penn in the very near future, I plan to rescind Penn’s Stone Ridge shares to help prevent any further reputational and other damage to Stone Ridge as a result of our relationship with Penn and Liz Magill,” Stevens said in a note to his employees on Thursday obtained by CNN.

The Wharton Board of Advisors, comprised of a powerful group of business leaders, including NFL owner Josh Harris, former Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky, Related Companies CEO Jeff Blau, Blackstone exec David Blitzer and BET CEO Scott Mills, has called for Magill’s immediate ouster.

“As a result of the University leadership’s stated beliefs and collective failure to act, our Board respectfully suggests to you and the Board of Trustees that the University requires new leadership with immediate effect,” the Wharton Board of Advisors wrote in a letter sent directly to Magill.

The letter, which appears to have been sent Wednesday, specifically cites Magill’s testimony.

Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, called the testimony “catastrophic and clarifying” and said Magill’s attempt to clean-up her testimony “looked like a hostage video, like she was speaking under duress.”

“I understand why the governor of Pennsylvania and so many of the trustees don’t have confidence in her. I don’t have confidence anymore that Penn is capable, under this leadership, of getting it right,” Greenblatt told CNN’s Kate Bolduan, adding that he has spoken with Magill.

Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Thursday said she agrees with calls for the presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania to resign, arguing they are “failing in the worst way.”

“Their statements were abhorrent,” Gillibrand told Fox News, referring to Tuesday’s hearing in the House. “Trying to contextualize what constitutes harassment? Jewish students are terrified on these campuses.”","['huntsman', 'disgrace', 'penns', 'liz', 'ceo', 'board', 'hearing', 'upenn', 'university', 'utter', 'penn', 'president', 'tuesdays', 'testimony', 'leadership', 'antisemitism', 'magill']","During Tuesday’s House hearing, Magill, along with the presidents of Harvard and MIT, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment.

8,Diphtheria: West Africa battles worst outbreak in recent times,"CNN —

In Nigeria’s northern state of Kano, doctors and health workers are grappling with one of the worst diphtheria outbreaks in recent times.

Cases have been reported in the country since May of last year, but in the past few months, the outbreak has spread at an alarming rate, health officials say. Local, federal, and international bodies have struggled to contain the bacterial disease, with 17,000 suspected cases in Nigeria so far.

Worryingly, the outbreak has now spread to other West African countries such as Niger and Guinea and Medecins San Frontieres (MSF) says these nations are currently facing some of the most severe outbreaks of this vaccine-preventable disease ever documented on the continent.

However, the epicenter remains Kano, MSF health workers told CNN. So far, they have confirmed 9,310 cases and 368 deaths this year.

At its peak, MSF in Kano reported up to 700 cases a week. This rate dropped in September, but cases are slowly starting to rise again, currently at 500 weekly.

A bacterial disease

Diphtheria is a bacterial disease that creates a toxin that kills tissues and attacks cells in the respiratory system, making it hard for patients to breathe and swallow. If the toxin enters the bloodstream, it can damage the nervous system, and cause heart and kidney damage or paralysis, even after recovery, according to an MSF explainer on the disease.

Murjanatu Muhammad, a 30-year-old from Kano, has seen all of her children, 10-year-old Mohammed, eight-year-old Fatima, and twins Jamila and Husseina, aged five, admitted to hospital with diphtheria.

“You can imagine if we didn’t bring these children early enough, we don’t know what would have happened to them,” she told CNN.

For another mother, Firdausa Salisu, her son Auwal Nura has been sick since he was born four years ago and was receiving treatment from a traditional healer who advised against vaccines, his mother said.

“The traditional medicine man that was treating him advised that he should not be vaccinated at the time. By the time he recovered and I wanted him to be vaccinated, I was told he was past the age of receiving the vaccines.”

High mortality in children

Thousands of children like Auwal have experienced the alarming range of symptoms caused by diphtheria, says Dr. Hashim Juma.

Dr. Juma, with over 20 years of experience in the field, is currently based in Kano working as the emergency medical coordinator for MSF.

“This is very serious. Patients come in vomiting blood, paralysis in the legs… there is high mortality, particularly with children.” Dr. Hashim Juma, Medecins Sans Frontieres.

“Never have I ever faced this outbreak, in terms of the number of people infected, the mortality, and the complications as well,” he told CNN via a phone call from Kano.

“There are many diseases with complications, but this is very serious. Patients come in vomiting blood, paralysis in the legs… there is high mortality, particularly with children.”

Medical workers have been struggling to treat patients effectively, partly due to a lack of diphtheria anti-toxins (DAT).

So far, MSF says it has only been able to provide 5,000 DAT doses to patients.

With each severe case requiring eight to 10 vials each, this remains far from enough to support those who need it. Without treatment, patients face a roughly 50% chance of death, which reduces to a 5% chance if treated, Dr. Dagemlidet Tesfaye Worku, emergency medical program manager for West and Central Africa at MSF told CNN.

DAT doses and antibiotics are particularly hard to come by due to the lack of production, as well as the cost and time needed to manufacture.

A vial of diphtheria anti-toxin is prepared by a doctor at the treatment center in Kano Georg Gassauer/Medecin San Frontieres

Dr. Dagemlidet says that only three companies produce these doses, two of whom are approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).

He added that manufacturers need four weeks to make one batch of 1,500 DAT doses, and treating patients could cost up to 350 Euros ($370) from DAT alone. He believes this needs to change as soon as possible.

“In the short term, we need to improve production capacity of anti-toxins. Long term, we need to invest in research and development,” Dr. Dagemlidet says.

“It’s a global health crisis… in our globalized world, an outbreak can happen here, or in an urban area somewhere else. Global health security is so important.”

Vaccine mistrust

Vaccination has also played a crucial role in this ongoing outbreak. Whilst some vaccine uptake has helped prevent infections, there are a number of barriers from increasing uptake.

As of November, only 30% of patients in Kano had full vaccine protection, according to MSF. This rate is at its lowest in the northwestern state of Sokoto at just 6%. In response, WHO and UNICEF have started a vaccination campaign across 14 states in Nigeria.

Dr. Juma explains that in Kano there is mistrust and lack of awareness surrounding vaccines. He says: “There is a vaccine hesitancy here. People have had a bad experience with the side effects before. During our first intervention, we could see people were not highly welcoming to the vaccine team.”

The lack of vaccination coverage also applies to the rest of West Africa, with 65% of diphtheria patients having never received a single vaccine dose.

In late November, WHO published an updated explainer on diphtheria, emphasizing the importance of high vaccine uptake to tackle the outbreak. The organization recommends six vaccine doses to babies at six weeks old to provide long-term protection.

GAVI, a vaccine alliance programme, also announced on December 4 that eligible countries can now apply to implement diphtheria vaccines into their health programs.

As the outbreak has escalated since July, Dr. Juma has seen vaccine uptake improve. In order to contain this surge of diphtheria, and help prevent future outbreaks too, this trend must continue.

With the disease now present in neighboring Niger, there is concern that once again the population is not adequately equipped. Dr. Juma says that there is little to no vaccination coverage there, a great concern considering the high level of movement between Kano and Niger.

In order to address the outbreak, the message is clear. Vaccination must improve. Dr. Juma says: “We stress the need to make the routine vaccination system stronger and stronger… then you can control the outbreak.”

Lessons have also been learned regarding doses of antitoxins and antibiotics, explains Dr. Dagemlidet. He says: “We need to have at least a minimum quantity of anti-toxins in each country, so when the first cases happen, adequate resources are available to help local areas.

“The best way of responding to emergencies is anticipation and prevention.”","['juma', 'outbreak', 'worst', 'patients', 'recent', 'vaccine', 'diphtheria', 'kano', 'africa', 'msf', 'dr', 'health', 'battles', 'need', 'west', 'times']","CNN —In Nigeria’s northern state of Kano, doctors and health workers are grappling with one of the worst diphtheria outbreaks in recent times.

9,"Live updates: Israel-Hamas war, US vetoes UN resolution calling for Gaza ceasefire","Images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday showed a mass detention by the Israeli military of men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle. Obtained by CNN

The Israeli military is apprehending military-aged men in northern Gaza to “work out who the terrorists are,” the Israeli Government spokesperson told CNN on Friday.

Eylon Levy was responding to questioning from CNN’s Brianna Keilar about images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday, which showed men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds, and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle.

“When we find military-aged men in areas that we have been urging an evacuation of for over a month – because these are Hamas strongholds where we have seen intense urban fighting – we need to apprehend those people, work out who the terrorists are,” Levy said.

Those who are determined not to be “terrorists” will be released, he added.

At least some of the men detained as part of the operation depicted in the social media images were civilians with no known affiliation to militant groups, according to a conversation CNN had with one of their relatives and a statement by one of their employers, a news network.

The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said Friday that dozens of suspects arrested by Israel in Gaza had been taken to Israeli territory for questioning.

“The people we’re seeing in these images are all suspected terrorists,” Levy said.

“We wish that all Hamas fighters were wearing uniforms that clearly said Hamas on their helmets, because that would make them easier to identify them. But when Hamas dresses up as civilians, and fights within civilian areas, they make it very difficult to find them.”

Some context: The Israeli military for weeks told Gazans to leave northern Gaza, and head south. Now that the Israeli military has invaded southern Gaza, it has told Gazans to head for a small strip of land in southwestern Gaza, along the Mediterranean coast.

But the main UN agency working in the Palestinian territories, UNRWA, says there is no such thing as a “safe zone” in Gaza. “The entire Gaza Strip has become one of the most dangerous places in the world,” it said in a statement. “There is nowhere to go as shelters, including UNRWA, are overflowing.”

Over 1.9 million Gazans, or 85% of the population are internally displaced, according to The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.","['calling', 'updates', 'live', 'israelhamas', 'israeli', 'men', 'terrorists', 'hamas', 'ceasefire', 'military', 'images', 'war', 'resolution', 'gaza', 'told', 'strip', 'vetoes', 'social']","Obtained by CNNThe Israeli military is apprehending military-aged men in northern Gaza to “work out who the terrorists are,” the Israeli Government spokesperson told CNN on Friday.

11,US State Department asks Congress to approve sales of tank munitions to Israel,"CNN —

The US State Department has asked Congress to approve a sale of tens of thousands of munitions for Israeli tanks, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN.

The request, which the source said was received within the last week and is being reviewed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is for 45,000 shells for Israeli Merkava tanks, the source said. The source added that the committees are under “pressure” from the State Department to approve the request quickly amid Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.

The request comes as the US is under growing domestic and international pressure to support a ceasefire in Gaza, and place conditions on some of the weapons it is providing to Israel.

“As a matter of policy, we do not confirm or comment on proposed defense transfers or sales until they have been formally notified to Congress,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN when asked about the request.

Reuters first reported the request.

In early November, the State Department formally notified congressional leaders that it would be transferring $320 million worth of precision-guided bomb equipment to Israel, CNN previously reported.

Israel has received 200 cargo planes of military equipment from “several countries” since the Hamas terror attack on October 7, including ammunition, armored vehicles, and weapons, according to the Israeli Ministry of Defense.

The Israeli ministry said more than 10,000 tons of military equipment have been delivered since the start of the war.

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense said the aid had come from “several countries,” but declined to say what other countries had sent aid or how much of it had come from the United States.

The shipments of US military aid began soon after the war began. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was in Israel on October 13 as a C-17 cargo plane landed with security assistance to Israel.

“There’s a lot more that follows this,” Austin said at the time.

Unlike security assistance to Ukraine where the US details types of weapons and capabilities, the shipments to Israel have been far more discrete, with the Defense Department rarely acknowledging or announcing what types of weapons or equipment it is sending.

In late-October, a senior defense official said the US was expediting the delivery of precision-guided joint direct attack munitions (JDAMs) to Israel, which turn unguided bombs into smart weapons. The US has also expedited the delivery of Iron Dome interceptor missiles for Israel’s primary aerial defense system.

The use of US weapons in Israel’s ongoing war has drawn increased scrutiny following an Amnesty International report this week which claimed that US-made JDAMs were used in two strikes in October which killed 43 civilians. The human rights organization said it “did not find any indication that there were any military objectives at the sites,” a conclusion the Israeli military rejected as “flawed, biased and premature.”

The US State Department and the Defense Department both said they are reviewing Amnesty International’s report.

“We have made clear in our discussions with Israeli leaders that we are deeply concerned about the protection of civilians in this conflict,” State Department spokesman Matt Miller said Wednesday. “We expect Israel to only target legitimate targets and to adhere to the laws of armed conflict.”

12,"Israeli tank fire killed Reuters journalist in October attack, CNN analysis suggests","CNN —

Israeli tank fire killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and injured six other international journalists in a double strike in southern Lebanon on October 13, forensic analysis by CNN suggests, confirming reports by two news organizations and two human rights groups.

On Thursday, Reuters, AFP, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch released investigations into the circumstances of the deadly strike. AFP and HRW claimed the strike was a “deliberate,” targeted attack by Israel on the journalists. In a statement to Reuters, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Richard Hecht said: “We don’t target journalists.” He did not provide further comment, the news agency reported.

The Israel Defense Forces on Friday said that the October incident in which a Reuters journalist was killed is still “under review.”

AFP photographer Christina Assi had her leg amputated and remains in the hospital as a result of the strike, according to AFP.

Eylon Levy, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, said Thursday that he was “not familiar” with the new reports. “The guiding principle in Israel’s campaign against Hamas is we uphold the principles of international law regarding proportionality, necessity, distinction,” he said. “We target Hamas, we do not target civilians.”

CNN’s forensic analysis of multiple videos, including a live AFP video feed from the time and place of the attack, has determined that the two strikes – 37 seconds apart – that hit the journalists was a supersonic event that came from the direction of Israel.

Israel and Hezbollah were engaged in intense crossfire across the Lebanon-Israel border at the time.

CNN has also seen a photo from the scene of the attack showing the tail fin of a 120 mm tank shell. The photo was verified by a source familiar with the investigation.

Neither the Lebanese army nor the Iran-backed Hezbollah are known to have such ammunition in their arsenal.

“That is a 120mm high explosive tank shell. Very clearly high explosive and not a different type of shell,” said Marc Garlasco, a former defense intelligence analyst and UN war crimes investigator, who saw the photo obtained by CNN as well as video of the aftermath of the attack. “(Aftermath video is) very indicative of a direct fire munition and matches with the 120 fragments.”

“The shooter should have seen the journalists from the tank,” he added.

British weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith said the photograph of the remnants of the shell clearly showed an “expended tank round.”

“Two projectiles hit the area of the media crews and from the damage to the wall, the location where Issam’s body ended up and from an analysis of the second crater, I believe the shots came from the area of the high ground just over the border,” said Cobb-Smith, referring to a foot-high wall seen in aftermath video near Abdallah’s body. Cobb-Smith said his analysis of the damage left by the projectile suggested that the attack came from a southeasterly direction.

CNN also consulted with audio expert Robert Maher, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University.

Maher determined that the attack was likely a “supersonic event” due to the absence of an “approaching whoosh or whine, as you might see with artillery fire.”

Cobb-Smith’s theory that the shells travelled from the southeast would be consistent of the findings of the investigations released Thursday.

Hours after the attack on October 13, CNN reported that the journalists attacked were wearing clearly labelled press flak jackets. It also reported that an Israeli Apache helicopter was seen over the site of the attack around the time of the attack, according to a Lebanese security source, which would have given Israeli forces added visibility over the journalists.

Israeli surveillance towers are seen in video of the attack, raising further doubt that Israel had not realized the tank crew was attacking journalists.

‘Under review’

In its statement Friday, the IDF said, “On October 13, 2023, the terrorist organization Hezbollah launched an attack on multiple targets within Israeli territory along the Lebanese border,” the IDF said in a statement. “One incident involved the firing of an anti-tank missile, which struck the border fence near the village Hanita.”

CNN reported that exchange of fire at the time of the incident.

“Following the launch of the anti-tank missile, concerns arose over the potential infiltration of terrorists into Israeli territory. In response, the IDF used artillery and tank fire to prevent the infiltration. The IDF is aware of the claim that journalists who were in the area were killed,” the statement continued.

“The area is an active combat zone, where active fire takes place and being in this area is dangerous. The incident is currently under review,” the IDF said.

IDF spokesperson Richard Hecht on October 14 called Abdallah’s death “a tragic thing,” without naming him directly or acknowledging Israel’s involvement. The same day, the IDF said: “A report was received that during the incident, journalists were injured in the area. The incident is under review.”

Speaking Thursday in Washington, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Abdallah’s death should be investigated. Blinken said it was his understanding that Israel had begun such an investigation and stressed the importance of seeing it through.

A Pentagon spokeswoman said earlier that the agency had not conducted its own assessment of Abdallah’s death but it continued to urge Israel to protect innocent civilians, including members of the press.

Al Jazeera has accused Israel’s military of “deliberately targeting the journalists to silence the media,” saying the attacks are a part of “a pattern of ‘repeated atrocities’ against journalists.”

The Committee to Protect Journalists also said the results of the investigations by Reuters, AFP, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch were in alignment with its own findings that show a “pattern of lethal force” by the Israeli military against journalists over the past 22 years.

The press freedoms group had documented at least 20 journalist killings by the IDF since 2001, it said in a report released May 2023. “The vast majority – 18 – were Palestinian. No one has ever been charged or held accountable for these deaths,” the report said.

‘Deliberate and targeted’

Amnesty International’s investigation did not find “any indication that there were any fighters or military objectives at the site of the strikes.”

“Israeli forces had observation towers, ground elements, and air assets deployed to closely monitor the border. All of this should have provided sufficient information to Israeli forces that these were journalists and civilians and not a military target,” Amnesty said in its report.

“Our investigation into the incident uncovers chilling evidence pointing to an attack on a group of international journalists who were carrying out their work by reporting on hostilities. Direct attacks on civilians and indiscriminate attacks are absolutely prohibited by international humanitarian law and can amount to war crimes,” said Aya Majzoub, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.

“The strikes were deliberate and targeted,” AFP said in its report. AFP global news director Phil Chetwynd said in the report, “AFP has been very clear that we will take all judicial avenues that we deem relevant and possible to ensure that we can get justice for Christina and Issam.”

Dylan Collins, a journalist with AFP who survived the attack, told CNN it was “hard not to see it as a deliberate strike.”

Collins, AFP’s Lebanon/Syria video coordinator, recounted what started as a “pretty quiet day,” describing how teams of Reuters and AFP journalists, all wearing flak jackets, helmets with press written across them, moved toward a plume of smoke after hearing “loud bangs” along the Lebanon-Israel border.

“The Israelis had drones in the air the entire time. And I imagine you know with their state-of-the-art surveillance capabilities, they could see our faces, they probably knew which channels we were working for… At around 6:02 that evening, we were struck directly,” Collins added.

13,Al-Nasr hospital: Infants found dead and decomposing in evacuated Gaza ICU. Here’s what we know,"Editor’s Note: The following story includes graphic material. Audience discretion is advised.

CNN —

The scene inside the Al-Nasr hospital ICU ward is chilling. The tiny bodies of babies, several still attached to wires and tubes that were meant to keep them alive, decomposing in their hospital beds. Milk bottles and spare diapers still next to them on the sheets.

The video inside the hospital was filmed on November 27 by Mohamed Baalousha, a Gaza reporter for UAE-based news outlet Al Mashhad. He shared an unblurred version with CNN, which shows the remains of at least four infants.

Three of them appear to be still connected to hospital machines. The bodies of the babies appear to be darkening and disintegrating from decay, with little more than skeletons left in some of the beds. Flies and maggots are visibly crawling across the skin of one child.

The circumstances around one of the most horrifying videos to emerge from the war in Gaza remain unclear, but after days of piecing together available information, using interviews, published statements and video, a chaotic scene can been painted of hospital staff trying to protect their most vulnerable patients, caught in the middle of a raging battle – waiting for help that never arrived.

Here is what CNN found

CNN geolocated the video to Al-Nasr hospital in northern Gaza. This area has been largely unreachable to journalists in recent weeks due to the intensity of fighting but during the seven-day truce Baalousha says he was able to access the hospital to film what was left there.

From early November, the Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi children’s hospitals, which form part of the same complex, had become the frontline of fighting between Israeli and Hamas forces.

In public statements and interviews, several medical staff and health officials from Al-Nasr said they had to hurriedly evacuate the hospital on November 10, under the direction of Israeli forces.

Medical staff described having to leave young children behind in the ICU because they had no means to safely move them.

A doctor associated with the hospital, who did not want to be named, told CNN that two of the children – a two-year-old and a nine-month-old baby – had died shortly before the evacuation but that three children were left alive still connected to respirators. One of those left alive was two months old. Several of the infants on the ICU had been suffering from genetic disorders, according to the doctor.

The condition of those left behind alive – both at the time the fighting reached the hospital and when the evacuation took place – remains unclear.

In a video on November 9, the head of Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi pediatric hospitals, Dr. Mustafa al-Kahlout, said Al-Nasr hospital had been “struck twice” sustaining “a lot of damage.”

Kahlout warned oxygen to the ICU “was cut off” and reported at least one patient had died as a result, with others facing the risk of death.

It’s unclear whether oxygen cylinders, seen next to some of the beds in the video from the hospital, were functioning or whether supplies had run out.

“The situation is really bad, we are surrounded… ambulances cannot reach the hospital, and ambulances that tried to reach Al-Nasr were targeted,” Kahlout said, calling on international organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to intervene and save the medical staff and patients who remained in the ICU.

Video shared on social media on November 9, which CNN verified, was filmed from inside Al-Nasr hospital and appears to show the aftermath of the building being hit.

Another from November 10 showed an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tank outside Al-Nasr, indicating the IDF was operating in the area. Another video from the same date showed civilians holding up makeshift white flags attempting to flee the hospital amid gunfire, then being forced to run back inside. It is not possible to tell from the video who is shooting.

Satellite imagery reviewed by CNN from November 11 shows large craters around the hospital complex, indicating the area had been under bombardment, making evacuation difficult.

But, in an audio recording of a conversation between a senior official at Al-Rantisi hospital and an officer from COGAT, which coordinates the Israeli government’s activities in the Palestinian territories and Gaza, it appears Israeli forces instructed hospital patients and staff to evacuate.

In the recording, released by the IDF on November 11, the Israeli officer assures the hospital official that ambulances will be arranged.

The hospital official tells the COGAT officer that ambulances cannot reach the hospital, and the officer replies: “I’ll arrange coordination with the primary aid center. Don’t worry, I’m near the army, it will be okay.”

“Will the ambulances take the patients and the medical staff?” the hospital official asks.

“No problem,” the COGAT officer responds, in the recording.

The hospital official then confirms that the COGAT officer is aware that people will be evacuating both Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi hospitals, and the COGAT officer says “yes, yes.”

But hospital officials say the ambulances never arrived.

“Many of the patients were carried out by their families, ambulances couldn’t reach the hospital,” Kahlout said in a news conference on November 14, following the evacuation.

Three children were left in the ICU attached to hospital machines but without oxygen, Kahlout said.

In an audio recording from November 10 released by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) a nurse who the organization said was volunteering in a personal capacity, said the hospital had been shelled, hitting multiple floors, water tanks, and electricity and oxygen stations.

The nurse – who CNN is not identifying for security reasons – said Al-Nasr staff were given 30 minutes to evacuate by the IDF, adding no ambulances were able to reach the hospital.

“We walked out a little bit there was shooting around us,” he said in the recording. Then he said someone from the IDF told him “I’ll give you safe passage, you have from 1130am until 12 noon.”

“So, we walked out with our hands up in the air carrying white flags and carrying families and children,” the nurse said in the recording.

He said he managed to carry one baby with him as he escaped and handed it to an ambulance headed for the Al-Shifa hospital. But four children were left behind in the ICU according to the nurse, in a discrepancy from the number given by Kahlout.

“To leave my patient dying in front of my eyes is the hardest thing I have ever experienced, it’s indescribable, they broke our hearts, we couldn’t help them, we couldn’t take them, we barely left ourselves with our children, we are civilians, we are a medical crew, we are displaced civilians,” he said in the recording.

Over the past week, CNN has tried to speak to medical staff and hospital officials from Al-Nasr, but all have either said they are too afraid to speak or cannot be reached.

The director of Gaza’s hospitals at the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health, Dr. Mohammad Zaqout, told CNN that people in the hospital were forced to leave by the IDF.

“We were forced to leave them behind to die because we didn’t have a safe medical evacuation… we informed them that these children were on beds and couldn’t be evacuated. We held other children in our arms while being forced to evacuate,” Zaqout said.

The IDF has strongly denied responsibility for the deaths of the children in Al-Nasr ICU. “Given that the IDF did not operate inside the Al-Nasr hospital, these allegations are not only false but also a perverse exploitation of innocent lives, used as tools to spread dangerous misinformation,” the IDF said in a statement to CNN.

Asked repeatedly by CNN why it hadn’t provided ambulances for the evacuation, as the COGAT officer had promised in the recorded conversation with the hospital official, and if they were aware of the presence of children left in the ICU, as Zaqout alleged, the IDF did not directly respond.

During an online Q&A for journalists Saturday, IDF spokesman Doron Spielman dismissed the story as merely a “rumor.”

“There were no premature babies that decomposed because of the IDF. There were probably no babies that decomposed whatsoever,” Spielman said. “But Hamas is in charge of Nasr hospital, we are not occupying Nasr hospital.”

Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals as command centers and even as places to hold hostages.

Zaqout denies the allegation and has repeatedly called for “neutral entities, human rights organizations, and media outlets to enter the hospitals and verify for themselves that they are used solely for civilian and humanitarian purposes.”

CNN cannot independently confirm what state the children were in when they were left at the hospital. But Stefan Schmitt, a forensic scientist at Florida International University reviewed the video for CNN and said the level of decomposition of the infants was advanced.

Schmitt said he believed the room had not been disturbed since the children were left. “Those remains decomposed in situ, meaning they decomposed there on those beds,” he said. “You can see that from the bodily fluids that have leaked out over the time of decomposition.”

Schmitt also said one of the corpses appeared to be wrapped in fabric, possibly a shroud, noting there was no medical equipment attached to the body, suggesting the body may already have been dead or severely injured. The room appeared to have been abandoned in a hurry, Schmitt continued, noting the infant car seat and what appears to be a bag packed for one of the children next to its bed.

A statement from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health issued in response to the video of the babies’ remains said Al-Nasr nursing staff were ordered to leave by the IDF, who told them the ICRC was coming to evacuate the patients.

“Instead, their decomposed bodies were found in their beds,” reads the statement. “These babies drew their last breaths alone and died alone.”

The ICRC told CNN it received “several requests” for evacuation from hospitals in the north of Gaza, but due to the “security situation” it was “not involved in any operations or evacuations, nor did teams commit to doing so.” The ICRC added the footage of the deceased children was an “unspeakable tragedy.”

14,US officials discuss post-war Gaza governance plans with Palestinian Authority and Arab nations,"Washington CNN —

US officials are discussing post-war Gaza governance plans with the Palestinian Authority along with regional US allies – making it a key focus as they try to look beyond the immediate conflict.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Friday afternoon with a delegation of Arab counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority, where the topic of Gaza after the Israeli offensive was expected to be a main point of discussion.

Shortly before the meeting began, the US vetoed a UN resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

A draft version of the resolution, presented by the United Arab Emirates, had called for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,” as well as “the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages” and “ensuring humanitarian access,” according to a draft copy.

The US was the lone veto. The UK abstained because the resolution did not condemn the October 7 Hamas attack.

When the war is over, US officials have said they ultimately envision both Gaza and the West Bank being ruled by a unified government led by a “revitalized” Palestinian Authority.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who initially rebuffed the idea of the PA ruling Gaza on the heels of the Israeli offensive, has shifted his position. Still, many questions remain about the immediate “day after” for Gaza once the war ends. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Wednesday that the US understands that there will be “some kind of transition period” in which Israeli forces remain in Gaza after the end of combat operations, but that cannot be permanent.

A Western diplomat told CNN that in past conversations the Arab delegation has made clear that they are not eager to be involved with an international force to provide security in Gaza after the war. The ministers have also said that if the world wants Arab states to play a role in reconstruction and support of the PA, there must be a path towards a Palestinian state.

At a press conference in Washington, DC, Friday, the delegation underscored that they were not willing to discuss the “day after” solely in the context of Gaza, but rather in the context of a Palestinian state.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi suggested on CNN they would not play a role in an international peacekeeping force, and condemned Israel’s offensive.

“All of us are losing our credibility,” he told Jim Sciutto on “CNN Newsroom” on Max.

“We are losing credibility in front of our people because our own people are looking at us and saying, ‘Okay, you’re demanding that Israel stop. It’s not. The whole international community has failed to act in any meaningful manner to stop the massacre,’” he said. “So. Everybody’s losing credibility. Moderation is losing credibility. The camp of peace is losing credibility. So that is a danger with which we we’re going to have to reckon at some point or the other.”

The delegation reiterated their call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and cast aspersions on members of the international community – like the US – for failing to advocate for one.

A senior administration official said that privately there is some consternation within the administration over the US’ Arab allies’ reluctance to play any role in a post-war international peacekeeping force, since they have been among the loudest in condemning Israel’s assault on Gaza. One Arab ambassador told CNN that their country would “absolutely not” place any of its own forces in Gaza after the war. Part of that is because the Arab states do not want to be seen as subjugating the Palestinians, the ambassador explained.

The Biden administration has consistently advocated for a two-state solution. Last month, Blinken laid out the administration’s terms for “durable peace and security” in Gaza after the war, which include no Israeli re-occupation and no reduction in territory. As such, the US is opposed to the establishment of an Israeli security buffer zone within Gaza after the war.

Vice President Kamala Harris also raised post-conflict Gaza in multiple meetings and calls with Arab leaders last weekend when in Dubai, telling reporters that she shared what expectations the US will have with regard to post-conflict planning.

“Specifically, I proposed three areas of focus,” Harris said, citing reconstruction of infrastructure in Gaza, reinforcing Palestinian Authority security and revitalizing PA governance. Harris also reiterated that a two-state solution is the best path forward.

Blinken met with Abbas in Ramallah last week. Harris’ national security adviser, Phil Gordon, held additional meetings in the West Bank this week.

“He underscored our commitment to the future establishment of a Palestinian state and made clear that the Palestinian people must have a hopeful political horizon. To that end, Dr. Gordon discussed the revitalization of the Palestinian Authority,” according to a White House readout.

It’s an extension of what US national security officials have telegraphed as it relates to Gaza and the PA.

“Leadership choices – these are, of course, up to the Palestinian people and Palestinians themselves. But there are a number of things that we think would be critical to making sure that, again, the Palestinian Authority can be effective in helping to advance the aspirations and the needs of its people,” Blinken said last week.

Deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said last month that the PA will “have to be part” of any future governing solution in both the West Bank and Gaza following the current hostilities – a prospect that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has explicitly opposed.

The senior administration official told CNN that the apparent disagreement between the US and Israel over a future role for the PA is overstated. The US agrees that the Palestinian Authority in its current, weakened state would be unlikely to be able to govern Gaza, but that a “revitalized” PA – including potentially with new leadership entirely – is a plausible solution.

Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told Bloomberg that he sees a role for Hamas in future Gaza governance – a prospect that would also be firmly rejected by Israel, whose stated goal is to eliminate the group. US officials have said there cannot be a return to the “status quo” before October 7. The Western diplomat told CNN that privately, many of the Arab partners also do not want Hamas to remain in control in Gaza.

It’s not clear that such an arrangement is even possible, given the long history of enmity between Hamas in Gaza and its bitter political rival Fatah, which controls the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The two sides have tried – and failed – multiple times to reach an agreement to unite the two separate Palestinian territories under one governance structure.

Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation agreement in Cairo in October 2017 under pressure from the Arab states, led by Egypt. Under the deal, a new unity government was supposed to take administrative control of Gaza two months later, ending a decade of rivalry that began when Hamas violently evicted the Palestinian Authority from Gaza in 2007.

But the deal’s lofty aspirations quickly collapsed. When Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah visited Gaza in March 2018, he was the target of an assassination attempt when a bomb detonated near his convoy. Hamdallah’s Fatah party immediately blamed Hamas for the attack.

15,Egypt’s president expected to secure third term as the world’s eyes are fixed on Gaza,"CNN —

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to secure his third term in power in a Sunday presidential election that critics have called a sham, as global attention is focused on the bloody war in neighboring Gaza.

The 69-year-old president has enjoyed two months of a pause in criticism from Western allies over his authoritarian rule and heightened crackdown on dissent, experts say, attributing the shift to Sisi’s renewed diplomatic relevance on the international stage due to the Israel-Hamas war.

Several top Western officials have paid Sisi visits since the war began, including United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

HA Hellyer, nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in London, said that Cairo has historically been “a critical interlocutor for the international community in general when it comes to the Arab-Israeli conflict.”

“As the Israeli-Palestinian question diminished in importance in many policy arenas, which was clearly a fundamentally flawed approach, so did Cairo’s geopolitical weight,” Hellyer told CNN, adding that with the Palestinian issue now prominently back in discussions, “there is a new prioritization internationally for good and comprehensive contact with Egypt.”

Egypt controls the Rafah crossing, the sole remaining link between the Gaza Strip – which Hamas controls – and the outside world. Egyptian officials have played mediation roles in previous wars between Israel and Hamas, as Cairo maintains diplomatic ties with both sides. During the current conflict, Egypt’s good offices have been used to deliver crucial aid into Gaza and to help secure the release of some of the hostages held there by Hamas since its militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting more than 240 others.

Egypt has also helped foreign nationals escape the carnage in Gaza, along with injured Palestinians. More than 17,000 Palestinians have so far been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which cites sources from the Hamas-controlled enclave. Aid has also been able to trickle into Gaza through Rafah.

Meanwhile, Sisi is moving to quietly secure another presidential term with little to no opposition at home or abroad, critics say.

“There are no elections. There is electoral theater,” Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington, DC, told CNN, citing the lack of viable opposition to Sisi.

The former field marshal rose to power in 2013 after overthrowing Mohamed Morsy, Egypt’s only democratically elected president, in a military coup. Sisi ran for president in 2014 and 2018, winning both elections with a sweeping majority. In 2019, his government passed constitutional amendments that permitted him to run for a third term.

“The terrible violence we’re witnessing (in Gaza) helped Sisi divide the attention of the public from their domestic concerns onto what’s happening, particularly the Palestinians in Gaza,” Kaldas said. “And as a result, somewhat reduce the level of focus on their own domestic plight, particularly their economic struggles.”

Egypt has also spent the past two months reminding its international partners of how “vitally important” it is, Kaldas said. Egypt can say: “See the useful role we play in negotiations and facilitation of the humanitarian assistance that needs to go to Gaza,” he added.

Sisi has appeared keen to capitalize on the crisis and present himself as a champion of the Palestinian cause. In a speech last month, the president repeated his call for a ceasefire, as well as his refusal of the “displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip,” calling such a prospect a red line.

While diplomats have been focused on Gaza, critics and human rights groups have lambasted Egypt over the past two months for what they say is its suppression of political dissent and silencing of opposition candidates.

Former lawmaker Ahmed el-Tantawy, who was the most prominent potential challenger to Sisi before he ended his campaign in October, said his supporters were restricted from registering their endorsements for him. He ended his campaign after failing to register the number of signatures required to run.

The Egyptian National Elections Authority (NEA) denied el-Tantawy’s claims, according to state media.

Three other candidates are running for president, with little support expected for each. These are the head of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, Farid Zahran; Wafd party nominee Abdel Sanad Yamama; and Republican Peoples’ Party candidate Hazem Omar.

Rights watchdog Amnesty International said last month that “genuine opposition candidates (were) barred from running” in Sunday’s election, adding that since October 1, Egyptian authorities “have arrested and interrogated at least 196 individuals due to their participation in unauthorized protests, as well as on allegations of engaging in terrorism-related activities and spreading ‘false news.’”

Amnesty also criticized Egypt’s prosecution of el-Tantawy, along with members of his campaign, which the rights group says are under fire “in retaliation for exercising their rights to political participation and to freedom of expression and association.”

El-Tantawy is accused of circulating election-related papers without the permission of the authorities. His trial date was pushed to January 9.

“Once more, the Egyptian authorities lay bare their utter intolerance for even the faintest whisper of dissent,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, as he urged the country to lift “sweeping restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.”

The Egyptian government’s foreign press center did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.

‘No one will come out to vote’

Just days before the election, streets in the capital, Cairo, were draped with large banners bearing Sisi’s portrait. An increased security presence is noticeable throughout the city, with officers and checkpoints dotting squares, highways and the entrances to bridges.

Among those boosting the pro-Sisi campaign is the Nation’s Future Party. “We are all with you” and “beloved of millions,” read the party’s pro-Sisi banners.

Despite the president’s high-profile election campaign, public sentiment is marked by frustration. Grievances regarding the economy are most evident.

Magdy Gerges, an Egyptian in his 50s who works as a driver, said economic hardships were painful, but that he feels a sense of security under Sisi’s rule.

“I’m one of those who suffer from the high prices, but this man (Sisi) gives me something more important than food; that I feel safe whenever my daughters go out,” Gerges told CNN. “By the end of the day, we will manage with our income, but what good is money if there is no security?” he said.

Gerges noted however that there are no other viable alternative candidates for voters to choose from, especially given the region’s precarious security situation.

“Even if we want to choose someone else, we have no alternative,” he said.

Another citizen, who asked to remain anonymous fearing reprisal from Egyptian authorities, questioned the legitimacy of Sunday’s election, saying polling stations will be empty since Sisi’s victory is clear.

“No one will come out to vote. People know the result in advance, so why this farce?” the man told CNN, saying it might have been better to “save these huge sums of money in the difficult economic conditions we are living in.”

Hellyer, of the Carnegie Endowment, said that with the current crisis in Gaza, Cairo might even see “potential for substantial economic assistance” from foreign nations, given the role it has played.

Egypt has been struggling to dig itself out of a debt hole that experts say requires structural reforms to avert economic collapse. Cairo’s allies in the Persian Gulf, who for years bailed out the most populous Arab nation, had in recent months criticized Egypt, saying the days of blank cheques are now over.

Egypt’s economic woes are far from resolved. Inflation is still high, and a foreign currency crisis remains unremedied. The country is also yet to meet the terms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $3 billion loan secured in December 2022 but which is yet to be disbursed.

Kaldas, of the Tahrir Institute, said that the Egyptian pound is expected to devalue further. The dollar now trades officially at 31 Egyptian pounds, and if the government decides to further devalue the exchange rate after the elections, that will translate to higher inflation, a deepening of economic hardship for individuals and businesses, and a rise in poverty, he said.

“There is no short-term scenario that doesn’t mean more economic pain for the average Egyptian,” Kaldas added.

The election takes place from December 10 to December 12. Results are expected by December 18.","['worlds', 'international', 'egyptian', 'economic', 'expected', 'sisi', 'egypt', 'opposition', 'eyes', 'egypts', 'president', 'gaza', 'term', 'cairo', 'election', 'secure', 'fixed']","CNN —Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to secure his third term in power in a Sunday presidential election that critics have called a sham, as global attention is focused on the bloody war in neighboring Gaza.

16,Harvard President apologizes for her comments during her congressional testimony in an interview with the student newspaper,"CNN —

The president of Harvard University apologized in an interview with the school’s student newspaper after facing widespread condemnation for her disastrous congressional testimony this week, in which she and other university presidents failed to explicitly say calls for genocide of Jewish people constituted bullying and harassment on campus.

“I am sorry,” Harvard University president Claudine Gay said to The Harvard Crimson on Thursday. “Words matter.”

The apology came just days after Gay, the president of the University of Pennsylvania and the president of MIT testified at a House committee hearing focused on antisemitism on campus, to widespread criticism that they have not done enough to ensure the safety of Jewish students and others at their respective schools.

Harvard, UPenn and MIT have all come under fire – along with other US academic institutions – over perceived inaction against antisemitism on their campuses, especially in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel and the subsequent war.

At UPenn, for example, President Liz Magill has been under pressure to resign for weeks, as major donors and others say they have lost confidence in her ability to lose the school.

Harvard is also among 14 colleges under investigation by the Department of Education “for discrimination involving shared ancestry” since the October attacks.

During Tuesday’s House hearing, Gay, along with the UPenn and MIT presidents, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

Gay told the Harvard student paper that she regretted what she said.

“When words amplify distress and pain, I don’t know how you could feel anything but regret,” she said to The Crimson.

“I got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures,” Gay told the newspaper. “What I should have had the presence of mind to do in that moment was return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our Jewish community — threats to our Jewish students — have no place at Harvard, and will never go unchallenged.”

“Substantively, I failed to convey what is my truth,” she added.

The Harvard president told the paper she’s heard about how much pain students are in over the past few months.

“To contemplate that something I said amplified that pain — that’s really difficult,” Gay said to The Crimson. “It makes me sad.”

Flood of criticism

Gay has faced plenty of calls to resign, most notably from Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, a Harvard graduate who has been a vocal critic of how universities have addressed antisemitism on campus

“Throughout the hearing, the three behaved like hostile witnesses,” Ackman wrote in a post on X earlier this week, “exhibiting a profound disdain for the Congress with their smiles and smirks, and their outright refusal to answer basic questions with a yes or no answer.”

“They must all resign in disgrace,” Ackman said.

But the criticism from donors, politicians, alumni and business leaders has been reserved mostly for UPenn’s Magill, who appears most imminently at risk of losing her job. She faces a donor rebellion, including a threat from one donor to pull a $100 million gift. The Wharton board also said it wants Magill ousted.

Underscoring the anger at the three university presidents’ testimony, on Friday a bipartisan group of more than 70 US lawmakers sent a letter to board members of all three universities, demanding the dismissal of Gay and the presidents of UPenn and MIT.

“Given this moment of crisis, we demand that your boards immediately remove each of these presidents from their positions and that you provide an actionable plan to ensure that Jewish and Israeli students, teachers, and faculty are safe on your campuses,” the lawmakers wrote.

“The university presidents’ responses to questions aimed at addressing the growing trend of antisemitism on college and university campuses were abhorrent,” the bipartisan group added.

Magill, like Gay, clarified her remarks Wednesday, a day after the controversial testimony. Magill said in a short video that she should have been more forceful in her condemnation of hate speech, particularly calls for genocide.

17,Rishi Sunak is picking a fight on the migration issue that he probably cannot win,"CNN —

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has a major problem.

As his governing Conservative Party prepares to enter what will likely be an election year in 2024, it is languishing behind the opposition Labour Party in polls week after week.

The Conservatives have been in power since 2010, during which time they’ve gone through five prime ministers and virtually every possible iteration of conservatism imaginable. And after 13 years in power, it’s fair to say the party looks a little tired and out of ideas.

This is why Sunak is leaning into the Conservatives’ historical trump card issue: immigration.

Sunak, himself the son of immigrants, is currently throwing absolutely everything he has at trying to bring down the UK’s net migration numbers – which reached a record high of 745,000 in 2022.

That high number exists for various reasons: The UK has had generous policies to welcome people fleeing Ukraine and Hong Kong in recent years.

Since leaving the European Union, the UK is no longer part of the Dublin Regulation, an EU law that is designed to share the burden of hosting asylum seekers across the bloc by allowing member states to return migrants to the EU country they first entered – something the UK used effectively and benefited from.

The implications of this can be seen most clearly in the number of people now crossing the English Channel in small boats.

The boats are largely run by criminal trafficking gangs who help migrants illegally enter the UK in unsafe, crowded vessels that have on multiple occasions led to people drowning.

While these small boats are not the chief reason for the UK’s immigration numbers, they arguably have the highest profile.

In 2018 , the number of people detected crossing the English Channel in small boats was 299, according to Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. In 2022, that number was 45,755.

Of course, 45,755 is a fraction of the 745,000 net immigration total. However, for the places that are most affected by these small boat landings, that enormous increase is very visible. For the people who live in areas where these migrants end up being housed while their asylum claims are processed, it is impossible not to notice the influx into local populations.

Politically, small boat crossings have become a touchstone issue for the next election – hence Sunak making stopping the boats one of his five key priorities at the start of this year.

He has inherited a controversial plan from his predecessors whereby the UK reached an agreement with Rwanda that refugees could be sent to that country instead of staying in the UK. To date, the UK has not sent a single person to Rwanda because courts have prevented them from doing so. Most notably, the European Court of Human Rights has blocked flights to Rwanda from taking off. In short, there are human rights concerns that people who are sent to Rwanda could still face oppression in Rwanda or be sent back to their country of origin.

Sunak this week unveiled a bill that was designed to block any legal reason that planes were not flying people to Rwanda. His immigration minister resigned hours later and it is possible that his government will lose a vote on the bill in parliament next week. Meanwhile it was revealed that the British government had paid the Rwandan government an additional £100m this year as part of the deal. It had already sent £140m to the country.

For a country that in 2016 voted to leave the European Union, a foreign court interfering with domestic law is something that creates political opportunities. Enter Nigel Farage.

Farage, one of the most high-profile Brexit campaigners, has been using his media profile and daily TV show to talk about small boats for a long time.

His tactic of attacking Sunak and the Conservatives from the right has over time forced some on the right of the Conservative Party to call for increasingly tough action on immigration. Some even think there is an argument for the UK leaving the ECHR. And with an election coming up, some are even wondering if promising some kind of referendum on the UK’s membership of the ECHR in the Conservative manifesto might be a way of keeping voters who are tempted to cast their ballots for smaller right-wing parties.

Indeed, Sunak’s recently-sacked home secretary said in a statement to parliament earlier this week: “The powers to detain and remove must be exercisable notwithstanding the Human Rights Act, the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention, and all other international law … it is now or never. The Conservative Party faces electoral oblivion in a matter of months if we introduce yet another Bill destined to fail. Do we fight for sovereignty or let our party die?”

If this all sounds familiar, that’s because it’s all happened before. It was Farage’s Euroskeptic rabble-rousing that forced former Conservative leader David Cameron to put a Brexit vote in his party’s 2015 manifesto. Cameron won that election, but was forced to resign a year later after losing the referendum. Sunak can at least ask Cameron for advice, having recently made him the UK’s foreign secretary.

While Cameron has been publicly supportive of Sunak’s Rwanda plan and the bill introduced this week, it’s not hard to imagine him telling his boss that on Europe and immigration, the Conservatives simply cannot win.

The reality is that the bar set by Farage and some of his own MPs is so high that there is no way Sunak can clear it. Whatever he does, it will never be enough for the voters most-motivated by migration.

On the left – which in modern British politics can at times really mean center-right – Sunak risks looking cruel, kicking down at people who are fleeing war zones and trying to send them to a place where they are still not safe.

Sunak is desperate to flip the debate over to Labour, forcing them to take a position on immigration – but this issue is intensely toxic for Conservatives. There will always be people with the luxury of sitting outside of mainstream politics who can make noise.

And beside all of this, British attitudes to migration have evolved in the past few years – the idea of simply being strong on immigration winning votes for the Conservatives is not as true as it once was.

Some who saw it as a key issue now recognize that the health service benefited from migrant labor. Some feel post-Brexit that their concerns were addressed and that the country now has control over immigration. There are still people who care a lot about migration, of course, but the general direction of travel is that views are softening.

Given the difficult position he’s in, it’s no surprise that Sunak is looking for wedge issues ahead of the next election. But it might be that the PM has picked a fight he simply can’t win.","['rishi', 'rwanda', 'fight', 'immigration', 'party', 'sunak', 'picking', 'week', 'migration', 'small', 'conservatives', 'uk', 'boats', 'issue', 'probably', 'win', 'sent']","The implications of this can be seen most clearly in the number of people now crossing the English Channel in small boats.

18,Bear attacks in Japan are at a record high. Climate change and an aging population are making the problem worse,"Tokyo CNN —

Seishi Sato had an ominous feeling when he saw something rustling in a bush during a recent stroll in a forest in northern Japan.

Before he knew it, two Asiatic bears had sprung from the shrub, one charging at him as he frantically tried to fend it off while fearing for his life.

“When I saw them, I was so close and I thought I was in deep trouble,” the 57-year-old from Iwate prefecture, in northeast Japan, told CNN.

He survived the attack — but not without plenty of scratches and puncture wounds on his arm and thigh.

Sato is among at least 212 people who survived what has been a record year for bear attacks in Japan, according to the Ministry of Environment. Six people have died.

With a month of 2023 still to go, this year’s total has already far surpassed the 158 that took place throughout the whole of 2020 (the previous record year). And the number of bear attacks have never exceeded 200 per year since record began in 2006.

Sightings of “kuma”, or bears, are not unusual in Japan but are generally concentrated in the northern part of the country, where mountain ranges, lush bush and crystal-clear rivers provide an ideal habitat and abundant sources of the acorns, beechnuts, fruits and insects that make up their diet.

But experts say Japan’s bears are increasingly venturing out of their traditional habitats and into urban areas in search of food. Some suggest this is because climate change is interfering with the flowering and pollination of some of the animals’ traditional sources of food.

“Bears are expanding their home range this year and are coming down to areas near human settlements in search of food,” said associate professor Maki Yamamoto, who studies bears at the Nagaoka University of Technology in Niigata.

Increasingly, this is bringing them into the paths of people like Sato, who was attacked just a half-hour walk from the shop he runs, where he sells pet supplies and mushrooms he picks from the forest.

“People are becoming very alert to this situation,” said Sato, adding that other residents had been attacked outside the front doors of their village homes.

As of November, there had been 19,191 sightings across the country, up from 11,135 sightings throughout the whole of the previous year and 12,743 in 2021.

Iwate, where Sato lives, has logged more cases than anywhere else - 5,158 – followed by its neighboring prefecture of Akita, which has reported 3,000 sightings.

So pressing has the issue become that Environment Minister Shintaro Ito pledged last month to help affected communities.

“We are considering providing emergency assistance to local communities in response to their needs, such as surveying and capturing bears living in the vicinity of human settlements, taking into consideration the wishes of prefectures where human casualties due to bears are particularly on the rise,” he told a press conference.

Protective mama bears

Japan is home to two main types of bear: brown bears, which live in Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan’s main islands, and a small population of Asiatic bears, which reside in Honshu, Japan’s largest island.

Both breeds have an omnivorous diet, enjoy feeding on acorns and tend to avoid humans if possible. An Asiatic bear weighs between 40 and 100 kg while a Japanese brown bear can grow up to 400kg. But both are far from being the biggest bear on earth. Kodiak Brown Bears in Alaska, for example, can weigh up to 600kg.

“Both brown bears and Asiatic black bears are basically timid animals that avoid people,” said Professor Koji Yamazaki from the Tokyo University of Agriculture.

When bears do attack, the cause is usually because a mother bear fears an encounter with a human poses a threat to her cub, experts said.

Sato, who runs the YouTube channel Primitive Forest Bear to share his adventures in nature, recalled that the Asiatic bears he ran into appeared to be mother and child.

He captured the attack on camera and posted the video online as a reminder to others to take care.

The video, which has since gone viral, shows him screaming for his life and hitting the animal with a tree branch to drive it away. At one point, he climbs a tree to avoid being mauled. Luckily, the bear eventually turns away.

“When I saw the video, I was scared to death,” Sato said.

Climate change and population shifts

With encounters on the increase, some experts believe climate change may be a factor in pushing bears further from their traditional habitats.

“The thing is that you can have years of bad harvests and years of good harvest of acorns. And when the harvest is bad, the bears cannot store enough energy before hibernation by eating mountain acorns alone, so they get closer to human settlements looking for fruits, chestnuts, persimmons, walnuts, and farm products in general,” Yamamoto, from Nagaoka University of Technology, explained.

“This year, bears have been appearing more in the villages precisely because of the very bad harvest of acorns from the beech, the bears’ favorite tree,” she said.

Tsutomu Mano, a senior research fellow at the Hokkaido Research Organization, said climate change “is likely to have a significant impact on the flowering time of plants and the activity of insects responsible for pollination, which is necessary for fruiting.”

And when the bears don’t have enough food, they often turn to human neighborhoods to look for leftovers in the bins, he said.

Once they’ve developed a taste for human leftovers they will keep returning for more, Mano said.

Another factor that some believe may be coming into play is Japan’s rapidly shifting demographics.

With a median age of 48, Japan has one of the world’s oldest populations, according to the Economic and Social for Asia and the Pacific, a United Nations’ arm that tracks population trends.

At the same time, the country is experiencing a shift in which younger generations are increasingly moving to big cities for better job opportunities.

Taken together, the two factors mean populations on the rural edges of northern prefectures are fast dwindling, creating conditions such as “abandonment of cultivated land and overgrowth along riversides” that “make it easier for bears to enter,” according to Mano.

According to national broadcaster NHK, out of the 71 people attacked by bears in October, 61 were above the age of 60. Twenty-one people were in their 80s.

On October 24 alone, four people – all in the 70s – were injured in Akita on the same day, the broadcaster reported.

What’s the solution?

At Karuizawa, a resort town located in Nagano prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, conservationists have taken to patrolling the forest with dogs to scare the bears away, according to local media.

But officials in Akita prefecture, which recorded the second-highest number of bear attacks, have a more drastic measure in store. They have begun offering rewards to trappers.

Governor Norihisa Satake announced late last month a 5,000-yen ($33) prize for each bear captured in the prefecture. The authorities are also mulling a proposal to set aside a fund of up to 15 million yen ($100,000) to pay for the transportation of the captured bears.

But experts say a more holistic approach is needed.

“Trapping is not sufficient to manage bears, so it is necessary to consider a combination of various methods,” said Yamazaki, from the Tokyo University of Agriculture.

The first step was to study what types of bear – in terms of their ages, genders and locations - were going astray and why, he said.","['record', 'sato', 'brown', 'making', 'climate', 'japan', 'population', 'problem', 'high', 'bear', 'bears', 'asiatic', 'university', 'change', 'prefecture', 'human', 'worse', 'acorns']","Before he knew it, two Asiatic bears had sprung from the shrub, one charging at him as he frantically tried to fend it off while fearing for his life.

Crumbley pleaded guilty last year to one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of first-degree murder and 19 other charges related to the deadly shooting at Oxford High School in 2021.

McDonald said she spoke to the school shooting victims after the trial and said that no one is celebrating Friday’s sentencing.

She said while Crumbley’s remarks to the court ahead of the sentencing weren’t “going to bring peace” to the hundreds of people in the case, her team is glad they got the results they wanted.

20,Six French teenagers convicted in connection with 2020 beheading of teacher Paty,"CNN —

A French court on Friday convicted six teenagers in connection with the 2020 beheading of history teacher Samuel Paty, whose murder shocked the country.

The teacher had shown his pupils caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression, angering some Muslim parents. Most Muslims avoid depictions of prophets, considering them to be blasphemous.

Among those on trial was a teenage girl who had allegedly told her parents that Paty had asked Muslim pupils to leave the room before showing the caricatures.

The court found her guilty of having made false accusation charges and slanderous comments, as it was established that she was not in the class at the time.

The other adolescents were found guilty of charges related to taking part in a pre-meditated criminal conspiracy and helping to prepare an ambush.

Paty, 47, was killed outside his school in a Paris suburb by an 18-year-old assailant of Chechen origin, who was shot dead by police soon after the attack.

The court found those adolescents guilty of having pointed out Paty to the murderer.

Louis Cailliez, lawyer for Paty’s sister Mickaelle, told reporters his client was “satisfied with the full conviction,” but less so with the sentences, that she found “too lenient”.

Dylan Slama, a lawyer for one of the teenagers, said that though it was hard to talk about satisfaction in such tragic circumstances, there was a sense of relief for his client.

The heaviest sentence was given to an adolescent who was formally given a 6-month prison sentence, although he should be able to serve this at home while under electronic surveillance.

The girl who was found guilty of making false accusations and slanderous comments was given an 18-month suspended sentence and put on probation measures for two years.

21,Appeals court maintains most of Trump gag order in federal election subversion case,"CNN —

An appeals court has largely upheld the gag order against former President Donald Trump in the federal election subversion case, saying he can be barred from talking about witnesses as well as prosecutors, the court staff and their family members.

But the court said the gag order does not apply to comments made about special counsel Jack Smith and narrows the prohibition Trump had for speaking about witnesses in the case, a change from the original gag order.

The decision against Trump is a striking admonishment for an ex-president facing an upcoming criminal trial, but also makes clear Trump is still allowed to criticize President Joe Biden and the Justice Department and to argue the prosecution “is politically motivated or that he is innocent of the charges against him.”

The three appeals court judges who issued Friday’s ruling — Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard and Bradley Garcia, all Democratic appointees — found Trump’s words on the public stage could undermine the fairness of a jury trial, sway or intimidate witnesses and imperil court staff. The court said that justifies limiting Trump’s speech, even while he campaigns to return to the presidency.

It is the second time in recent weeks that an appeals court has reinstated limits on what Trump can say publicly. Trump’s also under a gag order in New York barring him from attacking court staff in a civil fraud trial against him and his business there. Trump is set to testify in that case on Monday.

Trump vowed to appeal the decision in a social media post on Friday.

Friday’s lengthy opinion came from all three judges who heard Trump’s appeal at the DC Circuit Court nearly two weeks ago, and was written by Millett.

“Mr. Trump’s documented pattern of speech and its demonstrated real-time, real-world consequences pose a significant and imminent threat to the functioning of the criminal trial process in this case,” the appeals court wrote.

The court said that Trump’s campaign for the 2024 presidency “does not alter the court’s historical commitment or obligation to ensure the fair administration of justice in criminal cases.”

“We do not allow such an order lightly. Mr. Trump is a former President and current candidate for the presidency, and there is a strong public interest in what he has to say,” the court said.

“But Mr. Trump is also an indicted criminal defendant, and he must stand trial in a courtroom under the same procedures that govern all other criminal defendants. That is what the rule of law means.”

Court cites Trump’s attacks on Meadows and Pence

In explaining their decision, the appeals court pointed to the former president’s many public statements and attacks against witnesses in the case, including former chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Vice President Mike Pence.

The court said that such statements “pose a significant” risk that witnesses would be intimidated and “unduly influenced” in the case. Some witnesses have “had their lives turned upside down after coming within Mr. Trump’s verbal sights,” the court wrote.

The court also noted that Trump is subject to release conditions barring him from direct communication with witnesses.

That prohibition “would mean little if he can evade it by making the same statements to a crowd, knowing or expecting that a witness will get the message,” the court wrote.

The risk to witnesses “is largely irreversible in the age of the Internet,” the court noted. “Once an individual is publicly targeted, even revoking the offending statement may not abate the subsequent threats, harassment, or other intimidating effects during the pretrial as well as trial stages of this case.”

The court also noted Trump’s public statement shortly after being charged in the case, “If go after me, I’m coming after you,” as a broadly threatening message toward people working on the case, and said his “messaging [was] daggered at likely witnesses and their testimony.”

Trump is still able to publicly share opinions about witnesses who include several high-profile critics of his who served in his presidential administration.

Trial delay would ‘simply compound the problem’

In the ruling Friday, the appeals court pushed back forcefully against Trump’s argument that his criminal trial should be delayed until after the 2024 presidential election as an alternative to limiting his speech, writing that it would be “counterproductive, create perverse incentives, and unreasonably burden the judicial process.”

Trump has repeatedly argued in court that his criminal trial in the election interference case, which is scheduled for March, should be delayed until after the November presidential election. So far, all of his efforts have been rejected.

“Allowing prejudicial statements to go unchecked for an even longer pre-trial period would simply compound the problem,” the appeals court wrote.

The court also said that allowing the former president’s threatening speech to “override the district court’s control and management of the trial schedule” would incentivize other criminal defendants to also say or post harmful things as a means of delaying their own prosecutions.

The gag order doesn’t prohibit Trump from making any comments but rather statements “made with the intent to materially interfere” with the case. For instance, Trump can publicly speak about witnesses, the appeals court said, but not about their “potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding.”

The appeals court said his words about possible witnesses would have to be looked at in context.

“That allows the former President to continue to speak out about those same persons’ books, articles, editorials, interviews, or political campaigns as long as he does so in a manner that does not concern their roles as witnesses or the content of any expected testimony,” the court wrote.

In addition, the court strongly backed his ability to disparage the special counsel.

“As a high-ranking government official who exercises ultimate control over the conduct of this prosecution, the Special Counsel is no more entitled to protection from lawful public criticism than is the institution he represents,” the court wrote.

22,"Ryan O’Neal, star of ‘Love Story’ and ‘Peyton Place,’ dead","CNN —

Oscar-nominated actor Ryan O’Neal, star of several landmark films including “Love Story” and “Paper Moon,” has died, according to his son, Patrick, who posted the news to social media. He was reportedly 82.

“My dad passed away peacefully today, with his loving team by his side supporting him and loving him as he would us,” Patrick O’Neal wrote on Friday.

He added: “My father Ryan O’Neal has always been my hero. I looked up to him and he was always bigger than life.”

CNN has reached out to a representative for Ryan O’Neal.

Ryan O’Neal’s breakout role came in 1964 on the nighttime soap opera “Peyton Place.”

A Hollywood “Love Story”

After starring in several TV shows throughout the 1960s, O’Neal made an indelible mark on the movies in the 1970 adaptation of the Erich Segal novel “Love Story,” in which he starred opposite Ali MacGraw. The tearjerker film told the story of a wealthy Ivy Leaguer (Ryan O’Neal) who marries an outspoken and irreverent girl (MacGraw), only to watch her die of a terminal illness. Among other things, it popularized the line, “Love means never having to say you’re sorry.”

The film was a huge hit, providing a major boost to Paramount Pictures (which was being run by MacGraw’s then-husband, Robert Evans), and while it established Ryan O’Neal as a classic leading man – and earned him an Oscar nomination in the process – he also found success in comedy, playing opposite Barbra Streisand in “What’s Up, Doc?” and “The Main Event.”

On X (formerly Twitter), Streisand said she was “sad” to hear the news of the actor’s death.

“He was funny and charming, and he will be remembered,” she wrote.

Ryan O’Neal later starred in a “Love Story” sequel called “Oliver’s Story,” which flopped at the box office.

The actor’s eclectic resume included starring with his daughter, Tatum O’Neal, in “Paper Moon,” for which she won an Academy Award for best supporting actress; and the Stanley Kubrick-directed period piece “Barry Lyndon.”

Off screen, O’Neal had a long relationship with actress and pin-up model Farrah Fawcett, which provided endless fodder for the tabloids. The relationship followed earlier marriages to actresses Joanna Moore and Leigh Taylor-Young.

Born in Los Angeles, O’Neal trained to become a professional boxer before he began to pursue acting, appearing in several TV westerns, and eventually landing his regular role on “Peyton Place.”

O’Neal’s more recent credits included recurring roles on the TV shows “Bones” and “Bull,” along with appearances on “Desperate Housewives” and the reboot “90210.”

Strained relationship

Ryan O’Neal and his daughter Tatum O’Neal’s off-screen relationship was strained for many years.

She had struggled with addiction, and in 2011, the father and daughter starred in the reality series “Ryan and Tatum: The O’Neals” on OWN.

A clip of that show was featured that year during a Tatum O’Neal appearance on CNN.

“How would I feel if my father were to, say, get sick or die even? Would I be OK? And I realized that I wouldn’t be OK,” she said in the clip. “So I knew I needed to make an effort, because what is your life without your family? What’s your life without a father?”

In 2020, Tatum O’Neal’s son shared on social media that the family had reconciled.

The actor had four children. In addition to Tatum O’Neal, he had a son, Griffin O’Neal, with Moore. He also had a son, Redmond James O’Neal, with Fawcett. Patrick O’Neal, a sportscaster, was from his marriage with Taylor-Young.

24,European Union agrees to regulate AI development,"CNN —

European Union lawmakers struck a deal Friday agreeing to one of the world’s first major comprehensive artificial intelligence laws.

The landmark legislation, called the AI Act, sets up a regulatory framework to promote the development of AI while addressing the risks associated with the rapidly evolving technology. The legislation bans harmful AI practices “considered to be a clear threat to people’s safety, livelihoods and rights.”

The law comes amid growing fears about the disruptive capabilities of artificial intelligence.

In a news conference, Roberta Metsola, the president of the European Parliament, called the law “a balanced and human-centered approach” that will “no doubt be setting the global standard for years to come.”

The regulatory framework, which classifies AI uses by risk and increases regulation on higher risk levels, was first proposed in 2021.

The riskiest uses for AI are banned. According to the law, those include systems that exploit specific vulnerable groups, biometric identification systems for law enforcement purposes and artificial intelligence that deploys manipulative “subliminal techniques.”

Limited risk systems, such as chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, or technology that generates images, audio or video content, are subject to new transparency obligations under the law.

“The #AIAct is much more than a rulebook – it’s a launchpad for EU startups and researchers to lead the global AI race,” Thierry Breton, the EU Commissioner for Internal Market, wrote on social media. “The best is yet to come.”

Artificial intelligence broke into the mainstream with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. Seemingly overnight, generative AI technology exploded in popularity and spurred an AI arms race.

But AI’s disruption reaches far beyond the world of big tech: Educators have struggled with generative AI’s ability to complete schoolwork assignments; artists and musicians have grappled with the potential for AI-fueled imitation; and even the media industry has seen its controversies.

Some of the companies behind the technology have experienced growing pains, as well.

OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, was briefly ousted and then reinstated over the course of a few drama-filled days in November – with the exact reasons for the leadership changes still unclear, weeks later.

25,Tomato lost in space by history-making astronaut has been found,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Perhaps nowhere in the universe is a fresh, ripe tomato more valuable than on the International Space Station, where astronauts live for months at a time subsisting mainly on prepackaged, shelf-stable goods.

That’s why astronaut Frank Rubio became the central figure in a lighthearted whodunnit that has taken months to solve.

After Rubio harvested one of the first tomatoes ever grown in space earlier this year, according to the astronaut, he admitted he misplaced it.

“I put it in a little bag, and one of my crewmates was doing a (public) event with some schoolkids, and I thought it’d be kind of cool to show the kids — ‘Hey guys this is the first tomato harvested in space,’” Rubio said during an October media event. “I was pretty confident that I Velcroed it where I was supposed to Velcro it … and then I came back and it was gone.”

In the microgravity environment of space, anything not anchored to a wall is at risk of floating away — destined to spend eternity hidden behind a nook or cranny within the football field-size orbiting laboratory and its labyrinthian passageways.

Rubio said he probably spent eight to 20 hours of his own free time just searching for that tomato.

“Unfortunately — because that’s just human nature — a lot of people are like, ‘He probably ate the tomato,’” Rubio said. “And I wanted to find it mostly so I could prove like I did not eat the tomato.”

But he never found it.

Rubio returned to Earth on September 27 with the precious produce still lost aboard the space station.

It remained lost — until now.

During a Wednesday news conference, members of the seven-person crew remaining on the space station revealed they had finally located the tomato.

Rubio had “been blamed for quite a while for eating the tomato,” NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli said. “But we can exonerate him.”

Tomato on top of a historic mission

The astronauts did not reveal where the tomato was or specify what state the produce was in when found.

Rubio surmised in October that it had probably already shriveled into an unrecognizable rot.

Due to the humidity at the space station, “it probably desiccated to the point where you couldn’t tell what it was,” Rubio said.

Case closed.

Rubio’s return to Earth in September was a historic moment. His stay on the space station — which lasted more than a year — set a record for the longest a US astronaut has ever spent in microgravity.

Rubio originally expected to spend only six months aboard the International Space Station. Instead, he logged 371 days following the discovery of a coolant leak coming from his original ride — a Russian Soyuz spacecraft — while it was docked to the orbiting outpost.

In his October interview, Rubio acknowledged how arduous moments of the journey were.

“I kind of allowed myself a day to feel sad and sorry for myself, and then I try to really make a conscious decision to say OK let’s have a good attitude and let’s just try to do the best job possible,” Rubio said of learning his stay would be extended by another six months.

26,"Three dead in outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, CDC warns","CNN —

An outbreak of the tickborne disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever has caused at least five illnesses, including three deaths, in the US since July, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Friday.

The five cases were identified in Southern California and involved people who had traveled to Tecate, Baja California, in the previous two weeks. Four were under age 18, and three were US residents, the agency said in a health alert. All five were hospitalized, and three died.

The CDC is warning health care providers that if a patient has symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and has recently traveled to northern Mexico, they should consider starting treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline right away, rather than waiting for test results to confirm the condition.

“RMSF is a severe, rapidly progressive, and often deadly disease transmitted by the bite of infected ticks, although many patients do not recall being bitten by a tick,” the agency notes. It’s endemic in northern Mexico and in parts of the southwestern US, where it can be transmitted by brown dog ticks. It does not spread from person to person.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Signs of infection can be mild in the first few days, including a low fever, headache, stomach problems, abdominal pain, rash and swelling around the eyes and on the back of the hands. On or after about five days, someone may develop changes in mental state, coma, brain swelling, respiratory problems and multiorgan damage. It’s fatal in 5% to 10% of cases, with about half of those deaths happening within eight days of the onset of illness.

Anyone who’s traveled to northern Mexico and develops symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever within two weeks of their return to the US should get medical attention right away, the CDC says. Protect against tick bites by treating pet dogs, using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing when outdoors. Check yourself and children for ticks after spending time outdoors or around dogs, and immediately remove any ticks you find.","['mountain', 'outbreak', 'rocky', 'cdc', 'northern', 'traveled', 'fever', 'ticks', 'mexico', 'dead', 'health', 'spotted', 'warns', 'disease']","CNN —An outbreak of the tickborne disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever has caused at least five illnesses, including three deaths, in the US since July, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Friday.

27,Billionaire Ken Langone is latest GOP megadonor to endorse Nikki Haley,"CNN —

Billionaire Ken Langone on Friday endorsed Nikki Haley’s presidential bid in the latest sign of the Republican moneyed class rallying behind her as the main alternative to Donald Trump in the GOP primary.

“I think she is just what we need right now. I think her approach is smart. I think she’s qualified,” Langone said on Fox News. “More importantly, I think the American people need this kind of leadership – statesmanlike, elegant. Just think of … where we have been in the last six or seven or eight years. It is not good at all.”

Langone, a co-founder of Home Depot, is the latest in a growing list of wealthy donors to back the former South Carolina governor. The network associated with billionaire Charles Koch announced its support for her last week, as did North Carolina retail magnate Art Pope. Earlier this week, LinkedIn co-founder and billionaire Democratic donor Reid Hoffman gave $250,000 to support her campaign.

Langone said that while he likes GOP contender Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor’s “numbers aren’t moving.”

“The writing is on the wall,” Langone told Fox News. “On the other hand, Nikki Haley has had a substantial upswing. The one thing I’m committed to is we have to beat Joe Biden. If Joe Biden is going to be the nominee, we have to beat him. We can’t take any more of this mayhem.”

Asked why he didn’t endorse Trump, Langone said the former president’s time has “come and gone” and condemned his actions toward the end of his White House tenure.

“What Trump put this country through the last three months of his presidency was disgraceful,” Langone said.

“I think what happened on January 6 – all he had to say is ‘Please go home.’ … But he sat in a room and watched it for three hours and did nothing about it and America deserves better than that,” he added.","['joe', 'endorse', 'megadonor', 'think', 'gop', 'support', 'trump', 'week', 'nikki', 'haley', 'langone', 'latest', 'need', 'billionaire', 'ken']","CNN —Billionaire Ken Langone on Friday endorsed Nikki Haley’s presidential bid in the latest sign of the Republican moneyed class rallying behind her as the main alternative to Donald Trump in the GOP primary.

28,Beyoncé and Taylor Swift have never had the rivalry many try to suggest,"CNN —

Beyoncé vs Taylor Swift is less about them than it is about a larger discussion about erasure and ethnicity.

Both women have been successful performers for decades, endorsing each other’s artistry along the way. But many of their supporters and cultural critics continue to compare their careers, along with how their work is received and acknowledged.

The latest example was the reception this week to Swift being named Time’s 2023 Person of the Year. New York Times bestselling author and cultural critic Luvvie Ajayi Jones noted Beyoncé’s omission from the list of individuals considered.

“Taylor being TIME person of the year while Beyoncé was not even nominated when they had VERY comparable years in terms quantifiable impact is actually wild,” Ajayi Jones wrote on Instagram.

“They both had record-breaking sold out world tours and BOTH shifted economies ad BOTH had documentaries come out,” she continued. “ONE of them was crowned the PERSON OF THE YEAR. While the other was not even considered for the title.”

Swift’s “Eras Tour” reportedly grossed more than an estimated $1 billion, while Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” tour reportedly grossed an estimated $570 million. However, she had 56 tour dates compared to Swift’s 146.

“Whether or not you are BeyHive [the term for her hardcore fans] or can’t stand her, you cannot deny the obvious erasure,” Ajayi Jones added. “Because there is only ONE main thing that makes her and Taylor different. You can be one of the most influential women in the world, and because you’re Black you can still be locked out.”

Other well known people, including journalist Cari Champion, responded with support in Ajayi Jones’ comments on the post.

“When tell you that YOU always have the time and you are ON TIME,” Champion remarked.

TV personality and author Nicole Waters commented, “She’s won everything and still can’t win. We thank God she doesn’t measure her worth by accolades issued by ‘not us.’ And that’s the lesson.”

For some, the selection of Swift is a continuation of the debate about industry disparities between Black and white artists and how their work is valued.

In 2017, there were accusations of racism after Adele topped Beyoncé in the album of the year category at the Grammy awards.

Yet the argument can be made that far from allowing issues of race to hold her back, Beyoncé has used it to fuel her art (see “Lemonade,” “Black Is King” and “Renaissance” for confirmation of that). It also bears mention that while she has not yet won an album of the year Grammy, Beyoncé holds the all-time record for most Grammy wins by a single artist with 32.

So while comparisons between the two artists may continue, the women themselves have only shown each other love.

Taylor Swift pushes back on comparing tours

In her interview with Time, Swift called out those who would position her in competition with Beyoncé.

“There were so many stadium tours this summer, but the only ones that were compared were me and Beyoncé,” Swift said. “Clearly it’s very lucrative for the media and stan culture to pit two women against each other, even when those two artists in question refuse to participate in that discussion.”

She also hailed Bey, saying “She’s the most precious gem of a person — warm and open and funny.”

“And she’s such a great disrupter of music-industry norms,” Swift said. “She taught every artist how to flip the table and challenge archaic business practices.”

Concert films

Both artists recently released films documenting their tours and attended the film premieres for the other.

In October, Swift gushed about Beyoncé showing up for the premiere for her “Eras Tour” concert film in Los Angeles.

“I’m so glad I’ll never know what my life would’ve been like without @beyonce’s influence. The way she’s taught me and every artist out here to break rules and defy industry norms,” Swift wrote in the caption of a video posted on social media showing the two of them inside of the theater. “Her generosity of spirit. Her resilience and versatility. She’s been a guiding light throughout my career and the fact that she showed up tonight was like an actual fairytale.”

Swift returned the gesture the following month, when Beyoncé’s film premiered in London.

Beyoncé literally gives Swift her flowers

In 2021, both women had a big night at the Grammys.

Swift won album of the year for “Folklore” and Beyoncé notched her 28th Grammy, becoming the most Grammy-winning female artist of all time.

The latter sent the former a beautiful bouquet of flowers with a note that read, “Congratulations on your Grammy. It was great seeing you on Sunday night. Thank you for always being so supportive. Sending love to you and your family. B.”

Swift shared a photo of the flowers and note on social media writing, “Woke up to flowers from the queen of grace & greatness @beyonce and suddenly it’s the best Friday EVER. Thank you B and congratulations on your epic achievement Sunday night!!”

Beyoncé shares the stage with Swift

Kanye West leaping on stage to hijack Swift’s win for best female video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards has gone down in pop culture history.

West grabbed the microphone and said, “Yo Taylor, I’m really happy for you. Imma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!”

The camera panned to Bey in the audience, looking flabbergasted.

Later, when Bey’s “Single Ladies” won for video of the year she brought Swift out to have the moment she had earlier been denied.

“I remember being 17 years old up for my first MTV Award with Destiny’s Child and it was one of the most exciting moments in my life,” Beyoncé said. “So I’d lke for Taylor to come out and have her moment.”

Afterwards Swift had nothing but praise for what she had done.

“They told me to stand by the side of the stage and I didn’t really know what was going to go down, but I thought it was so wonderful and gracious of her to do what she’s always done,” Rolling Stone reported Swift as saying at the time. “She’s always been a great person before anything else. Before the talented artist, the superstar, she’s always been a great person and I just, I thought I couldn’t love Beyoncé more tonight, then tonight happened and it was just wonderful.”

That love clearly couldn’t be more mutual.","['suggest', 'shes', 'artist', 'try', 'tour', 'women', 'taylor', 'beyoncé', 'grammy', 'won', 'person', 'swift', 'rivalry']","CNN —Beyoncé vs Taylor Swift is less about them than it is about a larger discussion about erasure and ethnicity.

29,Prevent injuries by avoiding these common exercise errors,"Editor’s note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.

CNN —

It’s a frustrating irony that exercise — so critical to good health and longevity — also has the potential to cause harm.

Some 3.6 million people were treated in emergency departments in 2022 for various injuries involving sports and recreational equipment, according to the National Safety Council. Topping the list? Injuries from exercise and exercise equipment, which accounted for 445,642 of those emergency department visits.

Whether you’re just starting out or rebooting a fitness routine, many injuries can be prevented with a little awareness and caution, according to experts.

“One of the biggest mistakes I see is doing too much, too soon,” said Dr. Alex McDonald, a family and sports medicine physician and assistant professor of clinical science at the Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine in Pasadena, California.

McDonald said such overexercising often occurs when someone decides to begin a new exercise regimen. “But they overestimate what they can do, then get injured or quit,” he said.

Exercising should be thought of as a long game, said Lisa Herrington, a certified personal trainer in Davis, California, and cofounder of Fit House Davis. “It should not be an all-or-nothing mentality,” she said. “A little every day goes a long way.”

Be mindful of form

Using proper form when exercising is also critical, whether you’re using a piece of gym equipment or engaging in activities such as running or cycling.

“Having good form always trumps speed, weight or strength,” McDonald said. “If you have bad form, you’re not getting the full benefit of the workout, and are potentially straining other muscles and ligaments that you’re not supposed to be using.”

One common example of bad form is hanging on, or leaning over, the handrails on treadmills and elliptical machines.

“People often hang on the handrails when they’re getting tired, instead of slowing down,” Herrington said. “But handrails are supposed to help with your workout, not be a rest aid. If you’re hanging on the equipment or leaning over the bars, back off the pace or incline.”

Herrington also frequently sees people leaning too hard on bike handlebars during the spin classes she teaches, which can result in sore necks and shoulders.

“People get tired during the sprints, so all of their body weight goes into the handlebars,” she said. “They should really take a seat for a few seconds and then sprint again.”

To ensure you’re using proper form, both McDonald and Herrington said it’s best to enlist the help of a professional, such as a personal trainer or physical therapist. They are the experts, plus it’s hard to evaluate yourself.

What’s more, you carry your body differently as you age. So even if your form was great several years ago, you may need some tweaks for the body you have today.

Cycling: Proper bike setup

Cycling may seem like a straightforward exercise, but it can cause injuries, too. A frequent misstep when cycling is having an incorrect seat height.

If your bike seat is too low or high, you may develop knee or lower-back pain, as your knee angle will be altered with each pedal stroke.

Your bike seat, or saddle, should be even with your hip bone when standing next to it.

When sitting on the bike and taking your feet off the pedals, your toes should be the only thing touching the floor.

Running: Don’t overdo it

Runners are at risk of goofs such as overstriding, poor gait and overtraining.

Overstriding, a common running error, occurs when you land with your foot too far in front of your hips or knees. Doing so puts you at risk for stress- and joint-related issues. Increasing your cadence, or the frequency of your steps, lowers the high impact of running, which may reduce injuries, according to a 2021 study. Greater step frequency also combats overstriding, as you have to take shorter steps.

To see if you may have gait issues, check the bottoms of your running shoes, McDonald said. If your heels or the outsides of your shoes are quite worn, it could indicate you’re landing too forcefully and frequently in less-optimal spots.

“A lot of running stores can video you running and do a gait analysis,” he said. “Physical therapists provide this service as well. Small tweaks in your gait can make a big difference when you’re talking about preventing a repetitive injury.”

Vary your movement

Overtraining involves performing the same motions over and over again, which can fatigue the body and make it susceptible to injury. Overtraining can also cause your fitness to plateau. So no matter your favorite activity, you should routinely mix things up.

“Try new machines at the gym,” Herrington said. “Take a group exercise class. Incorporate strength training exercises into cardiovascular routines.”

Developing a strong core is essential, too. “Core exercises strengthen the front and back of your body, improve your posture and help you move better,” she said.

Build your routine gradually

No matter what workout regimen you settle on, the key to staying healthy is to start slow and low. Increase the time or intensity of your workouts by just 10% per week, McDonald said, and never boost both the intensity and duration simultaneously.

Then, enjoy.

“The goal of regular exercise is to be able to move with comfort and ease for as long as we possibly can,” Herrington said. “Doing the right exercises for your body and mind, mixing up your routine every now and then, enlisting a professional when you need guidance, and choosing exercises that bring you joy are all important pieces to living a healthy life.”

30,"Teen tyrannosaur had a taste for baby dinos, rare fossil reveals","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Researchers have found a tyrannosaur’s last meal perfectly preserved inside its stomach cavity.

What was on the menu 75 million years ago? The hind legs of two baby dinosaurs, according to new research on the fossil published Friday in the journal Science Advances.

Dinosaur guts and hard evidence of their diets are rarely preserved in the fossil record, and it is the first time the stomach contents of a tyrannosaur have been uncovered.

The revelation makes this discovery particularly exciting, said co-lead author Darla Zelenitsky, a paleontologist and associate professor at the University of Calgary in Alberta.

“Tyrannosaurs are these large predatory species that roamed Alberta, and North America, during the late Cretaceous. These were the iconic apex or top predators that we’ve all seen in movies, books and museums. They walked on two legs (and) had very short arms,” Zelenitsky said.

“It was a cousin of T. rex, which came later in time, 68 to 66 million years ago. T. rex is the biggest of the tyrannosaurs, Gorgosaurus was a little bit smaller, maybe full grown would have been 9, 10 meters (33 feet).”

The tyrannosaur in question, a young Gorgosaurus libratus, would have weighed about 772 pounds (350 kilograms) — less than a horse — and reached 13 feet (4 meters) in length at the time of death.

The creature was between the ages of 5 and 7 and appeared to be picky in what it consumed, Zelenitsky said.

“Its last and second-to-last meal were these little birdlike dinosaurs, Citipes, and the tyrannosaur actually only ate the hind limbs of each of these prey items. There’s really no other skeletal remains of these predators within the stomach cavity. It’s just the hind legs.

“It must have killed … both of these Citipes at different times and then ripped off the hind legs and ate those and left the rest of the carcasses,” she added. “Obviously this teenager had an appetite for drumsticks.”

The two baby dinosaurs both belonged to the species called Citipes elegans and would have been younger than 1 year old when the tyrannosaur hunted them down, the researchers determined.

The almost complete skeleton was found in Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park in 2009.

That the tyrannosaur’s stomach contents were preserved wasn’t immediately obvious, but staff at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta, noticed small protruding bones when preparing the fossil in the lab and removed a rock within its rib cage to take a closer look.

“Lo and behold, the complete hind legs of two baby dinosaurs, both under a year old, were present in its stomach,” said co-lead author François Therrien, the museum’s curator of dinosaur paleoecology, in a statement.

The paleontologists were able to determine the ages of both the predator and its prey by analyzing thin slices sampled from the fossilized bones.

“There’s growth marks like the rings of a tree. And we can essentially tell how old a dinosaur is from looking at those, the structure of the bone,” Zelenitsky said.

Changing appetites of top predators

The fossil is the first hard evidence of a long-suspected dietary pattern among large predatory dinosaurs, said paleoecologist Kat Schroeder, a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University’s department of Earth and planetary science, who wasn’t involved in the research.

The teen tyrannosaur didn’t eat what its parents did. Paleontologists believe its diet would have changed over its life span.

“Large, robust tyrannosaurs like T. rex have bite forces strong enough to hit bone when eating, and so we know they bit into megaherbivores like Triceratops,” Schroeder said via email. “Juvenile tyrannosaurs can’t bite as deep, and therefore don’t leave such feeding traces.”

The red square highlights the location of the preserved gut contents in the Gorgosaurus libratus. Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology

She said that scientists have previously hypothesized that young tyrannosaurs had different diets from fully developed adults, but the fossil find marks the first time researchers have direct evidence.

“Combined with the relative rarity of juvenile tyrannosaur skeletons, this fossil is very significant,” Schroeder added. “Teeth can only tell us so much about the diet of extinct animals, so finding stomach contents is like picking up the proverbial ‘smoking gun.’”

The contents of the tyrannosaur’s stomach cavity revealed that at this stage in life, juveniles were hunting swift, small prey. It was likely because the predator’s body wasn’t yet well-suited for bigger prey, Zelenitsky said.

“It’s well known that tyrannosaurs changed a lot during growth, from slender forms to these robust, bone-crushing dinosaurs, and we know that this change was related to feeding behavior.”

When the dinosaur died, its mass was only 10% of that of an adult Gorgosaurus, she said.

How juvenile tyrannosaurs filled a niche

The voracious appetite of teenage tyrannosaurs and other carnivores has been thought to explain a puzzling feature of dinosaur diversity.

There are relatively few small and midsize dinosaurs in the fossil record, particularly in the Mid- to Late Cretaceous Period — something paleontologists have determined is due to the hunting activities of young tyrannosaurs.

32,Tesla failed at battery swapping but Stellantis says it may have the secret,"CNN —

It can take 20 minutes to “fast charge” an electric car up to 80%. But what if you could just change the batteries like they were AAs in a toy, and be back on the road fully charged in a handful of minutes?

It seems like an obvious solution, but there have been some famous failures with battery swapping. A decade ago, Tesla announced it would build out a network of battery swapping stations that could change out Model S’s battery pack in 90 seconds. But like many of CEO Elon Musk’s publicly-announced ideas, it was later dropped with Musk claiming customers weren’t interested.

And in 2013, an Israeli company that promised battery swapping called Better Place went out of business after burning through $850 million in cash and deploying only about 1,000 cars, according to reports at the time.

But the idea has become a reality, again, at least in Asia. Chinese EV maker Nio has been offering battery swapping for its vehicles since 2019. Nio now claims to be the world’s largest operator of battery swapping technology having performed over 32 million battery swaps since then at more than 2,100 stations.

Now Stellantis, the global automaker that makes Jeep, Dodge and Fiat vehicles, is also trying out the idea on a small scale – with a crucial difference – in hopes of incorporating it in future EV models.

Stellantis is working with a company called Ample that has created a new battery swapping system it says can work in virtually any shape or size of vehicle. It says the system doesn’t require any automaker to alter its vehicle to fit a special battery pack.

With Ample’s system, the entire battery pack – which can weigh more than 1,000 pounds – doesn’t get replaced as a single unit. Instead, a number of individually sealed battery modules about the size of a desktop computer are taken out by automated machinery and replaced one by one. In this way, all the vehicle’s batteries can be quickly replaced in easily manageable chunks rather than in a single huge slab.

That means it might take five to, at most, 10 minutes to change batteries, depending on the size of the vehicle and how many modules there are, instead of the 90 seconds Musk had promised. But having separate small battery packs provides numerous advantages.

First, the equipment required to change the batteries can be small. Ample’s battery swap stations, which handle the work automatically, look like backyard sheds with an extra-thick wall. The wall is where the battery modules are stored and charged. There’s no need to dig a hole in the ground underneath the battery swapping station, either, as might be the case if the equipment needed to handle entire big, heavy battery packs.

Because the batteries don’t need high-powered DC fast charging – they have plenty of time to charge inside the hut wall – the battery swapping stations don’t require the kind of high-wattage power connections fast-charging stations do. That simplifies their installation, said Khaled Hassounah, founder and chief executive of Ample.

Also, the vehicle itself can be of any shape or size. An SUV, car or truck doesn’t need to be designed around an Ample battery pack. The battery modules fit into a container on the underside of the vehicle where a battery pack would usually go. The container is adapted to the size and shape of the vehicle. A large vehicle could simply hold more battery modules while a smaller vehicle would hold fewer of them.

Besides Stellantis, Ample is also working with heavy equipment maker Mitsubishi Fuso on a battery-swapping test with commercial trucks in Japan. In the United States, the system is being tested with a variety of different Uber vehicles around the San Francisco Bay area. Ample’s 12 battery-swapping stations in the Bay area are used “a few hundred” times a day, according to the company.

The Ample battery modules can still be charged in the vehicle at a regular EV charger, so drivers would have the option of either plugging in or swapping batteries depending on the situation. As usual, most EV owners could still plug their cars in overnight at home.

Stellantis has not said it will necessarily incorporate the system into its EV models for sale around the world. Next year, Stellantis will use the Ample battery swap system in a fleet of 100 Fiat 500e electric cars in Spain that are part of the company’s Free2Move car-sharing service.

The Fiat 500e, a tiny electric car with a range of about 150 miles, provides a perfect test case for battery swapping, said Ricardo Stamatti-Avila, Stellantis’s vice president for charging and energy.

“If you want to extend the range of a car, the answer right now is you just throw more batteries at it,” he said. “But when you have limited real estate, like in a Fiat 500, that means we’d need to make the car bigger, and then it’s not a Fiat 500 anymore, right?”

Even with larger vehicles, Ample’s battery swapping system could free drivers from having to buy lots of extra battery power they might only rarely use, as they do now. Customers could just rent the extra battery packs they need for the occasional long trip, said Stamatti-Avila.

If the system works well in Spain, he said, Stellantis will look first to commercial fleet customers to start building up an infrastructure of swapping stations. Ordinary retail customers could start using the system once there are a good number of swapping stations available.

On the other hand, if Stellantis’s Spanish experiment doesn’t pan out, this whole battery-swapping thing might just never be talked about again, as happened with Tesla.","['batteries', 'system', 'failed', 'vehicle', 'stellantis', 'battery', 'modules', 'ample', 'size', 'stations', 'swapping', 'vehicles', 'secret', 'tesla']","It seems like an obvious solution, but there have been some famous failures with battery swapping.

33,"Could the most magical time of year be so full of loneliness, anger and stress?","Editor’s note: Dr. Neha Chaudhary is a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and chief medical officer at Modern Health.

CNN —

As the holiday season approaches, many conjure up images of the perfect gathering: comforting aromas of home-cooked feasts, harmonious laughter between friends and family, and thoughts of gratitude that easily roll off the tongue.

But for some people, this time of year feels like the exact opposite. It’s a time of stress, emotional turmoil or intense loneliness that looks nothing like the traditional celebration of togetherness.

Sixty-six percent of people report feeling lonely at the holidays, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, while 64% of people with mental illness say that the holidays make their condition worse. And as a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist, I see these issues firsthand all too often.

Why are loneliness and emotional distress so common this time of year? Some people may be living far from family or may not be able to afford to travel to see them. Others may be grieving the loss of loved ones or navigating strained relationships — and the holidays can serve as a rude reminder of those losses. And for some, the holiday season brings families together who would rather be apart. Whatever the cause, the impact of the holidays on our mental health can be profound.

If this sounds like you, you’re clearly not alone. And if your experience at this time of year is the exact opposite, remember that your friends, colleagues or strangers may be having a hard time at the holidays.

Understanding and navigating loneliness

While the holiday season is portrayed as a time for family and social gatherings, that expectation can inadvertently amplify feelings of isolation. That’s true not only for those who find themselves alone, but also for those who are surrounded by loved ones.

The problem is loneliness is killing us — literally. According to the US surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, loneliness is as bad for your health as is smoking every day. It can increase your risk of mental health conditions, stroke, heart disease and even premature death.

Fortunately, there are ways to tackle the feeling. If you’ve been feeling lonely this holiday season, the first thing you can do is recognize and name it. Let the feeling roll in as if it’s a fleeting moment that will pass. If you try to resist a feeling, usually it will push back, staying longer than its welcome. If you allow the feeling to float on through you, it can float away just as easily as it came.

Next, see if you can pinpoint the source of the feeling. Do the holidays remind you of the loss of a loved one, or are they connected to a negative experience from your childhood? Or is it that you find yourself comparing yourself with others, only to feel like you aren’t measuring up to your own expectations, set by social comparison?

Once you identify the trigger for the emotion, you can try to talk to yourself about it with compassion as if you would talk to a friend. Remind yourself that it’s OK to grieve. Tell yourself that comparison is a distraction and put aside your social media. Or remind yourself that you can make investments in relationships if you really want to — you do have some control.

Lastly, find ways for connection with others in the moment. Is there a friend you haven’t texted in a while? A group activity you could join that leaves you with a sense of community? If you don’t have existing connections to turn to, having a brief interaction with a stranger can work as well. Chat with someone outside of your home or better yet offer to help or give something to a stranger. The sense of connection it can foster may surprise you. And it’s good for your health.

Gratitude, reflection and … anger?

While the focus of this time of year tends to be around reflection and gratitude, for some people it brings on a completely different feeling: anger. Anger toward family members who, when brought together, bring unresolved tensions up to the surface as a group. Anger toward loved ones who bailed on them many years ago. Or anger about life not going according to plan.

Sound like you? If so, put aside your self-judgment and let yourself feel. And then do something about it. What are ways you can share your anger that are respectful and constructive? Is there a conversation you can have with a loved one to work through hurt feelings from the past? If that doesn’t feel doable, consider writing your feelings down in a letter that you may never give the other person. Sometimes the act of getting it out of your brain and down on paper can feel like a welcome release. You can tear up the letter and throw it in the trash or flush it down the toilet, picturing the anger leaving you as you destroy the letter itself.

Handling the stress and pressure

Navigating the expectations and pressures set by society (and yourself) around the holidays can be similar to walking a tightrope. Whether it’s the expertly roasted turkey or picture-perfect family gatherings, idealized holiday movie and social media images can create a sense of pressure that might overshadow the essence of gratitude and togetherness. Ultimately, these unrealistic standards often lead to unnecessary stress and a sense of inadequacy for many people.

To break yourself out of the trap of comparison and never-ending expectations, start by acknowledging that perfection is an elusive goal and not the point of the holidays. Embrace imperfections. Try out new rituals and routines that are relaxed, goofy and inconsistent year to year, just for the sake of having fun.

Set boundaries with family and friends who have high expectations of you, whether it’s your aunt’s commentary on what you should wear to dinner, your mother’s criticism of your cooking, or your father-in-law’s comments about how you should be spending more time with that side of the family than you are. Practice in advance what you’re going to say to people when they push your boundaries.

The holiday blues

This holiday season is going to be hard for a lot of people, for a lot of different reasons. If uncomfortable feelings arise for you this holiday, I encourage you to hold space for them.

If you’re feeling low, give yourself a pass and turn your focus to ways you can take care of yourself and your mental health, whether it’s curling up under a blanket and binge-watching movies, writing in a journal, listening to music, expressing yourself through art or calling an old friend. Recognize what you need to survive this moment. And if nothing else is working, turn to a professional for help.

For many people, it will be the most wonderful time of the year. For others, it won’t. The more we encourage a culture of empathy and understanding around all the emotions that come with the holidays, the more we can strengthen our communities and lift each other up when it matters. And this might be one of the times of year that it matters most.

34,"In Miami Beach, a new street art installation celebrates the city’s vibrant drag scene","CNN —

The newest work of public art in Miami Beach, Florida, is an ode to drag. On Tuesday, city officials unveiled “Adora Vanessa Athena Fantasia,” a vibrant series of aluminum panels suspended over a block of the bustling Española Way shopping district. Each panel features a kaleidoscopic portrait inspired by local drag queens (including the four who inspired its title: Adora, Athena Dion, Fantasia Royale and Tiffany Fantasia), and is accompanied by a 30-foot-tall mural of dramatic manicures, doll-like eyelashes and full, pouty lips.

These quintessential elements in the art of drag come together as “a costume, a work outfit and a kind of armor in one,” said Persephone Von Lips, one of eleven queens who inspired the installation. “The hair, the makeup, the nails, the whole getup — when I put them on, I can walk down any street and feel the most beautiful and most confident I’ve ever been.”

“Adora Vanessa Athena Fantasia” is a work by Assume Vivid Astro Focus, or AVAF, an artist collective known for its multidisciplinary installations and psychedelic explosions of color. The City of Miami Beach commissioned the piece as the latest installment of Elevate Española, a semi-annual public art project launched in 2021.

Eli Sudbrack, the Brazilian artist who founded AVAF in New York some 20 years ago, wanted to pay tribute to Miami Beach’s bustling drag scene. He was motivated in large part by a law that Florida governor and Republican presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis signed in April, which sought to limit drag performances in the state.

Named the “Protection of Children Act” by its sponsors, the law threatened venues that admitted children into “adult live performances” — a phrase widely understood to mean drag — with fines, misdemeanor charges or revoked liquor licenses. In June, a district judge temporarily blocked the law on grounds that it would “suppress the speech of drag queen performers,” and the US Supreme Court declined the state’s request for a partial stay in November. Still, attorneys for the DeSantis administration are seeking to overturn the law’s temporary block in federal appeals court.

""Energizing the viewer always seems to be the intention of drag performances and that is also an important feature in our work,"" explained AVAF's Eli Sudbrack in a statement. City of Miami Beach Communications Department

Across the US, where at least a dozen other states have attempted to pass similar laws, drag remains a central topic in a larger culture war targeting LGBTQ rights.

“There’s still a fear in the back of our heads: What are they going to do next?” said Von Lips. Historically, the drag community has given refuge to trans and queer people rejected by society or their families, she added, “and I just think it’s insane that people are trying to take that away from us.”

The spectacle of drag

After AVAF was chosen for the Elevate Española commission earlier this year, the New York-based Sudbrack began his research online, reaching out to Tiffany Fantasia, a veteran on the Miami drag scene, to learn more about the local community. The artist also asked a friend in Miami to send him a list of iconic performers from both the South Beach and Downtown Miami scenes, which ultimately included the aforementioned queens, as well as Karla Croqueta, Juice Love Dion, Lady Paraiso, Power Infiniti, Regina Black and TP Lords.

Looking to the queens’ Instagrams for reference, Sudbrack said, “I started making drawings out of details of their personas: (the) makeup, lipstick, wigs and nails, so that the central panels are a mixture of different drag queens put together as a super powerful image.” The composite portraits of each panel represent the overall community rather than individuals, energized by the psychedelic hues and patterns for which AVAF is known.

Sudbrack’s mural, meanwhile, used the colors of the Progress Pride flag as its palette. The piece zooms in on features of individual queens — the faces of Athena Dion and TP Lords; the manicured hands of Regina Black, for example — rendering them in a cartoonish style of graphic outlines.

“It was very important, if I’m going to do a project in Miami right now, to honor this practice, no matter what,” Sudbrack said. “Our own practice has always been about self-expression and freedom, and the artistry of drag is about that — to be whoever you want to be.”

Lissette Garcia Arrogante, director of tourism and culture for the City of Miami Beach, said AVAF was an ideal choice for the commission, citing “all the vibrancy and vitality of the colors in their work.”

“Miami Beach proudly stands as one of the world’s most welcoming LGBTQ destinations, where the drag scene thrives despite Florida’s misguided efforts,” added Miami Beach Commissioner Alex Fernandez, reflecting on the work’s content. “We emphatically ‘elevate’ and celebrate diversity, resisting any attempts to dim our community’s spirit.”

Despite the governor’s efforts, Tiffany Fantasia said she’s confident in her right to remain in drag. “Anything is possible with these extreme Republicans, but we all know at the end of the day, it is not constitutional for them to do this type of stuff,” she said. “It’s a violation of freedom of expression”

36,These ‘dome homes’ made from soil mix tradition and innovation,"CNN —

In Morocco, a startup is building affordable homes using a material that is ubiquitous: soil.

Eco-dôme Maroc was founded in 2016. It applies local traditions to modern technology to construct dome-shaped buildings that it says are cheaper, more environmentally sustainable and more energy-efficient than regular concrete homes.

Founder Youness Ouazri says he discovered “a very rich tradition of earthen construction” used by previous generations while he was traveling around the country.

“We simply took this existing know-how and adjusted it to modern technologies to come up with a concept that is eco-friendly, cost effective and very rapid to implement,” he tells CNN.

Each home Eco-dôme builds is unique. Once the company receives an order, the first step is to analyze the soil composition on site to determine its suitability for construction.

Small quantities of lime or cement can be added for optimal performance, and thermal simulation models are run to ascertain the ideal thickness of the dome’s walls, so that it can absorb heat during the summer and release it during the winter. That means the building will use as little energy as possible for heating and cooling — sometimes none at all, says Ouazri, who trained as a civil engineer.

He adds that the eco-domes are much faster to build than a standard home. Prices range from around 2,500 Moroccan dirhams ($247) per square meter to 4,500 dirhams ($445), and can vary according to the soil and site. Ouazri says that can be a third cheaper than a standard home “mainly because we eliminate a big part of the raw materials that we’d need to acquire, since we are using local soil. We also eliminate the logistics associated with that, such as transporting materials to the site.”

Eco-dôme builds the homes using different techniques. One is called “superadobe,” which was devised in the 1980s by Iranian American architect Nader Khalili, and uses stacked polypropylene bags filled with soil. Other methods include using a wooden frame for the structures to obtain a rectangular, rather than round, floorplan.

An Eco-dôme building in northern Morocco. Eco-dôme Maroc

The first Eco-dôme was completed in 2017. “It was a 775-square-feet house in a rural area near Rabat, the Moroccan capital, built for a client that uses it as a holiday house,” Ouazri says.

Since then, the company has built more than 100 domes across 40 different sites. The largest is a 2,700-square-foot cultural center in Agouim, 70 miles south-east of Marrakech, in an area with a harsh climate that swings from below freezing in winter to scorching hot in the summer.

‘Frugal innovation’

The company, which has received around $300,000 in investment to date and employs 17 people, has three main types of client, Ouazri says: “Land owners who want to build a primary or secondary home in the most ecological way possible; investors in rural tourism and eco-tourism; and local authorities and communities, to build schools or other infrastructure for education and healthcare.”

Eco-dôme now aims to start building in other countries and is looking at Tunisia and the Ivory Coast first.

Youssef El Ganadi, a professor of architecture at the International University of Rabat, who is not affiliated with Eco-dôme, says the project is an interesting “frugal innovation,” meant to make affordable homes for all social categories, and adds that it is sustainable.

However, he believes the uptake of the homes has been limited by a cultural barrier.

“Here in Morocco and in North Africa in general, many people have a mentality of wanting homes made of concrete, which they believe are more modern and robust,” he says. “That has limited the project to a niche, favored mainly by those with a certain sensibility to environmental causes and particularly for second homes.”

Ganadi also questions the earthquake resistance of superadobe domes. In September, Morocco was hit with a devastating quake that killed almost 3,000 people.

Ouzrai says attitudes are slowly changing. He adds that the Eco-dômes are built in compliance with local construction regulations, saying “buildings using superadobe or other earthen techniques are resilient to earthquakes” and that “four of our buildings were nearby the epicenter of the earthquake and stood still in front of it.”

“[Earth] lasts longer than industrialized materials,” Ouzrai says. “In certain regions in Morocco, we have buildings that were made thousands of years ago. With the appropriate maintenance, our domes can last forever.”

37,Pompeii archaeologists uncover bakery that doubled as prison,"Rome CNN —

An ancient bakery operated by slaves has been discovered in the ruins of Pompeii, the Pompeii Archaeological Park said in a statement released Friday.

Enslaved people and donkeys were locked up together and used to power a mill to grind grain for bread, according to details of the discovery provided by the park.

The site consists of a narrow room with no external view but only small, high windows covered by bars through which minimal light passed. There were also indentations in the floor “to coordinate the movement of the animals, forced to walk around for hours, blindfolded,” the statement said.

The discovery was made in the Regio IX section of the popular tourist site, which is also an ongoing archaeological dig. The area is currently being excavated as part of a larger project designed to secure and maintain previously excavated areas of the Roman city.

Archaeologists discovered the bakery while excavating an ancient Pompeiian home that was being renovated when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 C.E., covering the city of Pompeii with ash.

The bodies of three victims of the eruption were found in recent months, believed to be residents of the home rather than slaves. The house was divided into a residential section with “refined frescoes” on one side, and a commercial bakery on the other.

Next to the bakery was the dimly lit prison area, Pompeii Archaeological Park director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said in an interview posted on the site’s YouTube channel.

“What has emerged is testimony of the backbreaking work to which men, women, and animals were subjected in the ancient mill-bakeries,” he added.

Zuchtriegel said these prison bakeries were previously described by the Roman writer Apuleius in the 2nd century C.E., in his novel “Metamorphoses” (also known as “The Golden Ass”), in which the protagonist, Lucius, “transformed into a donkey and was sold to a miller.” Zuchtriegel said the episode was based on the writer’s direct knowledge of the animals and humans living and working together.

The prison area had no doors to the outside world. Parco Archeologico Di Pompei/Reuters

The newly discovered prison area had no doors to the outside, only to the inner atrium.

“It is, in other words, a space in which we must imagine the presence of people of servile status whose owner felt the need to limit the freedom of movement,” Zuchtriegel said.

“It is the most shocking side of ancient slavery, the side devoid of relationships of trust, where it was reduced to brute violence, an impression which is fully confirmed by the closing of the few windows with iron grates.”

Archaeologists also believe that the indentations in the slab flooring were not made by repetitive movement but were carved to prevent the donkeys and other animals from slipping on the pavement and to force them to only walk in a circular motion to grind the grain, almost like a clockwork mechanism.

“The iconographic and literary sources, in particular the reliefs from the tomb of Eurysaces in Rome, suggest that a millstone was normally moved by a couple made up of a donkey and a slave,” Zuchtriegel said.

“The latter, in addition to pushing the grindstone, had the task of encouraging the animal and monitoring the grinding process, adding grain and removing flour.”

The site will complement an exhibition that opens December 15, called “The Other Pompeii: common lives in the shadow of Vesuvius,” which is dedicated to what Zuchtriegel calls the “myriad of individuals often forgotten by historical chronicles, such as the slaves, who constituted the majority of the population and whose work contributed significantly to the economy, but also to the culture and social fabric of Roman civilization.”","['site', 'animals', 'area', 'prison', 'ancient', 'slaves', 'roman', 'archaeologists', 'uncover', 'zuchtriegel', 'pompeii', 'bakery', 'doubled']","Rome CNN —An ancient bakery operated by slaves has been discovered in the ruins of Pompeii, the Pompeii Archaeological Park said in a statement released Friday.

Read more opinion on CNN.

CNN —

In a court in Harris County, Texas, something remarkable happened this week: A woman and her husband asked a judge for an emergency order granting her permission to end a pregnancy.

Mary Zeigler Bill Lax/Bill Lax/FSU Photography Service

Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, had learned that the child she was carrying had full trisomy 18, a rare genetic condition that is almost always fatal. Her physicians have warned that continuing the pregnancy could put her at risk for life-threatening complications. Cox, who wants to have a third child, might also lose her ability to do so if forced to carry the pregnancy to term.

The judge granted Cox’s request on Thursday, but the state will almost certainly appeal to what is a Texas Supreme Court with nine Republican members. Late Friday, the Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocked the lower court’s ruling. But regardless of what happens next, Cox’s suit will shape the abortion debate going forward — not least because it is historic.

Cox is part of a new generation of plaintiffs telling heartbreaking stories about their experiences under criminal laws in places such as Texas, Idaho, Tennessee and Oklahoma — plaintiffs willing to speak out in a climate where support for abortion is at a record high, according to a WSJ-NORC poll, and some of the stigma surrounding abortion seems less intense. But given the popularity of abortion rights — and the obvious tragedy faced by women like Cox — why are states like Texas fighting so hard to defend their narrow exceptions?

The answer is that Cox’s case and others like it expose how unworkable abortion exceptions are under current law in states with virtual bans, especially when they are attached to harsh penalties like life in prison. Conceding that a woman like Cox is right could threaten to send much else about criminal abortion laws toppling down.

It is worth remarking on how rare Cox’s suit is. Before Roe v. Wade, patients and doctors both questioned the constitutionality of abortion laws. In some cases, pregnant patients were named plaintiffs: This was the case for Norma McCorvey, the “Roe” in Roe v. Wade, and Sandra Cano, the plaintiff in Roe’s companion case, Doe v. Bolton. These suits adjudicated whether a law was permissible, but often did not change what happened to a particular pregnant plaintiff (McCorvey, for example, famously carried what some called the “Roe baby” to term). After Roe, minors acting without parental consent or notification sought court-ordered abortion under what were called “judicial bypass” laws, often also while maintaining anonymity.

Cox’s case is quite different. She is an adult, not a minor, and she has not concealed her identity. Her willingness to tell her story is no doubt due to her own strength and commitment, but our present political moment likely has something to do with it too. Poll after poll find strong, if not unprecedented, support for legal abortion, even in states where abortion bans are already in effect. Backlash to these bans — and to the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization — has made it easier for other women to describe their own experiences with criminal laws and to file suits of their own.

McCorvey and Cano used pseudonyms at a time when pursuing abortion rights might have come at great personal and political cost. Women like Cox and Amanda Zurawski, who is challenging the validity of Texas’s medical emergency exception to abortion, use their own names, and do so with the knowledge that most Americans support legal abortion — and all the more so in cases like theirs.

When states fight plaintiffs like Cox and Zurawski in court, it hardly helps Republicans already on the defensive about abortion. It is comparably easy to paint bans as heartless and extreme when the state shows no sympathy for women who stand to lose their fertility, health or lives.

Suits like Cox’s expose how hard it would be to devise a workable abortion exception. In theory, a functioning exception would advance the state’s interest in fetal life while offering a real opportunity for people in exceptional cases that the state deems deserving. But if a state requires harsh punishment — Texas, for example, authorizes life in prison for abortion — few doctors will be willing to gamble that they are interpreting the law correctly, even if an exception is relatively clear.

Most exceptions, it turns out, aren’t clear anyway, written not by physicians but by lawmakers who use the language of criminal law, and sometimes write more than one exception into various criminal abortion laws, as in Oklahoma. The broader and more compassionate a state makes an exception, the higher the odds that more plaintiffs like Cox will prevail, but that will require deference to patients and physicians that anti-abortion states focused on punishing abortion providers reject as a matter of principle.

Exceptions almost always leave out other tragic circumstances. Texas has a medical emergency exception, but dismisses a fatal fetal abnormality that could deprive Cox of the ability to have a third child as nothing different than what is experienced by “countless women who give birth every day.” The risk of death, the state says, is simply “not imminent” enough. Andy Beshear, the Democratic governor of Kentucky, just made anger about a similar provision in his state’s law a central message of his successful reelection campaign.

Republican lawmakers often seem to want it both ways on abortion. They define themselves as pro-life but insist on compassion for women, especially in the so-called hard cases like Cox’s.

But what is happening in Texas complicates that narrative. Texas purports to value fetal life and women’s health — but then denies that the unborn have rights when that strategy will help defeat a lawsuit brought by a prison employee forced to stay at her post who lost her pregnancy. Texas claims compassion for women but requires that their lives or a major bodily function be at imminent risk before a doctor can step in. And Texas claims to protect life by forcing a woman like Cox to carry a child who almost certainly won’t live while threatening her ability to have a child who will.

All of this is a reminder of the priorities of state abortion laws, which are not about the value of life in the womb, but about criminal punishment — and about crafting exceptions that will rarely, if ever, be used. Cox’s suit matters because it is historic, but also because of what it tells us. When the chips are down, given a choice between protecting women like Cox and criminalizing those who offer abortions, we know what states like Texas will choose every time.","['exposing', 'exception', 'laws', 'truth', 'texas', 'states', 'women', 'opinion', 'life', 'law', 'chilling', 'woman', 'abortion', 'cox', 'state', 'roe']","Conceding that a woman like Cox is right could threaten to send much else about criminal abortion laws toppling down.

40,‘Turtwig’ ancient turtle species discovered after fossil mystery solved,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Ancient plant fossils that puzzled scientists have turned out not to be plants after all, new research has revealed.

Instead, the small round shapes bearing a leaflike pattern were once the shells of baby turtles that lived during the time of dinosaurs. Scientists have nicknamed the turtle species “Turtwig,” after a Pokémon character that is half-turtle, half-plant.

The discovery marks the first time baby turtle carapaces have been found in northwestern South America, according to the study authors.

The results of their research were published Thursday in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.

“In the Pokémon universe, you encounter the concept of combining two or more elements, such as animals, machines, plants, etc.,” said lead author Héctor Palma-Castro, a graduate student of paleobotany at the National University of Colombia, in a statement.

“So, when you have a fossil initially classified as a plant that turns out to be a baby turtle, a few Pokémon immediately come to mind. In this case, Turtwig, a baby turtle with a leaf attached to its head.”

But it took some sleuthing to solve this paleontological mystery that began decades ago.

Wrong place, wrong time

It all started when Colombian priest Padre Gustavo Huertas discovered the fossils in the Paja Formation. The formation is part of one of Colombia’s geological heritage sites called the Marine Reptile Lagerstätte of the Ricaurte Alto.

Previous fossil discoveries from the site include dinosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, ichthyosaurs, turtles and crocodile relatives called crocodylopmorphs dated from the Early Cretaceous Period, between 113 million and 132 million years ago.

Huertas collected fossils and rocks at the site, near the town of Villa de Leyva, from the 1950s to the 1970s. When he found the leaf-patterned rocks, he deemed them a fossil plant. Huertas went on to describe the specimens as Sphenophyllum colombianum in a 2003 study.

But other scientists were surprised to hear that the plant was discovered in northern South America and dated between 113 million and 132 million years ago. The now-extinct plant, once prevalent around the world, died out more than 100 million years earlier, according to the fossil record.

Previous research about the plant showed that its leaves were typically wedge-shaped with veins that radiated out from the base of the leaf.

The age and location of the fossils intrigued Palma-Castro and Fabiany Herrera, the assistant curator of paleobotany at the Negaunee Integrative Research Center at Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History.

Herrera collects and studies plants from the Early Cretaceous Period (100.5 million to 145 million years ago) in northwestern South America, a part of the continent where little paleobotanical research takes place.

Both fossils, about 2 inches (5 centimeters) in diameter, were housed in collections at the National University of Colombia’s department of geosciences. As Herrera and Palma-Castro examined and photographed the fossils, they thought something seemed strange.

“When you look at it in detail, the lines seen on the fossils don’t look like the veins of a plant — I was positive that it was most likely bone,” said Herrera, the study’s senior author, in a statement.

Solving a fossil mystery

Herrera contacted his colleague Edwin-Alberto Cadena, a senior lecturer and paleontologist who studies turtles and other vertebrates at Del Rosario University in Bogotá, Colombia.

“They sent me the photos, and I said, ‘This definitely looks like a carapace’ — the bony upper shell of a turtle,” said Cadena, a study coauthor, in a statement. “I said, ‘Well, this is remarkable, because this is not only a turtle, but it’s also a hatchling specimen, it’s very, very small.’”

Cadena and one of his students, Diego Cómbita-Romero at the National University of Colombia, compared the fossils with the shells of other extinct and modern turtles.

“When we saw the specimen for the first time I was astonished, because the fossil was missing the typical marks on the outside of a turtle’s shell,” said study coauthor Cómbita-Romero in a statement. “It was a little bit concave, like a bowl. At that moment we realized that the visible part of the fossil was the other side of the carapace, we were looking at the part of the shell that is inside the turtle.”

During their analysis of the shells, the researchers determined that the turtles were about 1 year old at the most when they died.

As young turtles develop, their growth rates and sizes can vary, Cómbita-Romero said. But it’s rare to find remains of young turtles because the bones in their shells are so thin.

“These turtles were likely relatives of other Cretaceous species that were up to fifteen feet long, but we don’t know much about how they actually grew to such giant sizes,” Cadena said in a statement.

The researchers didn’t blame Huertas for mistakenly categorizing the fossils as plants. What he believed to be leaves and stems were the vertebrae and rib bones within a turtle’s shell.

“We resolved a small paleobotanical mystery, but more importantly, this study shows the need to re-study historical collections in Colombia. The Early Cretaceous is a critical time in land plant evolution,” Herrera said.

The research team next aims to uncover the forests that once grew in the region, he said.

“In paleontology, your imagination and capacity to be amazed are always put to the test,” Palma-Castro said. “Discoveries like these are truly special because they not only expand our knowledge about the past but also open a window to the diverse possibilities of what we can uncover.”","['turtles', 'plant', 'million', 'shells', 'species', 'university', 'solved', 'fossils', 'turtwig', 'ancient', 'fossil', 'discovered', 'mystery', 'study', 'turtle', 'research']","CNN —Ancient plant fossils that puzzled scientists have turned out not to be plants after all, new research has revealed.

41,Woman who threw bowl of food at Chipotle worker sentenced to work 2 months in fast food job,"New York CNN —

A woman who threw a bowl of hot food in the face of a Chipotle worker has been sentenced to a month in jail — and two months working a fast food job.

Videos of the woman, Rosemary Hayne, berating Chipotle worker Emily Russell on September 5 and then throwing the food in her face at close range, went viral after the incident. Hayne, a 39-year old mother of four, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge and received the sentence last week in the Parma, Ohio, municipal court. Judge Timothy Gilligan gave her the choice of a 90-day jail sentence or a 30-day sentence on top of 60 days working in a fast food job.

“Do you want to walk in her shoes for two months and learn how people should treat people, or do you want to do your jail time?” Gilligan asked Hayne at the hearing.

“I’d like to walk in her shoes,” Hayne responded.

Hayne has yet to find the job, Gilligan and her attorney told CNN on Wednesday. Her attorney, Joseph O’Malley, said his client had no criminal record before the incident and that she is truly sorry for her actions that day.

“Let’s give her the opportunity to not let this one day define the rest of her life,” he told CNN.

Gilligan said Hayne will have to have her job approved by the court, and will have to work there 20 hours a week. O’Malley said Hayne does not currently have a job.

Gilligan told CNN he thought about the possible unusual sentence a couple of days before the November hearing.

“Every time you watch the video, it makes you more and more upset,” he said. “I was thinking, ‘What else can I do rather than just have her sit in jail.’”

Asked if he would want to hire Hayne if he ran a fast food restaurant, the judge said he doesn’t think she’ll have trouble finding a job.

“I don’t see her as any greater risk than anyone who walks in off the street,” he said. “I looked at it as someone who lost her cool.”

Gilligan said it’s the first time he’s handed down this kind of sentence, but unfortunately it’s the not the first incident of this kind to come before him. He said there was one case a couple of years ago in which a customer who didn’t get a cookie in a Happy Meal at a McDonald’s reached through the drive-thru window and started punching a worker. That defendant got 90 days in jail, he said.

“I see these cases more than I want to,” said Gilligan, who has been a judge for 30 years.

Asked for a comment on the case, Chipotle responded: “The health and safety of our employees is our greatest priority, and we’re pleased to see justice served for any individual that does not treat our team members with the respect they deserve.”

Hayne declined a request for an interview made through O’Malley. Russell told the court that she is still dealing with stress from the incident, and that she quit the job at Chipotle after the attack and found another job. She said she would like to begin counseling to deal with the trauma she is still experiencing from the attack.

One of Russell’s friends started a fundraising effort on social media for her and it has raised $7,300 so far, with most of that money coming since the first news reports about Hayne’s sentence last week. Russell told WJW in Cleveland that she was pleased with Hayne’s sentence.

“She’s going to get what she deserves,” she told the station. “She didn’t get a slap on the wrist. She’s going to learn to work in fast food, and hopefully it will be good.”

In addition to the jail time and time spent working in fast food, Hayne will have to pay a $250 fine and will be on probation for two years. Gilligan told CNN he’s not sure Hayne is as sorry as she claimed to be in court, pointing out that she was still complaining about the food during the hearing.

“She still has not picked up that this is not appropriate,” Gilligan told CNN Wednesday.

“You didn’t get your burrito bowl the way you like it, and this is how you respond?” he told Hayne during the hearing. He suggested she’s not going to be happy with the food she’s about to get in jail.","['fast', 'job', 'jail', 'food', 'cnn', 'months', 'woman', 'chipotle', 'hayne', 'work', 'worker', 'threw', 'told', 'gilligan', 'sentenced', 'incident', 'sentence']","New York CNN —A woman who threw a bowl of hot food in the face of a Chipotle worker has been sentenced to a month in jail — and two months working a fast food job.

42,"Harvard, Penn and MIT presidents under fire over ‘despicable’ testimony on antisemitism and genocide","New York CNN —

The presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania faced intense scrutiny on Wednesday from business leaders, donors and politicians following their testimony at a House hearing on antisemitism on campus and calls for genocide in Israel.

The criticism focused on the university leaders’ answers to questions on Tuesday about whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates their respective school’s code of conduct on bullying or harassment.

None of the school leaders explicitly said that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a post on X he was “ashamed” to hear the testimony, calling it “one of the most despicable moments in the history of US academia.”

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, speaking outside a falafel shop in Philadelphia that had been targeted by protesters, called Penn President Liz Magill’s statements “unacceptable” and “shameful.”

Shapiro called for the UPenn board of trustees to meet and discuss whether Magill’s testimony represents the values of the university and board.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told CNN’s MJ Lee Wednesday that calls for genocide at universities were “unacceptable.”

Private equity billionaire Marc Rowan wrote a message to Penn trustees saying he heard from hundreds of alumni, parents and leaders who were shocked by the hearing, including at least one who hoped the hearing was fake.

“Unfortunately, this is not fake and the University is suffering tremendous reputational damage,” Rowan wrote in the message, obtained by CNN. “How much damage to our reputation are we willing to accept?”

Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman called for Harvard President Claudine Gay, MIT President Sally Kornbluth and the University of Pennsylvania’s President Liz Magill to “resign in disgrace,” citing disgust with their testimony.

“Throughout the hearing, the three behaved like hostile witnesses,” Ackman wrote in a post on X, “exhibiting a profound disdain for the Congress with their smiles and smirks, and their outright refusal to answer basic questions with a yes or no answer.”

Ackman, a Harvard graduate who has been a vocal critic of how universities have addressed antisemitism, posted a clip from the exchange at the hearing where the university leaders were asked about calls for the genocide of Jews.

“They must all resign in disgrace. If a CEO of one of our companies gave a similar answer, he or she would be toast within the hour,” Ackman said on X. “The answers they gave reflect the profound moral bankruptcy of Presidents Gay, Magill and Kornbluth.”

In response to Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik asking whether calling for the genocide of Jews would violate Penn’s code of conduct, Penn President Magill said: “It is a context dependent decision.”

Stefanik responded with shock.

“That’s your testimony today? Calling for the genocide of Jews is dependent on the context? That is not bullying or harassment? This is the easiest question to answer yes for,” Stefanik said.

Ackman strongly criticized the response.

“Why has antisemitism exploded on campus and around the world? Because of leaders like Presidents Gay, Magill and Kornbluth who believe genocide depends on the context,” Ackman said.

The criticism of the university leaders was so strong that Harvard and Penn felt compelled to issue new statements attempting to clarify the testimony.

“There are some who have confused a right to free expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for violence against Jewish students,” Gay said in the new statement posted on X. “Let me be clear: Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.”

In a short video released Wednesday night, Magill echoed Gay’s response and said the university would immediately review and clarify its policies on hate speech.

“I was not focused on – but I should have been – the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It’s evil. Plain, and simple,” Magill said in a video posted on X. “I want to be clear: A call for genocide of Jewish people … would be harassment or intimidation.”

Magill noted antisemitic speech is designed to threaten and terrify Jews and remind them of the Holocaust, pogroms and other recent acts of violence against them.

“As president, I’m committed to a safe, secure and supportive environment so all members of our community can thrive,” Magill added. “We can – and we will – get this right.”

Representatives at MIT were not immediately available to respond to the criticism.

Condemning Harvard but forgiving Musk

Ackman has been publicly feuding with Harvard’s administration and some students over reports of rising antisemitism on campus. In an open letter last month, he said Harvard’s lack of action to rein in antisemitism threatened its funding from donors. And he called on the university to publicly name students who were members of student groups that blamed Israel for Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.

However, Ackman has gone easy on fellow billionaire Elon Musk, who endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X, leading to a revolt from advertisers. Ackman defended Musk in a post on X last week, saying, “After examining the facts, it was clear to me that Musk did not have antisemitic intent” when Musk said a conspiracy theory that Jews were trying to replace White people with immigrants was “the actual truth.”

Musk has since apologized for his post, calling it his “worst” and “dumbest” social media post.

The White House weighs in

The White House issued a full-throated condemnation of any calls for genocide Wednesday, just one day after the controversial remarks made by the presidents of Harvard, MIT and UPenn.

“What I will say is that is something that we do not stand for. We do not stand for calls for genocide, that is unacceptable, that is vile, we will call that out,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told CNN’s MJ Lee Wednesday, adding that, were administration staff found to have called for genocide, they’d be held to account.

But Jean-Pierre declined to say why university presidents testifying on Capitol Hill were unable to similarly say whether antisemitic or pro-genocide statements run afoul of their respective college codes of conduct.

“I can’t speak for those presidents, I cannot—they have to speak for themselves on this,” she said.

And she wouldn’t say if the university heads should resign following Tuesday’s backlash.

“That is not for us to decide on,” Jean-Pierre said. “Because they each… some of them are private universities, right? They have their own process, we do not get involved in private university’s process and how they run their university.”

Commitment to free speech

At one point during Tuesday’s hearing Stefanik asked Gay if the Ivy League school would punish students or applicants who say, “from the river to the sea” or “intifada.”

Gay explained that type of “hateful, reckless, offensive speech” is “abhorrent” to her.

“Do you believe that type of hateful speech is contrary to Harvard’s code of conduct or is it allowed at Harvard?” Stefanik, who graduated from Harvard, pressed Gay.

“It is at odds with the value of Harvard, but … we embrace a commitment to free expression even of views that are objectionable, offensive, hateful,” Gay said.

David Weild, a former chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market, said there should be no wavering when students feel threatened.

“I can’t believe we are having this conversation in the US Congress,” Weild said in a post on LinkedIn. “I’m a Christian. Shut the hate speech down on all sides. People deserve to feel and be safe.”","['mit', 'leaders', 'presidents', 'despicable', 'university', 'calls', 'penn', 'x', 'president', 'testimony', 'antisemitism', 'harvard', 'students', 'magill', 'genocide']","New York CNN —The presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania faced intense scrutiny on Wednesday from business leaders, donors and politicians following their testimony at a House hearing on antisemitism on campus and calls for genocide in Israel.

43,The minimum wage is increasing in more than 20 states in 2024,"New York CNN —

At the start of the new year, anyone working a minimum wage job will be paid more in 22 states and in at least 40 cities and counties across the country.

The higher hourly rates are due either to scheduled increases or lawmakers having indexed the minimum wage in their jurisdiction to inflation, most typically using the Consumer Price Index as their gauge.

Come January 1, seven states and the District of Columbia will have minimum wages of $15 or more, up from just four states plus DC this year. The newcomers to the category are Maryland, New Jersey and most of New York State (with the exception of New York City, Westchester and Long Island, which already had a $15 minimum in place and where the minimum wage is increasing to $16 in the new year).

The highest state minimum wage in 2024 will be Washington state, at $16.28, up from $15.74 currently. A close second is California, which is raising its minimum to $16 from $15.50 today.

The state with the biggest jump in its minimum wage next year will be Hawaii, which is hiking it by $2.

January 1 isn’t the only day minimum wages will go up. Some states, such as Nevada and Oregon, have increases set for July 1. Florida’s minimum will go up on September 30.

(See the full list of states increasing their minimum wages below.)

Cities, counties and some industries often trump state minimums

States’ minimum wage rates are often eclipsed by those in many of their own cities and counties.

Take the city of Tukwila, Washington, just south of Seattle. Its minimum wage will hit $20.29 in January, up from $18.99 now. At that level it will have the highest standard minimum wage rate in the country among states, counties and cities on January 1, said Jana Bjorklund, senior counsel and director of employment law and compliance at GovDocs, a compliance software provider for large, multi-jurisidiction employers.

Seattle, which will have a rate of $19.97, won’t be far behind.

Next year, at least 40 cities and counties are hiking their minimum wages, according to GovDocs. They include Flagstaff, Arizona (to $17.40); Mountain View, California (to $18.85); Denver, Colorado (to $18.29) and Portland, Maine (to $15).

And in some states, there are big sector-specific wage hikes on tap. In California, for instance, starting in April, fast food workers must be paid at least $20 an hour, and on June 1, healthcare workers will start earning between $18 and $23 an hour depending on their role and the size and type of employer they work for – an hourly rate that will eventually reach $25.

In New York City, app-based restaurant delivery workers (e.g., those working for Uber, Grubhub and DoorDash) now must be paid a minimum hourly rate of $17.96, which is set to increase to $19.96 by 2025.

The push for non-poverty wages

The federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009. And 20 states – including Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Alabama and Mississippi – still adhere to it.

The push to raise it has gone on for years because minimum wage workers stuck at $7.25 have lost substantial buying power.

Had it just been adjusted for inflation since 2009, it would be $10.33 today. But advocates for a higher minimum wage, including Holly Sklar, CEO of Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, would rather see it adjusted for inflation from where it was in 1968. The wage then was $1.60, which in today’s dollars would be $14.39. That $1.60 provided minimum wage workers with their greatest purchasing power, Sklar said. “Every minimum wage increase since 1968 has been too little too late. … Full-time jobs used to keep people out of poverty.”

She points to MIT’s living wage calculator to assess what a single person without kids would have to earn per hour just to cover the cost of basic needs (e.g., food, housing, transportation and medical care).

For example, in Mississippi, where the minimum wage is just $7.25, a person would have to earn $15.30 an hour in Pike County just to pay for basic needs. But among childcare workers, fast food cooks and cashiers in the state, the median wage (meaning half of people in those jobs earn less) ranges between $9.83 and $10.17 an hour, Sklar noted.

Given how little movement there has been at the federal level to raise the country’s minimum wage sufficiently, she expects states and local jurisdictions will continue to do the heavy lifting.

And she believes the economic case for their increases is there for both workers and employers.

For workers, of course, “It eases the burden,” Sklar said. “People replace tires they couldn’t replace or get their kids clothes.”

For businesses, she said, consumer spending goes up because minimum wage workers will spend their additional earnings quickly. And among other things, it will help boost retention of one’s workers because they won’t be as quick to quit for another 25 cents an hour. Less turnover, in turn, can reduce an employer’s hiring and training costs, among other benefits.

“It’s a virtuous cycle,” Sklar said.

44,Here’s why gas could drop below $3,"New York CNN —

The sell-off in the oil market accelerated Wednesday, with US crude prices sinking below $70 a barrel for the first time since July.

The latest wave of selling bodes well for consumers, suggesting gas prices could fall even closer towards $3 a gallon nationally.

Gas prices bottomed out at $3.10 a gallon in late December last year just before Christmas. The national average hasn’t been below $3 since May 2021.

US crude tumbled to as low as $69.11 a barrel on Wednesday, the lowest intraday level since June 29. Oil closed at $69.38 a barrel, down 4.1% on the day. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 3.8% to $74.25 a barrel.

Analysts said the selloff is being driven by a confluence of factors, including concerns about soft demand in China, record-setting supply from the United States and disappointment over last week’s OPEC+ decision.

“The market has fallen off quite rapidly,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates. “It could really be interpreted as OPEC+ losing its ability to control prices.”

Last week, OPEC+ members agreed to supply cuts but that agreement was met with skepticism because of the voluntary nature of the move.

“The OPEC+ production cuts appear to be more style than substance,” Lipow said.

All of this is welcome news for consumers. Even before Wednesday’s oil sell-off, the national average price for regular gas fell to $3.22 a gallon, according to AAA. That’s a fresh 11-month low and well below the peak in September of $3.88.

Gas prices are likely to decline another 5 to 7 cents a gallon in the next week, according to Lipow. He said while new turmoil in the Middle East or a Venezuelan takeover of Guyana could revive oil prices, there is a growing chance that US gas prices will drop towards $3 a gallon nationally.

Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities, described Wednesday’s sell-off as a “meltdown.” New federal data, revealing a large increase in weekly gasoline inventories, caused concern about weak energy demand, according to Yawger.","['according', 'drop', 'oil', 'gallon', 'heres', 'gas', 'crude', 'selloff', 'barrel', 'lipow', 'opec', 'prices']","The latest wave of selling bodes well for consumers, suggesting gas prices could fall even closer towards $3 a gallon nationally.

45,The Washington Post braces for historic 24-hour strike as journalists protest staff cuts and contract frustrations,"CNN —

Hundreds of staffers at The Washington Post are set to strike for 24 hours on Thursday, protesting recently announced cuts to the newspaper’s workforce and applying pressure on management to reach an agreement on a new union contract.

“Taking this historic action is not a decision we came to lightly,” The Washington Post Guild said in a letter to readers. “We take seriously the impact it will have on the people, issues and communities we cover.”

A protest of such magnitude has not been staged at The Post since the 1970s, according to the union, signaling how frustrated members are with the state of affairs at the Jeff Bezos-owned newspaper.

The union, which represents roughly 1,000 employees at The Post, has been negotiating a new contract with executives for 18 months, but it has yet to arrive at an agreement, much to the dismay of members who have expressed significant frustration with management over the process.

A spokesperson for The Post said in a statement that the newspaper respects the right of its employees to strike.

“We will make sure our readers and customers are as unaffected as possible,” the spokesperson said. “The Post’s goal remains the same as it has from the start of our negotiations: to reach an agreement with the Guild that meets the needs of our employees and the needs of our business.”

The labor dispute comes as The Post struggles financially, with the paper on track to lose approximately $100 million this year. To that end, The Post’s management team has moved to cut costs, announcing in October that it aims to slash its workforce by 10% through voluntary buyouts.

Patty Stonesifer, The Post’s interim chief executive, disclosed to employees when announcing the buyouts that the company had “overshot on expenses” and that management needed to “right size” the business.

Last week, Stonesifer warned employees that if 240 people do not volunteer for the buyout offer, layoffs would ensue. Stonesifer said in a meeting this week that 175 employees had so far taken the buyout offers ahead of next week’s deadline.

Staffers at The Post have balked at the need for cuts, often pointing out that the newspaper is owned by Bezos, one of the richest men in the world. Bezos has stressed that he wants The Post to be financially solvent.

During the 24-hour work stoppage, The Guild has encouraged readers to avoid reading or sharing The Post’s editorial content.

“On Dec. 7, we ask you to respect our walkout by not crossing the picket line: For 24 hours, please do not engage with any Washington Post content,” the Guild said. “That includes our print and online news stories, podcasts, videos, games and recipes.”

Meanwhile, management is working to ensure that The Post continues to deliver news to its readers during the strike. The newspaper will likely rely on its editors, who are not members of the union, to author stories.

The Post is far from the only news institution engaged in a labor dispute with its employees. Unionized staffers at Condé Nast have been protesting layoffs at the publishing company.

46,McDonald’s CEO: Bigger burgers are coming,"New York CNN —

McDonald’s has a burger strategy to spark growth in the next few years. That strategy can be boiled down to one word: More.

“In the US, in a number of markets, around the world, having a larger burger is an opportunity,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told CNN in an interview.

“We’re working on that,” he added. “That is something that you should expect in the future.”

It’s not just more burger in your burger. It’s more everything. The burger chain plans to open thousands more restaurants. It wants to add 100 million members to its loyalty program, which nudges customers into spending more. And it’s investing in more marketing campaigns to get people craving its burgers and fries — and, increasingly, chicken sandwiches, too.

Bigger burgers

McDonald’s has already been working on a plan to improve how its burger tastes. But it’s learned that in addition to softer buns and gooeyer cheese, people also want a more sizable burger.

“We’ve listened to our customers. And we understand their desire for larger, high-quality burgers that fill you up,” said Jo Sempels, who oversees markets where McDonald’s has licensed its brand, during an investor event on Wednesday.

McDonald’s plans to test options in limited markets and, once it finds the best one, roll it out more broadly, Sempels said.

That’s a similar approach to how McDonald’s landed on the McCrispy chicken sandwich, after failing for years to come up with the right recipe and branding. Now, Sempels noted, chicken amounts for $25 billion in annual sales across the system, just like beef.

McDonald’s plan for bigger burgers comes at a time when many customers are looking for ways to spend less — and as a pricey McDonald’s burger has become something of a symbol of inflation.

But the coming burger, though bigger, shouldn’t break the bank. “We think we’re going to be able to deliver a great tasting large burger at a superior value to what [customers] can get anywhere else,” Kempczinski said.

More restaurants

In addition to selling larger burgers, McDonald’s wants to be everywhere.

The burger chain plans to have 50,000 locations globally by 2027, it said in a release Wednesday. As of September 30, there were roughly 41,000 McDonald’s establishments in all.

The increase would be “the fastest period of growth in company history,” McDonald’s said in a statement.

It may seem like the global market is already saturated with fast food restaurants. But McDonald’s doesn’t see it that way: As humanity changes, the company should too — and add more restaurants, so it can maximize sales in all areas.

“With our current size and scale, some in this room might be questioning whether there is truly more space to grow,” said Manu Steijaert, the company’s global chief customer officer, during Wednesday’s event. “I’m here to tell you we see an incredible opportunity to grow the business by building more locations, getting us even closer to our customers.”

And being physically closer to customers really does matter to McDonald’s. People could get to a McDonald’s more quickly, of course. But it also means the McDonald’s can get to them more quickly, too, with shorter wait and delivery times.

The company has been looking at population forecasts in addition to “a hyper local understanding of customer demands,” to help determine how it should grow, Steijaert said.

Adding 9,000 locations in about three years will mark a sea change in the company’s pace of growth. The first McDonald’s opened in 1940. It took until the early 1970s to get to 10,000 locations, Steijaert said. And it only hit the 40,000 milestone in 2021.

Kempczinski spoke about the company’s need to evolve earlier this year.

“Our footprint reflects what the population looks like probably 20 or 30 years ago,” Kempczinski said of the company’s domestic footprint during an analyst call in July. “There’s a number of places around the US where we are significantly underdeveloped relative to where the population exists today. That opens up for us a whole bunch of development opportunities for us to go after,” he said.

Along with geographical changes, the company is also considering how the very idea of what a McDonald’s is should change as well.

Kempczinski added at the time that the company can now “[think] about small format,” because “of the growth that’s happened with the digital and delivery, where you don’t necessarily need the big dining rooms that you needed in our traditional restaurants.”

Over the summer, McDonald’s said it was testing out a new restaurant concept called “CosMc’s,” named after a little-known McDonald’s character.

As McDonald’s scales up, it’s still planning to stick to its regular formats, Kempczinski told CNN on Wednesday.

“The vast majority of what we’re going to build are going to be our traditional restaurants,” he said, which includes a dining room and a drive-thru, as well as spaces for pickup. “There probably will be some restaurants that are drive-thru and delivery only,” he said, “but that’s going to be the minority.”

More loyalty program users

In addition to the new locations, McDonald’s wants to significantly expand its loyalty program, taking it from 150 million to 250 million 90-day active users by 2027.

Loyalty programs let companies learn more about their customers’ preferences and allow them to offer specific deals that may help prevent them from going to competitors.

Getting people to commit to McDonald’s by joining a loyalty program is as important as expanding geographically, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald’s USA, said during Wednesday’s investor event.

“Historically, the number of our locations was our competitive advantage at McDonald’s,” Erlinger said Wednesday. “In the future, data will sit alongside restaurant locations as another significant competitive advantage.” Loyalty members visit restaurants more often and spend more than other customers, he noted.

A big part of the app will be about personalization fueled by artificial intelligence, Kempzcinski told CNN. On Wednesday, the company announced a partnership with Google, focusing on artificial intelligence. AI will be used behind the scenes, according to the company, and also to recommend food to customers based on what they like.

More marketing

“Maximizing our marketing remains a meaningful growth opportunity,” said Jill McDonald, who is in charge of wholly-owned international markets, during Wednesday’s event.

Marketing, she said, is driving higher sales at restaurants open at least 13 months.

One example of McDonald’s marketing success: the Grimace shake.

When McDonald’s introduced the shake, it probably didn’t expect the item to go viral on TikTok quite like it did: with TikTokers showing themselves sipping the dessert drink and then, soon after, writhing in mock pain or playing dead. But the mini horror films inspired people to buy shakes (if only to make more videos).

“One of the things that we’ve been hearing from our fans is a curiosity and an excitement about some of these characters that we’ve had in our history,” Kempzcinski told CNN. “When you do it the right way, it quickly becomes part of culture.”","['coming', 'ceo', 'growth', 'loyalty', 'going', 'restaurants', 'customers', 'locations', 'bigger', 'cnn', 'mcdonalds', 'burger', 'burgers', 'company']","New York CNN —McDonald’s has a burger strategy to spark growth in the next few years.

47,"This US bought a house in France for $20,000 without seeing it","CNN —

Her fascination with France began when she spent a summer in the European country while working as an au pair back back in the 1970s.

From then on, Ellen, originally from the East Coast of the US, made it her mission to travel to France whenever she got the chance to.

She met her now husband Joseph, from the West Coast, in the late 1970s and the couple went on to marry and have three children, continuing to travel to the country as a family once every two years or so.

“It’s funny, Joseph and our daughter would tease me, because anytime we were planning a vacation, I always wanted to come to France,” Ellen admits.

“They liked France too, but they would say, ‘Can we go somewhere else?’ [I would say,] ‘Yes, as long as we stop in Paris first or something like that.’ So, it was a compromise usually.”

‘Half house’

Ellen and her husband Joseph came across a rundown home in the historic village of Lonlay l'Abbaye in Normandy and purchased it unseen. Ellen and Joseph A.

Although Ellen and Joseph, who have chosen not to disclose their surname, had been toying with the prospect of moving to France for years, it wasn’t until they were both approaching retirement age that they began seriously thinking about buying a property there.

Ellen came across a tiny rundown home in the historic village of Lonlay l’Abbaye in Normandy, northern France, while browsing French real estate online, back in 2014.

“The house was affordable,” says Joseph, who previously worked as a business executive. “It was obviously a bit of a ruin. But it was within our budget.

“And that was always foremost in our minds. What can we budget? How much should we plan to spend on improvements, and so on and so forth. So, the budgetary element was pretty important for us.”

They then spent some time checking out the “charming” village on Google Street View, and eventually came across an account of two American soldiers who’d been “helped by the French Resistance in the village during World War II.”

The couple made the decision to purchase the house, which has around 400 square meters of living space, unseen, arranging for an inspector to view it beforehand.

While the property was on the market for around 18,000 euros ($19,400), Ellen and Joseph ended up purchasing it for around 13,000 euros following negotiations with the seller.

“It really wasn’t in move-in condition at all,” says Ellen, explaining that the house would need extensive work to make it liveable again. “The seller kind of agreed with that.”

Once the sale was finalized, they brought in local builders to begin demolition work on the property, overseeing things from their California home.

“They kept us informed. They would send us photographs to show us how the work was progressing,” explains Joseph. “And we would exchange ideas on how the renovation should unfold. So it worked out ok.”

The couple continued to travel to France regularly, flying over in 2015 and 2016 and checking on the progress of the work.

The following year they decided it was finally time to start the process of packing up their lives in the US and moving to France.

The first big step was applying for a long stay visa, which took a few months to finalize, then came what Joseph describes as the “wind down procedure.”

“Prior to your departure, there’s the decision to leave your homeland to go to another country, and all of the implications associated with that decision,” he notes. “All the preparation that has to be done in advance.”

They sold off many of their possessions, keeping only items of sentimental value, and set things in motion so that they could manage their affairs from France.

Big move

They completed extensive renovation work on the home over a period of nearly seven years, replacing the floors and walls, as well as the electrics and plumbing. Ellen and Joseph A.

Ellen and Joseph, who also have a property in New York, decided to rent out their home in California rather than sell it.

They then set about renting an apartment in Paris as their base while work on their Normandy home continued.

“We found that, to be in the parts of Paris that we wanted to live in, it was much less expensive to rent than it would have been to buy,” explains Ellen.

“Plus, the older that you are, the more difficult it is to get a mortgage. We would have had to have sold up and probably bought cash in Paris.”

They arrived in Paris to begin their new lives in April 2017.

Ellen and Joseph quickly set about getting to know their new community, while also traveling back and forth to Lonlay l’Abbaye to check on the renovation work.

“Each year, we budgeted for a different phase of renovation,” says Ellen, before describing how they replaced the floors, walls, electrics, and the plumbing in the home.

“We sought out good building materials and learned about ventilation and humidity issues in old stone houses.”

Ellen goes on to point out that they were able to keep the original staircase inside the house, along with a wooden cabinet that had been in the study.

While they had no choice but to get new windows and doors, they opted to replace them with replicas.

“We like to think that the ghosts of the American GIs who helped to liberate this village would still recognize our house if they walked past it on the street,” she adds.

Their goal was to both transform the tiny house into a liveable second home, and “restore it and leave it in good authentic condition for future generations.”

“We wanted to keep it looking the way it was,” says Ellen. “We didn’t want to make any big changes.”

Renovation project

""We're extremely proud of the builders, who managed to transform this from basically a small country ruin to a very liveable place,"" says Joseph. Ellen and Joseph A.

She points out that any major changes to the outside of our Normandy house had to be approved by the local authorities and the Architectes de Batiments de France, officials concerned with protecting monuments and historic areas, due to the house’s proximity to the village’s 11th century abbey.

But as the work continued to progress, the global pandemic hit, which led to renovations being halted for around two years and they were unable to travel to Normandy to visit.

Thankfully, Ellen and Joseph were able to resume work on the home once restrictions were lifted and had completed the structural work and painting by December 2021. Their new windows were installed a year later.

“We’re extremely proud of the builders, who managed to transform this from basically a small country ruin to a very liveable place,” says Joseph, adding that they’re still working on the furnishing and the “decorative side of” things.

They’d also eventually like to finish off the attic, which is currently used as storage space, and perhaps add a “half bath” up there.

Ellen and Joseph estimate that they spent a total of 65,000 euros (about $70,000) on the building works and labor, and a further 5,000 euros on appliances and furniture.

Now settled in France, they continue to flit back and forth between Paris and Lonlay l’Abbaye, stressing that they wouldn’t have it any other way.

“It’s kind of like a French Brigadoon,” Joseph says of Lonlay l’Abbaye. “There’s a certain magic to the village. The history. The Abbey. And everything is just so close. You’re surrounded by these small hills with trees and grass.

“It’s really a dramatic departure from living in a city like Los Angeles, New York or Paris.”

They’ve formed strong friendships in Lonlay l’Abbaye and travel there by train “every five or six weeks,” staying at their “half house” for a few weeks, before heading back to their rented apartment in Paris.

According to Joseph, the journey between the properties is a little over two and a half hours – their home is a 20-minute taxi ride from Flers station in Normandy.

Both feel that life in France has done wonders for them, explaining that they walk a lot more, and eat much better due to the readily available fresh produce.

“Our daughter thinks that we’ve definitely extended our lifespans by moving here,” says Ellen.

“It just seems like a much healthier lifestyle for us.”

Early on, they decided to “shoulder the responsibility” of learning French to make the transition easier, and stress that this has helped tremendously when it comes to forming bonds.

“Now 90% of all speaking that we do is in French,” says Joseph. “Even though we are far from proficient in French, it’s just something that really, really matters to us. And of course, it makes a difference to other people as well.”

However, the couple admit that they still occasionally find it daunting while attending a dinner with only French speakers who want to discuss philosophy.”

They’ve had to adapt to some of the cultural differences between the French and Americans, and say that some have been easier to get used to than the others.

For instance, Joseph points out that the French are “very, very private” in comparison to Americans, and perhaps less willing to share their lives.

“They don’t invite you to their home right away,” he notes. “They don’t address you in the first person.

“And that’s in contrast to the United States, where people are much more open with each other.”

However, Ellen acknowledges that she’s always been “more comfortable with the French frame of mind” when it comes to relating to people and forming friendships, so this has suited her fine.

“Maybe I’m just a little more introverted,” she notes.

The couple, who chronicled the renovation in an online blog, have found life in France to be more affordable than in the US, noting that their health care costs and property taxes are considerably less now.

In fact, they say the latter is roughly five to six times more on their properties in the States.

“I think that’s one reason why a lot of Americans are thinking of Europe,” says Joseph. “Because of the cost of living, and the property taxes, but also the health care.”

While they both miss living in southern California, neither has any regrets about leaving, admitting that it had become quite draining for them towards the end.

“The traffic. The craziness. And then, to some extent, politically. The divisions in the US were very stressful,” says Ellen.

“It’s not like we were having daily battles with people. But it was hard to watch. It’s still hard to watch the press from overseas and see how divided America is.

“Gee, it doesn’t feel like the America we grew up in anymore.”

They’ve gotten to explore much of France during their time there and have been enjoying learning about the different regions.

“We fully appreciate how much the French enjoy and appreciate the seasons, the moments and the food,” says Ellen. “It’s a different cultural thing, but it’s something you can appreciate.”

They say that they’d advise anyone considering a similar move to research their chosen destination carefully and refrain from trying to “replicate America” wherever they go.

“Leave some of those expectations behind,” says Ellen. “Because you don’t want to just beat your head against a brick wall, and insist on thinking like an American. Saying ‘well, this should be easy, and they should do it this way.’”

They acknowledge that spending so much time in France beforehand made things easier for them, stressing that things may have turned out differently if they had been less familiar with the country.

“We have encountered that with some friends,” says Joseph. “You [can] get some real culture clash.”

Ellen and Joseph currently have no plans to buy a place in Paris and say they’ll continue to move between their apartment in the 7th arrondissement and the countryside, perhaps spending eight months in Paris and four months in Lonlay l’Abbaye in the future.

“It’s kind of an ideal situation where you have a place to get away to. To enjoy everything that Paris has to offer, but then to also get a break from the noise and the business.”

Although they’ve returned to the US to spend time with their family and friends since relocating, they have no intention of returning to the country to live at this point, and can see themselves remaining in France for the rest of their lives.

“There are moments, of course, when we do miss a place, or something from the United States,” says Joseph.

“But this is a way of life. We’re trying to be Americans enjoying France and living here compatibly with the country.

48,"The Garisenda 'leaning tower' in Bologna, Italy, is on 'high alert' for collapse","Editor’s Note: Sign up to CNN Travel’s Unlocking Italy newsletter for insider intel on Italy’s best loved destinations and lesser-known regions to plan your ultimate trip. Plus, we’ll get you in the mood before you go with movie suggestions, reading lists and recipes from Stanley Tucci.

CNN —

It’s the ‘leaning tower’ that has stood tipsily – but steadily – for nearly 1,000 years. But now, the days of the Garisenda tower in Bologna, Italy, could be numbered. Following investigations last month, the city is instigating a civil protection plan for the “sudden and unexpected collapse of the tower,” which has dominated the Bologna skyline since the 12th century.

A protective metal cordon will be erected to “contain debris resulting from a possible collapse, to reduce the vulnerability of surrounding buildings and the exposure to the population, as well as blocking access to the off-limits area,” the city council said in a statement.

The cordon will be fixed into the ground, and will include specially designed rockfall protection nets, also made of metal and also anchored to the ground.

The warning of a possible collapse was issued in a 27-page report, shared with CNN, by the scientific committee which has monitored the site since 2019.

It puts the site on “high alert” and states that experts “believe that safety conditions no longer exist to operate on or around the tower, except within the framework of a civil protection plan.”

Monitoring of the site over the past month has revealed an “unexpected and accelerated trend” of “crushing” compression to the base of the tower, with gradual disintegration of the stone used to clad the base and cracks expanding in the brick above, it says.

Consolidation works which were already underway have been halted and an exclusion zone is to be built “in the fastest time possible.”

However, the tower isn’t on the verge of immediate collapse, a spokesperson told CNN.

“We’re acting as if it’s the worst case scenario but that’s not to say it’ll happen,” he said, adding that the precautions are currently on “yellow” alert rather than red, where collapse is imminent.

“We’re acting as if it’s about to collapse, but nobody knows when that could be – it could be three months, 10 years, or 20 years.

“If there was an imminent risk of collapse we’d evacuate everyone,” he said, adding that the monitoring equipment delivers readings every 15 minutes, meaning that they should get warning of a collapse, and can evacuate the surrounding area.

One of Bologna’s famous “twin towers” which dominate the city center, the 48-meter (158 feet) Garisenda was built in the 12th century when Bologna was a mini Manhattan, with dozens of towers reaching towards the sky, each built by local families trying to construct theirs higher than the last. Today, few remain. Of those that do, many have had their tops lopped off and been converted into regular houses.

The Garisenda leans at an angle of four degrees – only a little more upright than the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s five degrees. It was already leaning by the early 14th century when Dante wrote “Inferno,” in which he described the dizzy rush of looking up at the Garisenda’s leaning side. Shortened in later years, it sits in the city center beside the Asinelli – a tower twice the height, which tourists could climb until last month.

Bologna’s mayor, Matteo Lepore, ordered the area around the towers to be blocked off in October, although the move to isolate them was for research reasons, rather than safety ones. Acoustic sensors were placed around the Garisenda to monitor cracking and creaking noises, while a pendulum was installed in both towers to track movement and see if regular “oscillation” was going above a certain threshold.

That research has now found not only increased compression in the base of the tower, but that the lean of the tower has started to shift 90 degrees, from an easterly or southeasterly direction to southwards.

The conditions have been steadily declining since July, said a spokesperson for the city council.

‘Inescapably critical condition’

An exclusion zone will now be built. Comune di Bologna

Gradual disintegration of the rock attached to the base, as well as vertical cracks in the bricks that make up the tower, have been noted since 2020 but have now worsened.

The report, which was published on November 15, confirms that the tower has been in an “inescapably critical condition for some time,” and suggests that previous interventions, including a “hoop” of steel rods and cables around the base in 2020, have aggravated the situation.

“The overall situation has unfortunately worsened considerably, with worrying implications for the overall stability of the tower,” reads the report.

“The unexpected and accelerated trend leads the committee to immediately suspend all activities currently underway (especially consolidation) and to put the site on high alert. [The committee believes] that safety conditions no longer exist to operate on or around the tower, except within the framework of a civil protection plan.”

Extreme weather events, including high temperatures this summer and flooding earlier this year, also appear to have played a part, according to the council spokesperson.

Red alert

The cordon will be finished by February. Comune di Bologna

Materials for the protective cordon will be delivered to a site near the tower within the next couple of weeks, with the works due to be completed by February, according to the council.

But anyone who was hoping that the cordon would fit in with the medieval buildings around it will be disappointed by the renderings, which show bright red barriers around the Garisenda. However, it is hopefully only temporary – the report stipulates that any anti-collapse measures must be reversible.

The council spokesperson said that once the cordon has been installed, new research will be undertaken in two phases: first to find a solution to stabilize the tower, and then to resolve the underlying problem.

He said that the first phase might mean creating a metal “cage” for the structure. The second phase is causing more debate.

“Some say let’s dismantle it, redo the base and rebuild it. Others say let’s trim it [the tower itself] as was done in the medieval period. These are all hypotheses that we’re studying – the tower is nearly 1,000 years old and there’s no rulebook,” he said.

The works won’t come cheap – the cordon alone will cost 4.4 million euros (about $4.8 million), and any stabilizing work will cost “millions and millions,” said the spokesperson. The council has set up an online fundraiser with an aim of raising 3 million euros. It has already raised 800,000 euros in a week.

“The twin towers are one of the symbols of the city, along with the [UNESCO-protected] porticoes,” said the spokesperson.

50,Harvey Lewis set a backyard ultramarathon record by running 450 miles for four and a half days – while barely sleeping,"CNN —

There came a moment, somewhere on a roadside in rural Tennessee, when Harvey Lewis felt like he could keep running forever.

At this point, he had already been on the move, practically non-stop, for about four days, looping around the same roads, trails, and tracks amongst an ever-shrinking group of runners.

He was battling through feverish sleep deprivation on leaden, depleted legs, and on the front of his sweat-stained vest he wore the splattered evidence of an earlier nosebleed.

But looks can be deceiving, and deep in the corner of his stubborn mind, Lewis knew that he held the golden ticket to winning this backyard ultramarathon race: ensure that every other competitor quits before you.

As the race wore on, he began to feel unstoppable.

“It was like a frequency I found with my rhythm and my pace,” says Lewis, “where I could just maintain that for an incredible amount of time.

“There was some sort of place where my brain took over … and the body finally surrendered to my mind.”

This was at Big’s Backyard Ultra in October, the world championships of backyard ultrarunning.

The discipline of ultrarunning is broadly defined as any distance beyond the 26.2 miles of a marathon, but a backyard ultra has no predetermined length. Runners complete a 4.167-mile loop on the hour, every hour until only one person is left standing. The other competitors are deemed not to have finished, either by dropping out or failing to complete a loop within the cut-off time.

Lewis, a high school teacher and seasoned distance runner from Cincinnati, entered uncharted territory as far as backyard ultras are concerned, completing a scarcely believable 108 loops – the equivalent of 450 miles – over four and a half days at Big’s.

His gargantuan feat of endurance and resilience eventually came to an end when his final competitor, Ihor Verys, failed to complete his 108th loop, becoming what’s known in backyard ultrarunning as “the assist.”

Several weeks later, Lewis is still trying to get his head around his world record – six laps, or 25 miles, more than Australian Phil Gore’s managed at a backyard ultra earlier this year.

“I managed to pull off stretching it to four and a half days,” Lewis tells CNN Sport. “That’s really kind of riveting to me. It sparks my imagination.”

In total, Lewis covered the equivalent of the entire length of Florida, or about the distance from his hometown Cincinnati to Atlanta, stopping only for a few minutes between each loop.

He was midway through his final loop when it suddenly dawned on him that Verys had finally succumbed to the race’s gauntlet of pain, handing Lewis the victory as long as he could haul himself to the cut-off one last time.

“Finishing the final person, you’re on cloud nine,” the 47-year-old Lewis says. “It’s like one of the biggest highs of my life. I couldn’t describe it, especially when it’s such a rigorous, challenging goal.”

There are hundreds of backyard ultras staged around the world each year, but Big’s is the discipline’s original and most famous event.

The concept was devised by Gary Cantrell, the gatekeeper of some of the world’s most punishing foot races, including the fabled Barkley Marathons. Better known as Lazarus Lake, or simply “Laz” to those in the ultrarunning community, Cantrell first staged Big’s around his farm in Bell Buckle in 2011.

The race consists of two different loops: one on trails during the day and another on roads during the night. The start and end of each loop is marked by an overhead structure which reads “there is no finish,” the first three words written by hand and pinned to the banner in crude fashion.

It is there that runners must congregate at the top of the hour, every hour in order to stay in the race.

“It’s a tribute to a human’s ability to just continually push that boundary of what’s possible further and further out,” Cantrell says in a video promoting the event.

Lewis, now a two-time winner and three-time assist, is a dedicated disciple of Big’s. He credits success in this year’s race to a combination of careful preparation, his previous experience on the course and at many other ultramarathons, and sheer force of will in the closing stages.

“I always believed that I was going to still be the final person, and I never lost the vision of that,” says Lewis.

His training for this year’s race was at times peculiar, especially when it came to managing sleep deprivation. During his lunchtime breaks at school, Lewis would roll out a yoga mat in a storage closet and try to fall asleep for three to five minutes as quickly as possible, simulating the short breaks he would get between loops at Big’s.

Other times, he says that he would run to the park and lie down on the grass for several minutes.

Come the race itself, Lewis’ sleep strategy hardly went to plan. Unable to quiet his mind the night before, he only slept for three hours and then didn’t sleep at all for the first three days of the race. After that, he was able to switch off for one or two minutes between loops.

Thankfully, he wasn’t derailed by the same “incredibly intense hallucinations” that plagued him during a backyard ultra in Australia earlier in the year.

“I actually saw these grass people and the trees came alive,” Lewis recalls. “I would fall asleep for just a second, my sense of sound was super accented. It was like that show ‘Stranger Things.’”

His strategy if he gets similar hallucinations in another race? “I feel like I would be able to, like, just run through that,” Lewis adds. “It would maybe make it very interesting.”

That’s not to say that his sanity remained entirely intact at Big’s: on the fourth day, he started to talk gibberish to the other competitors.

“I was semi-conscious, semi-dreaming, and I would just start to say random things,” says Lewis. “I had to censor myself and not just say whatever I was thinking in my dreamlike running state.”

He estimates that he consumed more than 40,000 calories during the race, all of which was plant-based – something Lewis says helped to settle his stomach when eating on the move.

His race diet was varied and plentiful: avocado and hummus wraps, lentil soup, peanut noodles, vegan mac and cheese, vegan yoghurt, cupcakes, and different fruits – blueberries, mangoes, watermelon – were all on the menu.

He also never drank water on the course, instead opting for fluids with calories like coconut water, Coke, or electrolyte drinks.

“I was always grazing on foods,” says Lewis, “enjoying my appetite and enjoying the smorgasbord.”

An upset stomach is one of myriad challenges a runner might face at Big’s. Another is the risk of a fall – particularly on the roots, rocks, and foliage found on the day-time loop around Cantrell’s farm – while rattlesnakes and copperheads can also make for alarming bystanders on the trails.

Lewis fell just once, evidenced by the reddish marks that appeared on the side of his head towards the end of the race. “I’m pretty good at falling,” he explains. “I’ve fallen a lot in my lifetime.”

How a runner responds to adversity can be crucial at determining how long they survive at Big’s. Lewis figures that the effort required in the race is about 70% mental and 30% physical, and he has developed unique ways of hardening his mind during backyard ultras.

“I have spirit animals that I like to embody in the race,” says Lewis. “With Big’s, I was saying that my spirit animal was the honey badger. The honey badger can be knocked down, beaten, bitten, cut – everything happening to it and the honey badger just keeps on going.”

The honey badger analogy can also be extended to Lewis’ ultrarunning career as a whole, his progress in the sport gutsy and gradual. He says that he achieved the qualification time for the Boston Marathon after 17 years of trying and won an ultramarathon 13 years after competing in his first.

He describes himself as a “chubby” kid growing up – quite the contrast to the man who these days runs to and from work, adding extra distance as he builds up to a race.

“It was an ultra to get to where I am today,” says Lewis.

He was running Big’s to raise money for the Brighton Center, an organization in Northern Kentucky which helps individuals and families to achieve financial stability and independence, and also wants to inspire people to invest more in their personal health – even if that means getting outdoors for 20 or 30 minutes each day.

And in terms of his personal goals, Lewis has started to reflect on what it might be possible to achieve in the backyard ultra format.

“If the opportunity comes again: how will I be able to go through that fifth night?” he muses. “How will I come out on that sixth day, and then will we get back to another night?”

Four and a half days and 450 miles might just be the start for Harvey Lewis. This is, after all, a race with no finish line.","['record', 'lewis', 'days', 'ultramarathon', 'sleep', 'minutes', 'loop', 'set', 'harvey', 'backyard', 'sleeping', 'running', 'ultrarunning', 'race', 'half', 'miles', 'ultra', 'bigs']","“There was some sort of place where my brain took over … and the body finally surrendered to my mind.”This was at Big’s Backyard Ultra in October, the world championships of backyard ultrarunning.

51,"UK government signs Hillsborough Charter, acknowledges ‘multiple injustices’ suffered by soccer stadium disaster victims","CNN —

The UK government has signed the Hillsborough Charter, acknowledging “multiple injustices” and vowing that no families will suffer the same fates as the relatives of the victims from the infamous soccer ground tragedy.

Ninety-seven Liverpool supporters died as a result of the April 1989 disaster at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, England.

“The Charter, which the Government has signed, seeks to ensure that the lessons of the Hillsborough disaster and its aftermath are learned, to prevent those who are affected by public tragedy in the future from having the same experience,” UK Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said in a statement on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons: “The Hillsborough families have suffered multiple injustices and, more than 34 years later, there can never be too many apologies for what they have been through.

“And I want to repeat that apology today, and thank the Hillsborough families for their tenacity, patience and courage.”

The government was responding to a 2017 report, published by former Liverpool Bishop James Jones, which consulted the families on lessons from the stadium disaster and made 25 recommendations which could help shape the response to future disasters.

Among those recommendations was a call for the creation of a special charter that would see public bodies act transparently and in the public interest.

The government’s charter also promises to implement a “duty of candour” for policing in England and Wales, which aims to promote a culture of honesty and transparency during investigations and inquiries.

In January, England and Wales police chiefs apologized for having “profoundly failed” those bereaved by the stadium disaster and promised “widespread” policing reforms.

On top of the 97 people killed as a result of the disaster, another 162 were hospitalized with injuries. According to the BBC, it was the worst sports disaster in British history.","['disaster', 'signs', 'signed', 'multiple', 'victims', 'suffered', 'wales', 'charter', 'families', 'stadium', 'uk', 'hillsborough', 'result', 'soccer', 'public', 'injustices']","CNN —The UK government has signed the Hillsborough Charter, acknowledging “multiple injustices” and vowing that no families will suffer the same fates as the relatives of the victims from the infamous soccer ground tragedy.

52,"The Hughes brothers had a historic night on the ice, playing in the same game for the first time as New Jersey Devils win","CNN —

The Hughes family had quite a night on the ice as brothers Jack and Luke faced off against sibling Quinn as the New Jersey Devils defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6-5 at Rogers Arena on Tuesday.

It was the first time that the trio had all played in the same NHL game, and only the ninth time in NHL history that three brothers had taken to the ice at the same time.

According to the NHL, it was the second time an American family had three brothers play in the same game, and the first since 1990 when Neal and Aaron Broten of the Minnesota North Stars played against their brother Paul and the New York Rangers.

The trio, whose parents were in attendance at Rogers Arena, were able to take a historic photo together at center ice before the game.

“Getting a picture in warm-ups was really good,” said the 20-year-old Luke. “Haven’t really let it sink in yet. Just seeing [Quinn] off ice. I hadn’t seen him for a couple of months.”

The 24-year-old Quinn had two assists for the Canucks, giving him 36 points for the season, the most in the league for a defenseman. Luke and the 22-year-old Jack both scored for the Devils. Jack also picked up two assists.

“Of course you dream you’re going to play with your brothers in the NHL one day,” Jack told the NHL website before the game. “You’re in the basement, hanging out, playing, but you never really think it’s going to become a reality. For it to happen, it’s definitely pretty wild. It’s three kids in one game.

If much of the focus was on the Hughes siblings, Jesper Bratt’s contribution proved key with goals from the Swedish winger bookending the scoring, with a late one-timer off a rebound with 34 seconds left sealing the victory for New Jersey.

The Devils raced into a 5-2 lead through the first two periods but the Canucks came back into the game in the third as goals by Brock Boeser, Sam Lafferty and Nils Hoglander tied things up before Bratt’s last-minute winner.

“Pretty good in the first two [periods] and then pretty ugly in the third,” said Jack, summing up his team’s performance after the game. “But we found a way to win so that’s all that matters.”

“It’s tough now,” Quinn said when asked if he could appreciate playing against his brothers. “I’m sure they’re appreciating it more than I am right now, but it’s very cool. Looking back the next couple of days or months, it’d be a cool one.”

The Hughes brothers are no strangers to making history. Quinn was drafted seventh overall in 2018, Jack went first overall in 2019 and Luke came off the board at fourth overall in 2021, meaning that each brother was selected inside the top seven in an unprecedented feat.

Jack entered Tuesday’s game leading the league in points per game with 1.76, while Quinn came in at fourth overall in league scoring, per the Devils.

“They’ve put their name on notice throughout the League,” said Devils winger Tyler Toffoli ahead of Tuesday’s game. “The three of them are all extremely good players.

With Quinn and Jack being completely established and superstars already and Luke not far behind them.”

Though this was the first time that all three siblings had taken part in the same game, it was the seventh time that Quinn and Jack had faced off. Jack has frequently gotten the better of the matchup, with the Devils having a 6-1-0 record in these clashes.","['hughes', 'luke', 'night', 'nhl', 'quinn', 'overall', 'jersey', 'game', 'ice', 'jack', 'devils', 'league', 'win', 'brothers', 'historic', 'playing']","CNN —The Hughes family had quite a night on the ice as brothers Jack and Luke faced off against sibling Quinn as the New Jersey Devils defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6-5 at Rogers Arena on Tuesday.

53,Copa América 2024: CONMEBOL announces 14 host cities as tournament returns to the US,"CNN —

CONMEBOL, South America’s soccer federation, has announced the 14 cities that will host matches at the 2024 Copa América as the tournament returns to the United States for the first time since 2016.

The 14 cities are Las Vegas (NV), Arlington (TX), Charlotte (NC), Orlando (FL), Miami Gardens (FL), Santa Clara (CA), Atlanta (GA), East Rutherford (NJ), Houston (TX), Austin (TX), Inglewood (CA), Glendale (AZ), Kansas City (KS) and Kansas City (MO).

The tournament opener will be played at Atlanta United’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium, with the final taking place at Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium.

It will be only the second time, after the special centenary Copa América in 2016, that the tournament has been hosted outside of South America.

Ecuador was originally designated as the tournament host but pulled out in November 2022 due to economic and security concerns, as well as a lack of viable stadiums.

That reportedly left just the US and Peru as the two nations willing to host the 2024 edition, with CONMEBOL and CONCACAF – the federation for North America, Central America and the Caribbean – jointly choosing the US in January of this year.

Though the US unquestionably has better stadium infrastructure than any South American nation, the decision to once again host the tournament stateside led to some criticism in Latin America.

“South America is having a hard time organizing its historic national team tournament,” Ezequiel Fernández Moores wrote in Argentine outlet La Nación in February.

CONMEBOL has encountered obstacles in hosting the last three editions of the Copa América held in South America. In 2015, the host nation was changed from Brazil to Chile due to the former already hosting the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.

Colombia was set to co-host the 2020 edition with Argentina, before it was postponed by a year due to the Covid pandemic. Protests across the country the following year led to Colombia withdrawing as co-host, with Argentina following suit soon after as the country grappled with high Covid cases.

The tournament was eventually moved to Brazil and played behind closed doors.

Now, for the third edition in a row, the host nation has been changed after the US took over organizing duties from Ecuador.

However, Fernández Moores questioned why the same scrutiny, particularly around safety, isn’t applied to the United States.

“It doesn’t matter that games can be played in California, the State that has just suffered four mass shootings in just 10 days in January,” Fernández Moores wrote.

“For the third year in a row, the United States suffered more than six hundred mass shootings in 2022. In the first three weeks of 2023, there have already been 39 shootings.

“It is unthinkable that CONMEBOL for its 2024 Copa América or FIFA for its 2026 World Cup would demand that the United States review its festival of naturalized violence, which kills in shopping malls, schools or on any street.”

But hosting the 2024 Copa América is undoubtedly a huge boost for the USA as the country gears up to jointly host the 2026 World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico.

In a country where soccer is still sometimes played in the shadows of the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL, a successful tournament for the US Men’s National Team could play a huge role in boosting national interest ahead of 2026.

The 2016 edition was an overwhelming success, too, registering a record average attendance of 46,000 and becoming the most lucrative Copa América to date, according to La Nación.

Coupled with Lionel Messi’s arrival at Inter Miami, which has garnered worldwide attention and caused spikes in ticket sales and attendances, the 2024 Copa América could prove to be a perfect warm-up of sorts for both organizers and fans alike.

Messi’s matches for Inter Miami have drawn star-studded crowds, while tickets – for both home and away games – are in huge demand, although the club has received criticism for hiking season ticket prices for next year and pricing out fans who had been loyal to the team prior to Messi’s arrival.

It’s unclear whether Messi’s stateside adventure will boost soccer’s popularity in the US long-term, but perhaps few people will care as long as there is plenty of money to be made while he’s still in Miami.

But the Argentine’s arrival hasn’t just boosted the coffers. His utterly dominant performances on the pitch – which have at times looked laughably easy – led Inter Miami to its first title in the club’s five-year history by helping the team win the Leagues Cup just months after joining.

Such has been his influence in 2023 after guiding Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of 2022, Messi was named TIME’s Athlete of the Year on Tuesday.

“At 36, two decades into his unparalleled career, Messi provided a singular stimulus to soccer in America. Attendance, ticket prices, merchandise sales, and viewership soared. His games took on the feel of a religious revival,” Sean Gregory wrote in TIME.

“With the US hosting three major international tournaments in the next three years (Copa América in 2024, the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025, and the grandest of them all, the World Cup, in 2026), it’s sure to attract even more fans. But Messi is an accelerant.

“With the most revered and influential athlete on the planet playing in Miami for at least the next two years, still performing at the top of his game – he won another Ballon d’Or as the world’s player of the year, his eighth, in late October – the US is now a soccer nation. A fútbol nation.”","['host', 'cities', '14', 'copa', 'tournament', 'america', 'nation', 'américa', 'world', 'announces', '2024', 'cup', 'returns', 'conmebol', 'miami']","CNN —CONMEBOL, South America’s soccer federation, has announced the 14 cities that will host matches at the 2024 Copa América as the tournament returns to the United States for the first time since 2016.

54,Aaron Rodgers criticizes ‘character assassination’ of Jets teammate Zach Wilson,"CNN —

New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has criticized what he calls the “character assassination” of his teammate, Zach Wilson, in the media following reports that the former No. 2 overall pick was reluctant to retake the starting position after being benched earlier in the season.

According to the report from The Athletic, citing multiple team sources, the Jets want Wilson to return as the team’s starting quarterback for their Week 14 game against the Houston Texans after experimenting with Tim Boyle and Trevor Siemian in the position, but the third-year signal-caller was hesitant to do so “due to perceived injury risk.”

Rodgers, who suffered a torn Achilles just four snaps into his stint in New Jersey, said that he believed the report was “chickensh*t at its core,” adding that he “loves” Wilson.

“First of all, you can go down a whole rabbit hole with actual sources, made up sources, why is someone willing to be a source?” Rodgers said during his weekly appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” on Tuesday. “What are they gaining out of that?

“On and on and on, but when you use sources and, whether intentional or unintentional, try to assassinate someone’s character like that report does for Zach, I have a real hard time with that.”

The 40-year-old continued: “How can you read it any other way? You’re basically saying this kid is quitting on the team and doesn’t want to play and is giving the middle finger to the organization.

“I don’t want to speak for him. He’s going to get a chance this week to speak and I’m going to let him speak. … (But) he’s gone through a lot of sh*t in the last three years and he’s got every right to be frustrated and disappointed about it.”

CNN has reached out to Wilson to offer him the right of reply to the report. Wilson has not publicly responded to The Athletic’s reporting and is scheduled to speak to the media on Thursday.

Earlier this week, Jets head coach Robert Saleh was non-committal when asked about who would start at quarterback for his team’s Week 14 game against the Houston Texans on Sunday, though he denied reports that Wilson is reluctant to retake the starting position.

“Let’s be clear, if [Wilson] was reluctant to play, he wouldn’t be here,” said Saleh on Monday. “I actually coincidentally just got done speaking with him. He came in about a half hour ago and we had a really good conversation.

“The young man wants the ball. He wants to start. He believes he’s the best quarterback in the room and the best quarterback for this team and the guy who gives us the best chance to win,” added Saleh.

“We’re in a society now where kids miss bowl games because they’re worried about their draft status, right?” said Saleh. “So empathetically, if that discussion had been had somewhere, and again it wasn’t with me, but if that conversation was had and it somehow leaked out to the media, I don’t think that’s indicative of his mindset. The kid wants to play.”

The Athletic story quoted anonymous sources talking about Wilson’s reluctance to return as the Jets’ starter.

Four-time NFL MVP Rodgers expressed his displeasure of the culture of anonymous leaks from within the Jets organization.

“We need to get to the bottom of whatever this is coming from and put a stop to it, privately, because there’s no place in a winning culture where – and this isn’t the only time; there’s been a bunch of other leaks.”

Rodgers added: “Some conversations are only meant for certain people and shouldn’t leave the building.

“There’s a trust that goes along with being in the locker room, where you say something to your homie and that sh*t doesn’t go anywhere. Or you say something in the team meeting room [and it] doesn’t go anywhere. There’s been too many instances this season where stuff is happening. It’s not OK, and we need to weed it out in whatever way necessary.”

CNN has offered the Jets a right of reply regarding Rodgers’ comments about anonymous leaks from within the organization.

Seeking their first postseason berth since 2010, the Jets – who waived Boyle on Tuesday and signed Brett Rypien from the Seattle Seahawks’ practice squad – were given a glimmer of hope last week when Rodgers was cleared to practice, despite the initial expectation that he would be out for the remainder of the season.

However, it is still unclear when he will be able to play, if at all, this season.","['sources', 'speak', 'quarterback', 'assassination', 'right', 'team', 'character', 'aaron', 'week', 'teammate', 'wilson', 'jets', 'report', 'rodgers', 'zach', 'criticizes']","CNN —New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has criticized what he calls the “character assassination” of his teammate, Zach Wilson, in the media following reports that the former No.

London CNN —

A painting valued at $15,000 just two years ago fetched almost £11 million ($13.8 million) at a Sotheby’s auction on Wednesday after being identified as the work of the Dutch master Rembrandt.

“Adoration of the Kings” had been virtually unseen since the 1950s, when it first came to light. It was acquired by collector J.C.H. Heldring in Amsterdam in 1955. His widow sold it to a German family in 1985, where it remained until it was sold by Christie’s in Amsterdam two years ago.

At the time of that sale, Christie’s attributed the biblical scene to the “Circle of Rembrandt,” suggesting it had been carried out by a student or an artist close to the famous painter, and estimated its value at between €10,000 and €15,000 (then around $10,600 to $15,900).

Extensive tests revealed changes that Rembrandt had made to the painting. Sotheby's

The monochromatic painting, which measures 9.6 x 7.3 inches, was purchased by an anonymous buyer for €860,000 (then around $910,000) at the Christie’s sale — more than 50 times the painting’s estimated value at the time. It was later identified as “a work of great significance” by the Dutch painter, according to a Sotheby’s press release published prior to Wednesday’s sale.

After the anonymous buyer consigned it to Sotheby’s, the auction house embarked on an 18-month research project to arrive at the painting’s true attribution and value.

The examination, which involved X-rays and infrared imaging, as well as intensive discussions with leading Rembrandt scholars, led Sotheby’s to conclude the painting is “an autograph work by Rembrandt.” Prior to the sale, the auction house gave the work an estimated value of £10 million to £15 million ($12.6 million to $18.8 million).

The auction house believes it was painted early in Rembrandt’s career, around 1628, when he would have been aged 21 or 22 and living in the Dutch city of Leiden.

A rare find

The vast majority of Rembrandt’s works hang in museums around the world, and almost all of those that have come to auction over the past three decades “have been portraits or studies of single character heads,” according to the Sotheby’s release.

As such, “Adoration of the Kings,” which depicts the encounter between the Three Wise Men and the baby Jesus, represented a “fantastic opportunity” in the art world, George Gordon, co-chairman of Old Master Paintings Worldwide at Sotheby’s, told CNN prior to the sale.

In a phone call with CNN, he said: “I would say that it’s particularly significant because it adds to our understanding of Rembrandt at this crucial date in his development and career, when he was clearly very ambitious and developing very quickly as an artist.”

The earliest reference to the painting appears to be from the 1714 inventory of a collector in Amsterdam, Constantijn Ranst. It was then offered for sale in 1814 and again in 1822, after which it disappeared from view until the mid-20th century.

It was included in museum exhibitions and referenced as a Rembrandt work by leading Rembrandt scholars in the 1950s, but in 1960 German art historian Kurt Bauch, who only knew the painting from a black and white photograph, described it as a product of the Rembrandt School and omitted it from from the catalogue raisonné he was compiling. Thereafter, the painting was “entirely overlooked and completely ignored in the Rembrandt literature,” according to Sothebys.

Gordon told CNN that those bidding at the Christie’s auction in 2021 “must have thought it was much better than the description and that it might well be a Rembrandt.”

Sotheby’s close examination revealed a number of changes and revisions that Rembrandt made, including to the baby Jesus’ halo and the Virgin Mary’s headdress, according to the auction house.

“Very few narrative paintings by Rembrandt remain in private hands, making this an opportunity for a private collector or an institution that is as rare as it is exciting,” Gordon had said in the news release.

“This sophisticated painting is in equal measure a product of Rembrandt’s brush and his intellect. All the hallmarks of his style in the late 1620s are evident both in the visible painted surface and in the underlying layers revealed by science, showing multiple changes in the course of its creation, and casting fresh light on how he thought,” he added.","['14', 'valued', 'paintings', 'sothebys', 'million', 'auction', 'rembrandt', '15000', 'cnn', 'christies', 'painting', 'work', 'sale', 'sells']","London CNN —A painting valued at $15,000 just two years ago fetched almost £11 million ($13.8 million) at a Sotheby’s auction on Wednesday after being identified as the work of the Dutch master Rembrandt.

57,Florence Nightingale: ‘Final’ photos of nursing pioneer up for auction,"London CNN —

Photos thought to be among the last taken of Florence Nightingale are among a number of items related to the famed English nurse going up for auction in London.

The small, sepia images were taken by Eliza Francis “Fanny” Pettit, who was Nightingale’s companion late in her life, and show the nurse sitting in an armchair, according to auction house Roseberys.

A photo from the sale shows Nightingale sitting in an armchair. from Roseberys London

They measure just 5.9 x 5.9 centimeters (2.3 x 2.3 inches) and were taken around 1910. Nightingale died on August 13 of that year, at age 90.

“The family history behind these photographs leads us to believe that they may be the final images taken of Nightingale,” Jack Wallis, a works of art specialist at Roseberys, told CNN.

“We can be certain that they were taken in 1910, and as such almost certainly in the final weeks or months of Nightingale’s life,” he said. The photos were exclusively exhibited at the Florence Nightingale Museum in London, confirming their authenticity, Wallis added.

“What makes them so special is their personal, candid nature - they are informal shots captured for posterity by a close friend to remember a much-loved principal,” he said.

Born in 1820, Nightingale was an English nurse who became the first woman to receive the Order of Merit, for her efforts treating wounded soldiers during the 1853-1856 Crimean War. She became famous as the “Lady with the Lamp” because of her reputation for making rounds at night to check on the patients.

Nightingale went on to play a key role in formalizing education for nurses, setting up the Nightingale School of Nursing at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London in 1860.

International Nurses Day is celebrated every year on May 12, Nightingale’s birthday, in her honor.

Other items in Thursday’s sale include a travel teapot and silver-plated tea caddy, given to Pettit by Nightingale, as well as a letter written by housekeeper Elizabeth Bosanquet detailing the last hours of Nightingale’s life.

In the letter, Bosanquet invited Pettit to visit “to look on Miss Nightingale’s peaceful face.”

“She passed away quietly at 2pm yesterday resting on her pillows just as she had been placed the night before,” it reads, according to Roseberys.

“It was very peaceful and merciful and one is so thankful she slept away with no suffering,” Bosanquet wrote. “We shall all be the better for her wonderful influence.”

Wallis said that “it is very rare for a collection of this nature to come to market, particularly in relation to an icon of British history such as Florence Nightingale.”

“The collection really paints a picture of Nightingale’s character and the last days of her life,” he said.

It is expected to fetch £15,000-25,000 ($19,000-31,000) at auction.","['pioneer', 'florence', 'taken', 'london', 'life', 'auction', 'nurse', 'nursing', 'photos', 'nightingales', 'final', 'pettit', 'bosanquet', 'nightingale']","London CNN —Photos thought to be among the last taken of Florence Nightingale are among a number of items related to the famed English nurse going up for auction in London.

CNN —

US military forces once again confronted aggressive, potentially deadly moves by Iran-allied militias in the Middle East over the weekend. It’s further evidence that American efforts to deter these militias’ dangerous, persistent belligerence are simply not working. The message to Iran is not getting through.

Frida Ghitis CNN

On Sunday, explosions rocked the Red Sea¸ the narrow but pivotal body of water that connects Europe to the Middle East and Asia. Yemen’s Houthi militias, closely allied with Iran, were firing missiles at commercial vessels and possibly at US naval ships, so the United States fired back, shooting down drones, repeating a now familiar but increasingly perilous cycle that threatens to escalate with potentially ominous consequences.

The USS Carney responded amid a series of four attacks by the Houthis, according to US Central Command. Most of the militia’s targets were civilian cargo ships, but, worryingly, at least one armed drone was “headed toward Carney although its specific target is not clear,” the US statement said.

The continuing attacks by militias allied with Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, targeting US forces across the Middle East along with civilian vessels, are posing an untenable dilemma for the Biden administration.

The White House wisely wants to prevent the war between Israel and Hamas — like the Houthis a member of Iran’s “axis of resistance” — from expanding into a regional conflict. But Iran’s proxies are relentlessly taunting the Americans. Iran’s partners have launched at least 76 separate attacks against US forces in Syria and Iraq since mid-October, a defense official told CNN. They attack American targets almost daily.

The Biden administration is trying to modulate its response, hitting back hard enough to deter Iran with multiple strikes against a variety of targets — killing Iran-backed militia members in Iraq this weekend, striking IRGC weapons depots in Syria, warning Hezbollah in Lebanon to think twice before jumping in — but not so hard that it falls into the trap of getting involved in another war, which neither President Joe Biden nor any responsible person in America wants.

Iran knows that.

Some Republicans are critical of the Biden administration for not doing more to prevent the attacks by the Houthis and other Iran proxies. Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, a Democrat, recently urged a more aggressive approach as well.

As Israel and Hamas battle each other, Iran is showcasing its defiance, trying to flex its muscle, highlighting its geographic reach across several Mideast countries, perhaps seeking to intimidate other regional rivals, along with Israel and even the United States. By keeping its own uniformed fighters largely out of the fray, Tehran has plausible deniability about its involvement in the attacks.

Few are fooled. Central Command’s statement on Sunday declared that the US believes the Houthi attacks “are fully enabled by Iran.”

For the Houthis, these violent expressions of solidarity with Hamas constitute an opportunity to burnish their standing among the Arab and Muslim publics, who are siding strongly with the Palestinians.

Whatever the motivation, the continuing attacks, and the escalating threats to civil navigation cannot be allowed to stand.

One of the most urgent items on the agenda is stabilizing conditions on the Red Sea. Look at a map. The Red Sea is the channel that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the rest of the Middle East and Asia. Any commerce between China, India or other Asian countries with Europe or the US East Coast has to pass through the Suez Canal that links the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The Houthis pose a grave threat to international commerce and the global economy, not to mention regional stability.

The US and NATO should assertively defend freedom of navigation. The Houthis, an Iran-armed organization, needs to be confronted before a disaster at sea sends shockwaves of disruption across the global economy.

In the first place, Houthis must be designated as a terrorist organization once again.

Last month, the Biden administration revealed that it is reviewing “potential terrorist designations” for the Shia extremist group. Already members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, are urging the administration to do just that.

The move would confirm the shift in the administration’s geopolitical stance and the waning influence on Biden’s foreign policy by progressive forces within the Democratic Party.

In February 2021, just a month after Biden’s inauguration, one of the first acts of Secretary of State Antony Blinken was lifting the Houthis’ designation as a terrorist group.

The decision was remarkable because the State Department’s announcement confirmed that the Houthis are, in fact, terrorists, noting that the group formally known as Ansarallah, was “kidnapping and torturing citizens of the United States and many of our allies, diverting humanitarian aid, brutally repressing Yemenis.”

Still, the war between the Houthi rebels and the government they sought to unseat in Yemen, backed by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia, had become a major humanitarian catastrophe. Progressive figures argued that lifting the terrorist designation — regardless of its accuracy — would save lives.

In those days, the Biden administration was trying to cool relations with Saudi Arabia, a plan that later also went into reverse.

That the Houthis are terrorists is beyond dispute. They have imprisoned and tortured countless Yemenites and foreigners. Human rights organizations have thoroughly documented their violations. They have crushed women’s rights, imprisoning and torturing women, prompting critics to suggest Yemen is headed in Afghanistan’s Taliban direction. They’ve gone after journalists, sentencing them to death before subjecting them to torture, and routinely abusing other civilians while blocking humanitarian assistance from reaching them.

Their insurgency rose out of the remote Saada governorate of Yemen, where the ethnic Houthis practice Zaidi Shia Islam. The Houthis accused the government of then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh of corruption and of being too close to Saudi Arabia and the United States.

Supported, armed and trained by Iran, they adopted the very revealing anti-American and antisemitic slogan, “God is greatest (Allahu Akbar), death to America, death to Israel, cursed be the Jews, victory to Islam.”

The Houthis say their attacks will continue until Israel stops its campaign in Gaza. But, like Hamas, Iran, Hezbollah and other members of the so-called axis of resistance, they oppose any permanent reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians and support Israel’s destruction.

Since the October 7 Hamas massacre of Israelis that triggered the current war, the Houthis have seized a Japan-chartered cargo ship, and they have targeted a UK-owned and operated vessel, among others. They also fired ballistic missiles toward the USS Mason as the American Navy ship responded to a distress call from another civilian ship under attack.

In addition, the Houthis have launched guided missiles toward Israeli cities. American and Israeli defensive weapons have shot those down, but these moves raise the troubling question of what would ensue if a Yemeni missile hit an Israeli city.

Formally designating the Houthis a terrorist organization would provide moral clarity and prevent the Houthis from using US financial institutions and other facilities, and it would be unlikely to have negative humanitarian repercussions.

The brutal civil war that plunged Yemen’s civilians into a catastrophe is winding down after a 2022 ceasefire. Like other Iran-linked militias, the Houthis remain a source of instability, propelled by an uncompromising and repressive ideology.

Their actions, and those of other militias that are repeatedly attacking US forces require a more forceful response. The United States needs to continue calibrating its pushback carefully, but the current level is not sending the necessary message that the attacks must stop.","['sea', 'terrorist', 'tougher', 'opinion', 'attacks', 'militias', 'middle', 'east', 'united', 'biden', 'send', 'war', 'irans', 'iran', 'message', 'houthis', 'red', 'proxies']","Frida Ghitis CNNOn Sunday, explosions rocked the Red Sea¸ the narrow but pivotal body of water that connects Europe to the Middle East and Asia.

59,Opinion: What do you expect when an oil executive runs the climate talks?,"Editor’s Note: John D. Sutter is a climate journalist and nonfiction filmmaker. He is the Ted Turner Visiting Professor of Environmental Media at the George Washington University. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

As someone who’s been reporting on the climate crisis for more than a decade, I can say that the most insidious threat to climate action isn’t denial or apathy.

John D. Sutter Beth Mickalonis

It’s doubt and confusion.

That’s why the news from COP28 in Dubai is so infuriating.

The COP — an international peer-pressure meeting meant to avert disastrous global warming — is supposed to be a moment of resounding clarity, when world leaders come together to re-up their commitments to abandon fossil fuels and promote a future that’s, you know, livable.

The message should be clear: The world can and should abandon fossil fuels as quickly as possible in favor of cleaner energy sources like wind and solar.

We have the technology and the political levers we need to succeed.

Instead, the COP28 talks have been mired in controversy and confusion.

The United Arab Emirates, a petrostate, is hosting the talks. The COP president is Sultan Al Jaber, the head of a renewable energy company and also the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.

Appointing an oil exec to run global climate negotiations is not unlike letting the NRA facilitate a symposium on gun control.

No surprise, then, that Al Jaber made some, well, stupefying comments, including that abandoning fossil fuels — which, again, should be the point of these talks — risks putting us “back into caves.” He also claimed, falsely, that there is “no science” supporting a total phase-out of fossil fuels in order to meet temperature goals that are the center of the negotiations.

“Please, help me, show me a roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuels that will allow for sustainable socio-economic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves,” he said on November 21, in the days leading up to the COP28 summit. The remarks were part of a conversation with Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and UN special climate envoy, and were first reported by The Guardian, which posted a video of the discussion.

“There is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5C,” he said, referencing a temperature target from the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

A report issued Sunday during COP28 by the UN Environment Programme and others states that “a rapid and managed fossil fuel phase-out is required” to meet global climate goals.

Al Jaber tried to walk back the comments at a press conference on Monday, saying that he respects science and that the comments were subject to “misrepresentation.” “I have said over and over that the phase-down and the phase-out of fossil fuels is inevitable,” he said.

By then, however, the damage had been done.

Observers are right to question Al Jaber’s intentions and the intent of this entire process. And the public could understandably be confused about whether these efforts are even worthwhile.

That’s tragic, especially in light of the long and frustrating history of fossil fuel interests injecting doubt into policy conversations about the climate crisis. The broad strokes of climate science have been well understood for several decades now.

Starting in the 1970s, fossil fuel companies took a page from the tobacco industry’s playbook and started injecting doubt and confusion into well-settled science. John D. Sutter

But starting in the 1970s, fossil fuel companies took a page from the tobacco industry’s playbook and started injecting doubt and confusion into well-settled science. The fallout of that doubt still haunts political conversations about the climate crisis today. It leads to years and decades of stalled or flimsy action.

It’s also frustrating given that the public has few opportunities to focus on global warming — and the annual COP meeting tends to be one such moment when the world pays attention.

In the United States, only 35% of adults talk about the climate crisis at least occasionally, according to a 2021 survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

Slightly less — 33% — hear about it at least once a week in the media.

Not quite what you’d expect given that the habitability of our planet is in jeopardy. We are living with the consequences of a world we’ve warmed today — in the form of wildfires, extreme weather, searing drought and a burgeoning extinction crisis in the natural world.

If there’s a silver lining to the fact that Al Jaber’s comments have been wildly distracting, and disruptive, it’s that there is some benefit to plainly observing the predicament we are in.

Heat-trapping pollution from fossil fuels continues to go up year after year.

There are plenty of people and companies who profit from it.

Perhaps calling for Al Jaber to resign is part of a short-term solution to restore the credibility of COP28 and all the COP meetings still to come. But there’s a bigger point on which there must be absolute clarity in the public mind: We must demand a total phase-out of fossil fuels.

World leaders at COP28 can and should deliver on that promise.

And the public must hold them to account.","['expect', 'runs', 'climate', 'opinion', 'oil', 'fuels', 'phaseout', 'executive', 'science', 'world', 'fossil', 'cop28', 'talks', 'fuel', 'doubt', 'crisis']","CNN —As someone who’s been reporting on the climate crisis for more than a decade, I can say that the most insidious threat to climate action isn’t denial or apathy.

CNN —

Arguments are raging over whether Israel is adequately protecting civilian life in a war that has killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health and whether the world has adequately responded to a brutal terrorist attack in which Hamas, according to Israeli officials, killed more than 1,400 Israelis, raped women and kidnapped civilians.

Jill Filipovic Courtesy Jill Filipovic

Perhaps the last thing we need right now is that we’re grappling with controversy over what celebrities should or shouldn’t say, and how they should apologize when they inevitably botch commentary over complex world events.

Julianna Margulies, for example, has apologized for offensive comments she made on a podcast last month, in which she said she was disappointed that the Black and LGBTQ communities hadn’t come out in full-throated support of Jews in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks and the ongoing war in Gaza. “The fact that the entire Black community isn’t standing with us, to me, says either they just don’t know or they’ve been brainwashed to hate Jews,” she said.

She also said that, as an actress who played a lesbian on TV, she was offended by pro-Palestinian LGBTQ activists who “have no idea that if they stepped foot in an Islamic country” they “will be the first people beheaded and their heads played with… like a soccer ball on a field.”

Margulies apologized in an emailed statement to CNN on Friday, saying she is “horrified” that she “offended the Black and LGBTQIA+ communities, communities I truly love and respect.”

“I want to be 100% clear: Racism, homophobia, sexism, or any prejudice against anyone’s personal beliefs or identity are abhorrent to me, full stop,” she wrote. “Throughout my career I have worked tirelessly to combat hate of all kind, end antisemitism, speak out against terrorist groups like Hamas, and forge a united front against discrimination. I did not intend for my words to sow further division, for which I am sincerely apologetic.”

Somehow, though, Margulies’s comments aren’t the only offensive and bizarre celebrity commentary on Israel and Palestine. Last month, Susan Sarandon spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally and told the crowd, “There are a lot of people that are afraid, that are afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of how it feels to be Muslim in this country.” Sarandon issued an apology in a social media post last week saying the “phrasing” she chose “was a terrible mistake, as it implies that until recently Jews have been strangers to persecution, when the opposite is true.”

Anti-Semitic events have been a stubborn reality of life in the United States, from the defacement of synagogues to targeted assaults on Jews to a horrific mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018. By late October of this year, the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks anti-Semitic incidents in the United States, reported that the numbers were up by 400%.

Model Gigi Hadid posted a criticism of Israeli arrests and detentions of Palestinians, including children, but got so many of the facts wrong she eventually took it down and apologized for sharing “something that I did not fact check or deeply think about prior to reposting.” Several Hollywood figures who have opined about Israel or Palestine or both have seen swift professional consequences, from backlashes on social media to being dropped by their talent agencies.

Others have used more measured terms and mediated means to weigh in. In October, more than 700 celebrities and other Hollywood types signed onto an open letter condemning Hamas and urging the immediate return of Israeli hostages; that same month, hundreds of others signed onto an open letter urging President Joe Biden and Congress to “call for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza and Israel before another life is lost.”

Celebrities have said a lot about this war, some of them far too much. And yet some commentators are nevertheless incensed about the apparent celebrity “silence” on the war – by which they mean, of course, that not enough celebrities are speaking out in favor of their side.

It’s difficult to develop a hard-and-fast rule for celebrity political engagement. Most of us, I suspect, appreciate it when celebrities throw their influence behind the causes we care about, and are pretty disgusted when they publicly oppose the causes we support.

But we can expect a few things from people who are famous for their beauty or acting skills, not their mastery of international relations. First, we can ask that they speak when their conscience calls, not when the pressure to post calls.

Celebrities are human beings who are more knowledgeable and passionate about some issues than others, and also live under the microscope of fame. If they feel called to speak out on a particular issue, good for them. But if they feel insufficiently informed on it, or even scared of professional backlash, that’s ok too — whether Taylor Swift comments on the Israeli-Hamas war may shape the opinions of some Swifties and lend strength to one side of the social media battle but it is extremely unlikely to have any tangible effect on the conflict itself. (Swift has not made any statements on the issue. )

Second, we can also ask that when celebrities do post about politics or world events that they take extra care to make sure that they’re getting their facts right, and that they have at least a very basic understanding of what they’re discussing.

When celebrities post on social media, virality often follows, and their words can shape thousands of people’s perceptions and beliefs. They owe their followers a modicum of responsibility by fact-checking what they’re posting (or, even better, have staffers double and triple check).

And third, we can ask that when celebrities get it wrong, they apologize with sincerity, and reflect on what happened and why. And when that happens, the public can choose to offer them some grace.

Finally, it might be more helpful for all involved to take a step back and ask who it is we should actually be listening to and who we want to be speaking out. There are a great many people who are subject-matter experts and knowledgeable observers and human rights defenders and careful reporters, not to mention millions who are living the conflict as it happens. Most of them haven’t appeared on the big screen, starred in any reality TV shows, sold out Madison Square Garden, or walked in Fashion Week. But they’re the people whose voices we should be elevating in these grave and knotty moments.","['sarandon', 'moments', 'media', 'rules', 'opinion', 'celebrities', 'life', 'israel', 'theyre', 'post', 'jews', 'war', 'social', 'avoid', 'susan', 'ask', 'margulies', 'julianna']","First, we can ask that they speak when their conscience calls, not when the pressure to post calls.

CNN —

Was this real?

My nephew’s voice broke. Although he was calling me from Greece, I couldn’t tell if his words were coming from 5,000 miles away, from my ears, or from my own racing, panicked heart.

It took a few seconds for the reality of what he was saying to sink in; akin to when a dark nightmare we bury deep within suddenly finds voice in another’s words, leaving us utterly shaken.

My brother Majed. His wife Safaa. Their children Riman, 18, Siwar, 13, Ali, 7…

And nine-year-old Omar, whose dream was to be a soccer player.

All six of them, my family members.

Gone.

At 5.00 a.m. in the morning, two hours before the announced truce came into effect, an Israeli airstrike killed my loved ones, along with their favorite cat, “Lucky,” while they laid in bed. As they either slept or deluded themselves into thinking they were asleep, shrapnel tore through the door and the ceiling that had shielded them for the past 45 days in Gaza. The very walls that once promised safety now crushed and trapped their bodies beneath tons of rubble.

Only Omar’s body was found, 20 meters away from the blast site. After this “fortune” of being found, the aspiring soccer player was hurriedly laid to rest.

The remains of my other family members still lie unrecovered, while my 71-year-old mother mourns in a pile of rubble, grieving for her tender and loving child. She hopes to shield their bodies from the hungry, stray dogs that roam nearby, fearing they might desecrate the sanctity of her son, his wife, and their precious children.

Days earlier, I was the one to share the news about the death of our cousin with my family over the phone from the US, only to discover they hadn’t heard about it yet. They live just minutes away but have been cut off from the rest of humanity for weeks now. They mourn the departed, yet there have been so many loved ones lost, leaving very little time to properly grieve. In a way, this cheapens the value of human life, where death itself becomes tragically abundant.

While some celebrate the meager number of humanitarian trucks granted entry into Gaza during the recent pause in fighting, it’s crucial to be aware that not a single commercial truck has entered since October 7. Barred from Gaza for two months, shelves of supermarkets remain bare, severely impacting everyone from civilians to humanitarian organizations that are already stretched past thin.

Water is scarce, and food has become so rare that a can of tuna fish would be considered noteworthy, not to mention the tenfold surge in prices for basic items like yeast, salt and canned beans. Cash is useless, leaving people to stand in breadlines, stripped of their dignity.

This is a facet rarely discussed in Gaza – people don’t want handouts, those with money would buy the things they need if only they could find them. Everyone is forced to rely on assistance now and not all organizations can effectively deliver it.

Before I lost connection with my mom, I heard close gunfire and shelling. Mom mentioned the Israeli military destroyed scores of residential buildings around them including our neighborhood mosque, stealing their right to worship, a place to seek solace or pray for the deceased.

This news struck me deeply – I’m grappling with a crisis of faith witnessing a genocide unfold, while my mother living under bombs and burying her loved ones still clings to her spirituality.

When I first began to write this days ago, I was pondering the fate of Palestinians in Gaza, and how life might change if this ruthless and bloody genocide were to cease. Far too many good people have been senselessly killed.

I wondered: who will step into the shoes of those gifted doctors, caring nurses and compassionate medical staff lost in Gaza?

Who will carry on the work of the hardened and experienced war reporters and storytellers who were killed in Gaza?

Can anyone ever replace the hundreds of educators, teachers, counselors, some of whom perished in the very schools turned shelters where they nurtured young minds?

And what about the thousands of students who won’t return to school and university because their lives and aspirations were cut short by a ruthless and senseless military campaign?

Who will take up the roles of the hundreds of engineers, makers and builders who lost their lives in the very buildings and streets they helped create?

And those coders, software engineers, techies, entrepreneurs, craftsmen, chefs – all gone, leaving behind memories and a trail of heartache.

Who will have the courage to dream of a future when the present is so uncertain?

Most importantly, I thought:

Who will fill the void left by the thousands of mothers and fathers who lost their lives due to the Israeli military destruction, leaving Gaza shattered and its people terrorized and scared as long as they live?

Again, I call on President Joe Biden to do everything in his power to stop the fighting and implement a permanent ceasefire, to stop the killing before other innocents in Gaza lose their lives.

These are irreplaceable individuals, not merely statistics or collateral damage but people cherished deeply by their loved ones.

In mere moments, they were tragically taken away forever.

I thought of those individuals deeply this week as I finally managed to speak to my family after two full weeks of no communication. There were numerous tears shed, unspoken words, and silences that seemed to scratch one’s soul.

Now, above all of these losses, I find that on the morning after Thanksgiving, at 5.00 a.m. in Gaza, the world lost a star soccer player. And all of these questions collapse on themselves.

Rest in peace, Omar.

You did nothing wrong. Your only crime was that you were born a Palestinian child.

CNN —

There’s a whole cottage industry in pop culture essay writing dedicated to trying to unpack why Taylor Swift is so successful. Is it because she’s the epitome of Americana? Or the ultimate vehicle for “millennial vibes”? Champion of the underdogs? The final girlboss?

Jeff Yang CNN

In fact, her popularity is anchored in the way she manages to be all of these things, and none of them for very long, pivoting effortlessly from persona to persona and position to position; shedding her skin when necessary (like the “snake” she was famously compared to by Kim Kardashian) to reveal fresh new colors beneath.

Constant reinvention is a given in pop iconhood, as countless prior and peer artists — from Michael Jackson and Madonna to Britney Spears and Justin Bieber — can attest. But no one else does it with the same casual, frictionless aplomb as Swift; her self-shifts don’t come off as acts of extravagant pick-me theater in the mode of Ariana Grande, or explosive artistic statements a la Beyoncé. Instead, they’re more like chord changes; variations in the key of Tay — eyebrow-raising, but never too extreme or off-putting. Which means that throughout all of her evolutions, she has remained accessible, approachable, personable and projectable; a cool hang for the guys, trusted bestie to the girls.

This careful balancing act has been a key reason why she’s stayed relevant across a career of nearly two decades. And it’s why she’ll undoubtedly reach the milestone of best-selling female solo artist of all time (at over 180 million albums sold according to ChartMasters.org, only Celine Dion at more than 220 million and Madonna at 250 million stand in her way).

The truth is, though, simply selling albums almost seems quaint now as a benchmark of Swiftian achievement. She’s now increasingly being spoken about as an economic force of nature, a transformative creator advocate, organizer and innovator and arguably the most influential — perhaps even the most powerful — figure in the music industry.

It was Swift who, in reaction to Scooter Braun acquiring the company controlling her early music masters, chose the almost unthinkable path of re-recording her old albums one by one, creating versions of her classic songs that are now under her direct control. The move isn’t just an act of revenge against someone whose actions she’s referred to publicly as “bullying.” It’s a rebel stroke that cuts at the heart of the recording industry’s power over creators, and one that was only possible because Swift is songwriter on all of her original music, and because of the uniquely equitable contract she signed with her current label, Republic Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. Under the terms of that contract, Swift demanded full ownership of all of her master recordings going forward, plus a royalty of at least 50%.

That said, it’s another clause in the agreement that demonstrates the full weight of Swift’s power: In an unprecedented move that seals her status as a kind of Joan of Arc for creator rights, she said she also got Universal, a major investor in Spotify, to agree that if it were to ever sell any of its shares, a non-recoupable split of those profits would be shared with Swift and all other fellow Universal recording artists.

Swift has used the occasion of her reinvention of her musical past to launch an extended global performance circuit, the “Eras” tour, which could become the most lucrative music tour in history. It will, all in, represent a $5.7 billion boost to the US economy according to the Washington Post, while injecting a profound degree of monetary stimulus into every city hosting her, given that her fans collectively spend around $93 million per show.

In Los Angeles, where she played six sold-out nights at SoFi Stadium, the tour generated enough money to support 3,300 jobs. And Swift generously showered her staff with spiffs, giving each of her tour truck drivers $100,000 in the summer, and providing other bonuses to her sound techs, backup dancers, catering crew and other staff, to the collective tune of $55 million. She can afford it. Already a billionaire, Swift stands to personally make as much as $4.1 billion from the “Eras” tour, according to estimates cited by the Post.

That doesn’t even include the money she stands to earn from the concert film she shot while on tour, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” which in yet another example of I’ll-do-it-myself disruption she paid for out of her own pocket as an independent production, eschbewing studio involvement, and subsequently distributed it via theater chain AMC. It has already earned more than $250 million at the box office, reportedly just under 60% of which will go straight to Swift’s production company, which will get another revenue bump when the film hits streaming platforms for rental and download on Dec. 13, Swift’s 34th birthday.

Many have pointed out that her outsized success has nepo baby roots — the daughter of a Merrill Lynch stockbroker, she grew up on an 11-acre Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania, and her dad helped to boost her early success by buying part of her original label, Big Machine Records. Swift would have had a much harder road in her path to stardom, which began when she moved to the country music mecca of Nashville, had she not been White, a privilege she herself has acknowledged in recent years.

Still, it’s Swift’s undeniable talent, her resourcefulness and her (blond) ambition that have gotten her where she is — that is to say, the very top. I admit to personally being a begrudging fan, not just of her music, but her incredible sense of enterprise. I take mental notes with every new move she makes — and if someone else doesn’t write a bestselling business tome detailing the lessons would-be moguls should learn from Swift’s savvy, I will.

63,Biden administration announces new financial strike force to curb deadly fentanyl trade,"Washington CNN —

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday announced a new Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force to crack down on the illicit financial networks supporting the cartels and drug traffickers that help funnel the drug into the United States.

The new strike force, part of the department’s efforts to tackle the deadly fentanyl trade, will streamline personnel and resources across the agency to better leverage its expertise in countering the financial crimes that back the networks supporting the fentanyl trade, according to the Treasury Department.

“The Treasury Department’s Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force will allow us to bring the Department’s unrivaled expertise in fighting financial crime to bear against this deadly epidemic. Treasury will use every tool at its disposal to disrupt the ability of drug traffickers to peddle this poison in our country,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement Monday.

The strike force will be led by the department’s top sanctions official, Brian Nelson, and the chief of the Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigations unit, James Lee. It will “redouble Treasury’s existing work streams, including using financial intelligence to understand risks and map transnational criminal organization (TCO) financial networks,” according to a news release.

Several key units within the Treasury Department that specialize in financial crimes, sanctions, and tracking terrorist and illicit financing will be part of the new strike force. These include: the IRS criminal investigation unit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes.

The new strike force’s key goals include combining analytic expertise across the Treasury Department to help identify opportunities to go after money laundering and fentanyl trafficking networks; strengthening coordination on investigating sanctions violations; and creating closer coordination when working with foreign partners on identifying international money laundering networks.

The new initiative comes after the US and China recently reached a deal on curbing fentanyl production, and as the US Treasury Department has taken an increasingly active role in addressing the threat posed by fentanyl.

“The Strike Force will act quickly and decisively with the top specialists from across the Department to nimbly respond to the newest threats,” Nelson, who has traveled to the US southern border at least twice this year, said in a statement.

Investigators from the Treasury Department can access and share powerful financial data with enforcement bodies such as the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Department of Homeland Security as they work to track and disrupt the fentanyl trade and drug suppliers. The new strike force will also help streamline the Treasury Department’s efforts to coordinate with local and federal law enforcement bodies on potential financial leads.

As part of his talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, President Joe Biden said that China agreed to go after the companies that produce the precursor chemicals to fentanyl.

And earlier this year, the Biden administration announced a broad effort to target the production and distribution of fentanyl, which included criminal charges from the Department of Justice and a host of new Treasury sanctions. The announcement built off an executive order signed in 2021 that expanded the Treasury Department’s authorities to target the distribution chains of fentanyl and other narcotics.

There has been a governmentwide push to curb synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, which are the main driver of overdose deaths in the US. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there has been a more than sevenfold increase in deaths from 2015 to 2021, and despite a recent slowing, overdose deaths still hover near record levels and remain the third-leading cause of death in adolescents ages 19 and younger.

The new strike force will not undermine the Treasury Department’s other sanctions regimes, including targeting Russia’s war machine amid its invasion of Ukraine, but rather will ensure the department is “most efficiently” deploying its “limited” resources, a senior Treasury official told CNN.

Yellen and Nelson will travel to Mexico this week for a series of meetings with their Mexican counterparts and private financial institutions to further discuss how the two countries can better target the illicit financial networks fueling the flow of synthetic opioids into the United States and deepen the bilateral economic relationship as the US looks to “friend-shore” supply chains, according to senior Treasury officials.

“Friend-shoring” is a Biden administration goal to strengthen US economic resilience by diversifying US supply chains with friendly countries.","['sanctions', 'department', 'departments', 'drug', 'financial', 'fentanyl', 'force', 'deadly', 'trade', 'announces', 'strike', 'biden', 'administration', 'networks', 'curb', 'treasury']","“The Treasury Department’s Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force will allow us to bring the Department’s unrivaled expertise in fighting financial crime to bear against this deadly epidemic.

64,"Sen. Murphy open to placing conditions on aid to Israel, calls civilian death toll in Gaza ‘unacceptable’","CNN —

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy on Sunday said he was open to placing conditions on any aid to Israel, with the aim of reducing civilian casualties in Gaza.

The Connecticut Democrat, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” that as lawmakers return to the Capitol Monday with the elusive goal of passing aid to Israel and Ukraine, they will discuss how to structure aid to Israel so it is used in line with human rights laws. His comments, on the third day of the truce between Israel and Hamas, come as other lawmakers — on both sides of the aisle — either didn’t rule out the idea of conditions on aid or underscored concern about minimizing civilian Palestinian casualties.

“We regularly condition our aid to allies based upon compliance with US law and international law. And, so, I think it’s very consistent with the ways in which we have dispensed aid, especially during wartime, to allies, for us to talk about making sure that the aid we give Ukraine or the aid we give Israel is used in accordance with human rights laws,” Murphy said. “And that’ll be a conversation we will all be engaged in when we get back to Washington on Monday.”

Murphy has previously called on Israel to try to further reduce civilian casualties and to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, where more than 14,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry there, in the wake of Hamas’ brutal cross-border assault on Israel on October 7.

“I do believe that the level of civilian harm inside Gaza has been unacceptable and is unsustainable,” he said. “I think there’s both a moral cost to this many civilians, innocent civilians, children often, losing their life, but I think there’s (also) a strategic cost. Ultimately, Hamas will get stronger, not weaker, in the long run if all of this civilian death allows them to recruit more effectively and ably inside Gaza.”

But Murphy also said that Israel has a “moral obligation” to continue fighting Hamas following the temporary four-day truce between Hamas and Israel, which is now in its third day.

“Hopefully, Hamas will accept the conditions that have been laid down that will allow for more hostages to be released. But if they don’t, ultimately Hamas is going to be defeated,” added Murphy. “That’s in Israel’s interest, but it’s also in the interest of the United States. We do not want terrorist organizations believing they can get away with the kind of murder that Hamas did on October 7.”

The Biden administration has pleaded with lawmakers to come together to pass aid for Ukraine and Israel, but disputes over supporting Ukraine — and now over immigration policy — have marred the talks.

Some progressives have proposed adding strict restrictions on aid, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who released an extensive list of proposed demands for the Israeli government to receive US aid, including “an end to the indiscriminate bombing,” a “right of displaced Gazans to return to their homes,” “a freeze on settlement expansion” in the West Bank and no long-term occupation of Gaza by Israeli forces, as well as a commitment to engage in peace talks “for a two-state solution in the wake of the war.”

Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet indicated to CBS in an interview Sunday that he is open to supporting conditions on aid to Israel. “I haven’t so far, but I think that’s a debate we’re going to have in the coming days,” the Colorado senator, who services on the Intelligence Committee, said on “Face the Nation.”

House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, told NBC Sunday that while he wouldn’t propose placing conditions on aid to Israel aimed at lessening civilian casualties in Gaza, it is already the policy of the US and Israel.

“I think the White House has been clear, and I think US policy has been clear, of lessening the Palestinian casualties that are not Hamas,” Turner said on “Meet the Press,” adding that Israel has issued warnings to civilians about which areas will be targeted. “I wouldn’t propose it, but I think it does accurately reflect US policy.”

Murphy on Sunday also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s previous policies toward Palestinians, saying, “Benjamin Netanyahu believed that you could ignore the Palestinians, that you could try to squash their desires for a state and, ultimately, that would bring peace to the region into Israel. That’s just not the case.”

He continued, “Ultimately, the next government is going to have to put us back on a path to have a Palestinian state. That’s not easy, but it is the only way forward for Israel, is the only way forward for long-term peace.”

65,"Florida GOP chair defies DeSantis, won’t step down as new details of sexual assault allegation emerge","CNN —

The head of Florida’s Republican Party indicated Saturday he will not step down while facing an investigation into sexual assault, rejecting calls by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to give up his role as the party’s top operative.

In a letter to the state GOP, chairman Christian Ziegler did not address the allegation – which continued to send shockwaves through the state on Saturday as troubling new details about the investigation emerged – but suggested a conspiracy was afoot to leak details from the Sarasota Police Department probe.

“We have a country to save and I am not going to let false allegations of a crime put that mission on the bench as I wait for this process to wrap up,” he wrote.

According to a search warrant affidavit, which CNN obtained from the Florida Center for Government Accountability, Ziegler and his wife Bridget planned a three-way sexual encounter with the alleged victim on the day of the alleged assault on October 2, and “when the victim learned that Bridget could not make it, she changed her mind and canceled with Christian.”

Surveillance video showed Ziegler arriving at the alleged victim’s residence on the day of the alleged assault, the affidavit says. The alleged victim told investigators she “opened her apartment door to walk her dog and Christian was standing outside in the hallway.” The alleged victim said Christian entered the apartment and raped her on a bar stool, according to the affidavit.

“The victim advised Christian did not wear a condom,” the affidavit said. The alleged victim said she told Christian “she was not in a place to consent” because “she had been drinking tequila all day.”

The alleged victim later called her sister and told her she had been raped, the affidavit states, noting that police interviewed the alleged victim’s sister and confirmed the details of the phone call.

Police then interviewed Bridget Ziegler, according to the affidavit. She told detectives she knew the alleged victim through her husband and confirmed having a sexual encounter with the alleged victim and her husband “over a year ago and that it only happened one time.”

On November 2, detectives interviewed Ziegler with his attorney present, the affidavit states. Ziegler admitted to having sex with the alleged victim, but said the sex was consensual and that he recorded the encounter. “Christian said he initially deleted the video, but since the allegation, he uploaded the video to his Google Drive which we have not been able to locate upon a digital extraction.”

During the investigation, police said Ziegler tried to contact the alleged victim via Instagram. The alleged victim then began communicating with Ziegler with the help of detectives, according to the affidavit. In one alleged exchange on October 27, the alleged victim wrote: “I’m not okay with what happened the other day between us”.

“Oh. That’s not good. You are my friend. Known ya for like twenty years now. Lol,” Ziegler replied.

“Yeah I know but that was not cool and you didn’t bring her [Bridget] and then did that to me,” the alleged victim responded.

“She was in. Then couldn’t because no response. She said in next time,” Ziegler replied.

Several phone calls between the alleged victim and Ziegler were audio recorded, according to the affidavit. In one call, the alleged victim allegedly told Ziegler “he sexually assault her” and Ziegler replied, “Those are big words, please don’t, no I didn’t. You invited me in, that’s it. I did not at all, and I never want you to feel that way.”

CNN has made multiple attempts to contact the Zieglers. In a statement Friday, Christian Ziegler’s attorney Derek Byrd said: “We are confident that once the police investigation is concluded that no charges will be filed and Mr. Ziegler will be completely exonerated.”

“Unfortunately, public figures are often accused of acts that they did not commit whether it be for political purposes or financial gain. I would caution anyone to rush to judgment until the investigation is concluded,” Byrd said.

The allegations have not only raised questions about Christian Ziegler’s capacity to lead the party into the 2024 election season but have drawn acute criticism because of the role the Zieglers have played in helping to execute a crackdown on LGBTQ materials in Florida schools under DeSantis.

Bridget Ziegler, 41, a thrice-elected Sarasota County school board member, co-founded Moms for Liberty, a conservative parents’ rights organization that has led the efforts in Florida and beyond to remove books from classrooms they deem inappropriate for kids. She has also served as a close ally of DeSantis in his crackdown on removing sexual orientation and gender identity from schools. She helped author the Parents Bill of Rights in Florida, a law DeSantis signed in 2021 in response to concerns from conservative parents that schools were withholding information about children expressing a change in sexual orientation and gender identity.

This year, DeSantis named Bridget Ziegler to the board that now oversees the Walt Disney Company’s special taxing district in Central Florida amid his clash with the entertainment giant over a state law that restricted how sexual orientation and gender identity could be taught in the classroom.

Christian Ziegler, 40, has also fiercely defended DeSantis’ agenda against national backlash from LGTBQ groups. In an interview with the Washington Examiner, he said Democrats who opposed DeSantis were “perverted” and encouraged them to leave the state.

In his letter to the state GOP, Ziegler suggested that the information made public about the investigation was intentionally leaked because he and his wife are “such loud political voices.” He said the complaint and investigation should have remained confidential until the conclusion of the investigation, and that he could not publicly share his side of the story at this point in the process.

The letter came a day after DeSantis said Ziegler should step down as party chairman, telling reporters “I don’t see how we can continue with that investigation ongoing, given the gravity of those situations.”

“I think he should step aside,” DeSantis said. “I think he should tend to that.”

“I’ve known him. I’ve known Bridget. They’ve been friends, but the mission is more important,” he added.

Ziegler, though, outlined a timeline to remain in power. He told the party that his “role in the investigation is complete” and he anticipated a conclusion to the probe.

“When we reach that point, I will have a lot more to share about the facts, how this transpired, the motive and who was behind it,” he said.","['florida', 'investigation', 'emerge', 'ziegler', 'alleged', 'gop', 'victim', 'affidavit', 'step', 'desantis', 'defies', 'chair', 'told', 'christian', 'details', 'sexual', 'wont']","Ziegler admitted to having sex with the alleged victim, but said the sex was consensual and that he recorded the encounter.

66,Sen. Graham says he has ‘lost all confidence’ in Defense Sec. Lloyd Austin,"CNN —

GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham on Sunday called Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin “naive” for believing further civilian casualties in Gaza could produce even more insurgents and said he has “lost all confidence” in him.

“He’s so naive, I mean I just lost all confidence in this guy,” Graham told CNN’s Dana Bash, adding later, “This is a radicalized population. I don’t want to kill innocent people, but Israel is fighting not just Hamas, but the infrastructure around Hamas.”

Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum Saturday, Austin said he has “personally pushed Israeli leaders to avoid civilian casualties, and to shun irresponsible rhetoric, and to prevent violence by settlers in the West Bank, and to dramatically expand access to humanitarian aid.”

“You see, in this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat,” Austin said.

Graham, on “State of the Union,” disagreed: “Strategic defeat would be inflaming the Palestinians? They’re already inflamed. They are taught from the time they’re born to hate the Jews and to kill them.”

The South Carolina Republican said the retired Army general and former commander of US Central Command “is telling Israel things that are impossible to achieve” and called on Austin to “quit criticizing Israel in public.”

“Secretary Austin, the reason Palestinians are dying: Gaza is so condensed, Hamas has tunnels under apartments, under schools, under hospitals,” Graham said.

Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed at least 15,207 people and injured at least 40,652 others, Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza, saidSaturday.

He added that he understands the theory of what retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal has called “insurgent math,” an idea that collateral civilian death in warfare can be a catalyst for creating insurgents, but argued Gaza’s population “has been radicalized for decades.”

“If we were attacked like this, which we were in 9/11, if somebody called for us within two months to have a ceasefire against al-Qaeda, we would’ve laughed them out of town,” he said.

Graham also criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, who on Saturday during a news conference in Dubai said that “too many innocent Palestinians have been killed” as she met with the leaders of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan during her trip to the COP28 climate summit.

Graham questioned, “What is too many people dying in World War II after Pearl Harbor?”

“Vice President Harris, tell Israel how to destroy Hamas in a way not to hurt innocent Palestinians, and I’ll pass it along,” he said.

“No Republican believes this, by the way,” he added. “No Republican is telling Israel to change your military tactics.”","['civilian', 'sen', 'lloyd', 'austin', 'hamas', 'palestinians', 'graham', 'israel', 'sec', 'population', 'defense', 'confidence', 'republican', 'called', 'gaza', 'innocent', 'lost']","CNN —GOP Sen.

67,Johnson moves to corral GOP hardliners as tension grows in ranks,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had a bone to pick with the new speaker.

Ahead of the Thanksgiving recess, the Georgia Republican was frustrated that GOP lawmakers helped defeat her effort to force a vote on impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. And Greene – who has publicly insulted her Republican colleagues over their opposition to impeachment – also told CNN she was concerned about a “very serious situation” she experienced with an unnamed “male Republican of the conference,” declining to go into further details.

Normally, she would march straight into former Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s office, where she often got swift results. But Greene said she had a tougher time connecting with Speaker Mike Johnson, who doesn’t have a strong relationship with the congresswoman. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, was supposed to call her before the holiday break to listen to her concerns, according to Greene, but never did.

“I haven’t heard much from him,” Greene told CNN earlier this week.

The pair ultimately connected on Thursday ahead of another divisive vote she was planning to force on removing Mayorkas. Greene said Johnson heard her out and gave her assurances that her impeachment articles would move through committee and on to the floor. Greene then opted to pull her Mayorkas impeachment resolution – at least for now.

The episode involving Greene, the full details of which have not been previously reported, illustrates how Johnson is still learning how to wrangle the hardliners in his conference – a crucial skill for governing over a rambunctious and razor-thin majority that just got even smaller after the expulsion of indicted former Rep. George Santos. Taking a page from his predecessor’s playbook, Johnson has tried to dole out commitments and face-time to some of his potential critics. But so far, the speaker’s strategy has had mixed results.

After GOP Rep. Max Miller gave a searing public rebuke of Johnson’s recent decision-making on an Israel aid package, the speaker tried to arrange a sit-down meeting with the freshman lawmaker, presumably to smooth things over, according to sources familiar with the situation.

The Ohio Republican, however, has rebuffed Johnson’s entreaties, telling CNN he is “very upset.”

“I have chosen not to talk to him at this moment in time. He’s got his hands full with other things and until he can show me that he can lead I’m not going to waste my time sitting down with him,” Miller said.

Asked to give Johnson a grade on his performance, he said he’d give him a “D-minus. I’ve lost a lot of faith so far.”

And then there’s Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus who has continued to create headaches for Republican leaders with his outspoken criticism, questioning what his own party has accomplished since taking the majority.

When asked how Johnson has tried to handle the situation, Roy told CNN: “We’re still having conversations. The question here is what’s going to end up being delivered, but you know, we’ll see.”

But in other instances, Johnson has had success in taming some of the party’s loudest rebels – a sign that the speaker, who himself hails from the conservative wing of the party, has the ability to make inroads where McCarthy could not.

GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida – who led the charge to oust McCarthy as speaker – was among those personally pushing Johnson to sign off on subpoenas for Hunter and James Biden and publicly release the footage from the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, according to sources familiar with the situation. Those early moves from Johnson earned swift applause from Gaetz and the right flank.

And GOP Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, signaled this week they would no longer demand the $1.47 trillion topline spending number the caucus had been seeking all summer, saying they’d be amenable to the $1.59 trillion number agreed to in the bipartisan debt limit deal that enraged conservatives and helped lead to McCarthy’s ouster. The group even held the House hostage for days until McCarthy agreed to back off the deal he cut with the White House to seek even deeper cuts, a decision that has led to the current impasse over government spending on Capitol Hill.

“Certainly some members of the Freedom Caucus allowed their hatred of Kevin McCarthy to cloud their judgment and that misjudgment on their part weakened the Republican Conference and as a result made it harder for us to deliver conservative wins,” said Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican. “So, yes, that McCarthy derangement was real.”

Veteran GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma acknowledged, “It’s a challenge around here, no matter who the speaker is.”

“There is a lot of different personalities. We have a lot of different groups and points of view in the conference,” he told CNN. “But I’m very pleased with how well he is handling it.”

Internal feuds on full display

One of Johnson’s chief challenges has been dealing with the feuds in his bitterly divided party, where members have been in open warfare with one another in the wake of McCarthy’s unprecedented ouster.

Greene has been among the most difficult for Johnson on that front, openly bashing her Republican colleagues and using procedural tools to force a series of floor votes on divisive issues – tactics that have rubbed her colleagues the wrong way and put her increasingly on an island inside the GOP.

“It’s not right. She’s not a team player,” Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican who represents a district in Nebraska won by President Joe Biden in 2020, told CNN. “It’s all about individual stuff. We have a speaker, a chairman, for a reason. We should respect their word.”

After her failed attempt to force a vote on impeaching Mayorkas, Greene lashed out at GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California on social media, using emojis to question his manhood for siding with Democrats to defeat the effort.

In an interview, Issa would not say if her tactics are helpful. “That’s really a question for the speaker. It’s a question for the majority leader. It’s a question for the whip.”

Asked if he would consider her a productive member, Issa smiled and said: “Well, she does do a lot.”

And Greene also criticized GOP Rep. Tom McClintock of California, who delivered a floor speech this week railing against Greene for being “reckless” and “shooting from the hip” with her tactics on impeachment.

“I would urge my colleagues not to undermine a legitimate impeachment inquiry with hyper partisan, hysterical bombast,” McClintock told CNN.

Greene, who was booted from the Freedom Caucus earlier this year for being too cozy with McCarthy, also repeatedly attacked Roy for opposing her resolution to censure Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib for attending an pro-Palestinian protest, which Greene referred to in her resolution as an “insurrection.”

But Greene – who McCarthy brought into the fold in an attempt to keep the congresswoman’s behavior in check – said she has no regrets about her feuds with her colleagues, a sign she has little intention of backing down.

“I’ll remind everyone that I didn’t come here to make friends,” Greene said. She said that any Republicans who are “upset could talk to me anytime they’d like.”

“My position will be that we need to be doing the jobs that we promised to our voters … instead of just talking tough on the campaign trail and then coming up here and falling apart,” Greene told CNN.

Meanwhile, there’s also some unhappiness with Johnson and the leadership team for voting against expelling Santos, even though GOP leaders did not whip the vote and encouraged members to vote their conscience.

“This is just another example of Republicans who can’t lead. And that’s really shameful,” Miller said. “The speaker and everyone in leadership knows that this man is a crook.”

Hardliners could still create headaches on spending

While the far right has signaled it is willing to soften some of their spending demands, funding will still be a sticky issue for Johnson in the months ahead.

The House GOP convened a conference meeting on Thursday morning, which has not been previously reported, to hash out their plans for upcoming spending issues – including how to handle a White House push for an Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and border security package.

GOP Rep. Bob Good of Virginia said the Freedom Caucus made clear to the speaker on Thursday what their expectations are. That includes keeping aid for Israel and Ukraine separated, a plan to cut spending and secure the border, and a commitment not to attach a reauthorization of a controversial surveillance program to the annual defense bill.

“It’s been an effective effort – in conference this morning, and in subsequent meetings that took place after conference – to let leadership know what to put some red lines on,” Good told CNN.

Roy, meanwhile, expressed his frustrations during the closed-door conference meeting, according to attendees.

“I think everyone’s on edge right now, frustration levels are higher,” California Rep. Mike Garcia said after the meeting on Thursday. “So we need to come together as a team regardless of how frustrated we are.”

Before Thanksgiving, Roy gave an impassioned speech on the House floor where he demanded his GOP colleagues give him “one thing” Republicans have done since reclaiming the House majority – comments that infuriated Republican lawmakers and gave instant ammunition to Democrats.

This week, Roy doubled down on his position, and organized a “power hour” of speeches on the House floor to continue airing his grievances. But he also made clear his beef is not personal.

“Mike is one of the finest human beings I know. He’s a good man, he’s a conservative.” Roy told CNN. “Look, whoever is in the seat has got to figure out how to manage all of this. That’s the job. So, he’ll figure it out.”","['ranks', 'mccarthy', 'speaker', 'rep', 'gop', 'corral', 'tension', 'hardliners', 'republican', 'moves', 'greene', 'told', 'johnson', 'house', 'conference', 'grows']","But Greene said she had a tougher time connecting with Speaker Mike Johnson, who doesn’t have a strong relationship with the congresswoman.

68,Shoes and germs: Should you ask your party guests to go barefoot?,"Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.

CNN —

At-home holiday parties are on many people’s calendars right now, and germ-conscious hosts are faced with a dilemma: Should I require my guests to take off their shoes at the door, especially if the gathering is cocktail or formal attire — or the guest is a stylish shoeaholic like Carrie Bradshaw?

In a 2003 “Sex and the City” episode, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is asked to leave her $485 Manolo Blahnik shoes at the door during a New York City baby shower hosted by her friend Kyra (Tatum O’Neal) and soon finds they have been stolen.

“I hadn’t even done a full lap around the party,” Carrie lamented later at a lunch with her friends. The iconic TV character had been forced to walk home in her party dress and old gray sneakers lent by her host.

“Why in the h*ll did you take off your shoes to begin with?” asked Carrie’s friend Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall).

“We had to!” Carrie explained. “For their kids — apparently we drag things in on our heels that make children sick.”

While the episode, “A Woman’s Right to Shoes,” was designed to discuss dilemmas facing single people in a world focused on families with children, the underlying question — and debate — around footwear and health remains: Is there significant evidence going shoeless stops the spread of germs in a home?

“Absolutely,” said Gabriel Filippelli, chancellor’s professor for the department of Earth sciences at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and executive director of Indiana University’s Environmental Resilience Institute.

“We can track in all sorts of bacteria, but certainly some of the ones we’re most concerned about are E. coli that cause severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting,” he said. “There’s been studies that swab the bottom of shoes and something like 99% of the shoes test positive for fecal material.”

Heavy metals and more

However, bacteria are not the only danger that rides along with the dust and dirt surrounding rural and urban homes, gardens and parks, said Jill Litt, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado in Boulder who is currently working as a senior researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, or ISGlobal, in Spain.

“Studies have shown that in urban areas where there are older homes, lead in dust can be tracked into the home on the surface of shoes,” she said. “Other studies have shown that you can bring in pesticide residues from gardens via shoes.”

Heavy metals like lead and copper and zinc permeate the soils of urban parks and streets from decades of pollutants, while pesticide levels can be high in rural agricultural areas, Litt added.

Homes built before 1978 are very likely to contain lead-based paint, which can chip, peel and disintegrate into dangerous dust, experts say. There is no safe level of lead at any age, but children are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of heavy metals and pesticides due to their small size and proximity to contaminants as they crawl, roll and play on the floors of the home.

“For little ones, hand to mouth is one of the primary ways children get exposed to toxic substances and infectious disease agents,” said Litt, who is also a leader of Reimagining Environments for Connection and Engagement: Testing Actions for Social Prescribing in Natural Spaces. Funded by the European Union, the project aims to fight loneliness with natural spaces.

Wet mop first

Before you ask folks to take off their shoes, be sure the home is as dust-free as possible, experts say. Never vacuum or sweep with a broom first, as that will only stir up all the toxins, sending them airborne. Instead, reach for the wet or spray mop. As counterintuitive as it may be to add water to dirt, it’s actually the best way to remove toxins, Litt said.

The same goes for any horizontal surface, Filippelli said, but stay away from feather dusters. “Do more regular cleaning of horizontal surfaces with a damp cloth — that’s windowsills, tables, coffee tables, chair bottoms, chair seats and other furniture in addition to the floor.”

Use the “three-bucket” method if you live in an older home with lead paint or an area with high levels of lead outside. Have one bucket ready with an all-purpose cleaning solution, another to rinse and an empty bucket.

“Some folks also use a very weak vinegar solution in their wash water, which works really well,” Filippelli said. “There are some super sterilizers on the market, but when cleaners are really good at killing bacteria, they’re usually not very good for us as human beings. Whenever you can smell a superstrong smell from something, you got to at least think twice about it.”

Dip your mop into the cleaning solution, squeeze the excess water into the empty bucket, and begin to mop, starting from the farthest point from the door. Work toward the door, using the clean water as a rinse as you go. Flush water into the toilet when it looks dirty or with each new room — don’t throw it outside.

“The highest concentration of germs is in the interior entry way and levels go down as you move greater distances from this area,” Litt said. “Carpeting retains a lot of dust so that would be one thing I would remove if you had concerns about dusts and potential health concerns.”

Carpeted areas should be vacuumed with a device that has a high-efficiency particulate air, or HEPA, filter, not bagless vacuums, and throw the bag or filter away in an outside trash can when done.

Honor cold feet

Taking off shoes at the door may be the best way to limit germs and potentially toxic dust from coming inside, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t think of your guests’ comfort, Filippelli said. Providing washable slippers or nonslip socks can be a thoughtful gesture.

“I do not like to walk around with bare feet inside, so here’s my hack. I have some warm slippers right inside my front door — a lot of other cultures do that as well,” he said.

“Go to any Asian household, or even a Middle Eastern one and there’s often a little cubby right inside the door with washable slippers. You’re supposed to take your shoes off there and take the slippers and put those on.”

Would that have solved Carrie’s shoe-removal problems? No, those were taken care of when she asked Kyra to buy new Manolo’s as a gift for Carrie’s impending marriage — to herself.

“That’s all she registered for?” Kyra asked the salesperson, as her kids ran around the swanky Manolo Blahnik store on Madison Avenue.","['guests', 'litt', 'lead', 'water', 'slippers', 'party', 'right', 'germs', 'door', 'dust', 'carrie', 'shoes', 'barefoot', 'ask', 'asked']","“I hadn’t even done a full lap around the party,” Carrie lamented later at a lunch with her friends.

69,‘The Brick’ is at the center of our galaxy. An unexpected new finding may help unlock its mysteries,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

A box-shaped cloud of opaque dust that lies at the center of our galaxy has long perplexed scientists, and observations that reveal a new detail about its composition are deepening the mystery — possibly upending what’s known about how stars form.

The cloud, nicknamed “the Brick” for its visual impenetrability and rectangular appearance, was previously estimated to hold more than 100,000 times the mass of the sun. And such a dense blob should be churning out massive new stars, based on researchers’ current understanding of star formation.

But it’s not.

The Brick is largely dormant. And the latest observations, made using the James Webb Space Telescope, did not reveal any hidden, young stars.

The new Webb data instead unveiled that the Brick is not just made up of gas. It’s also littered with frozen carbon monoxide — much more than previously expected — according to a study published Monday in The Astrophysical Journal. And there’s more ice forming deeper into the Brick.

The findings could have drastic implications for how scientists analyze this region going forward. More carbon monoxide ice inside the Brick could dramatically change how researchers study and measure dark clouds in the center of the Milky Way.

“We are (now) closer to understanding what exactly is happening in the Brick and where the mass is,” said University of Florida astronomer Adam Ginsburg, lead author of the study. “But we opened more questions than we closed with this.”

Among those questions: Why and where is this carbon monoxide freezing into ice?

Other mysteries that loom for this region remain unanswered as well: Why can’t we see any new stars forming? Is the Brick not as dense as scientists once believed? And what are the strange ridge- and filament-like features that show up within the Brick?

“We have more to investigate before we can really be sure what’s going on,” Ginsburg said. “I would say we’re in the hypothesis-forming phase, not the drawing conclusions phase.”

What Webb revealed

Ginsburg and his fellow researchers, which included University of Florida graduate students, first got their hands on this new Webb data in September 2022.

It was a crucial moment. As the most powerful space telescope ever constructed, Webb could offer never-before-seen insights into the Brick. But right off the bat, Ginsburg and his team found the data needed a lot of work. The Webb telescope orients itself using a map, determining which direction it’s pointing by referencing where it is in relation to known stars.

The trouble was, “there’s so many stars at the galactic center that it gets confused,” Ginsburg said. So, researchers had to spend months cleaning up the data, orienting it to line up correctly with the existing maps of the sky.

Then, as they peered at the Brick, they found that the images from Webb were turning out the wrong color.

“All the stars were coming out a bit too blue,” Ginsburg said, prompting researchers to wonder if something was wrong with the data.

But it turned out, he said, the problem was with their assumptions. The scientists hadn’t expected there to be so much carbon monoxide ice — and that was the cause of the color change, according to the study.

Learning of the existence of the ice could have broad ripple effects for all kinds of research into the center of the Milky Way, said Dr. Natalie Butterfield, an assistant scientist at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, who was not involved in the study.

Butterfield said her own research — which includes studying supernovae and the radiation between star systems — could be forever altered by understanding the existence of this carbon monoxide ice. It could change how scientists estimate the mass of all the clouds in the galactic center.

Why carbon monoxide matters

There are several perplexing things about all this carbon monoxide ice. For instance, the area is fairly warm — around 60 Kelvin (minus 351.67 degrees Fahrenheit) — while carbon monoxide typically freezes at 20 Kelvin.

It could be that the dust inside the Brick is much colder than the gas, causing the carbon monoxide around the dust particles to turn solid. Or, Ginsburg said, it could be that water is freezing, trapping carbon monoxide inside.

The answer matters.

All the ice in a region such as the Brick can give scientists new insight into our solar system — even our home planet.

The ice and water that exist on Earth, for example, likely arrived here via comets. So, where ice exists in the universe and how it forms can help researchers understand where these comets come from and how they collected the materials they deposited.

Where are the stars?

And then there is the big mystery of why there is a lack of star formation within the Brick.

Scientists already know that new stars are brewed from dust clouds and hydrogen molecules. But scientists cannot directly observe hydrogen molecules within the Brick — or anywhere else in the universe — because they’re invisible to telescopes.

However, scientists also know that for every hydrogen molecule, there’s likely a certain amount of carbon monoxide. And carbon monoxide is visible — so scientists can measure it as a proxy for identifying how many hydrogen molecules are in a given area.

Researchers have been using this method for measuring hydrogen molecules for 50 years, Ginsburg said.

But they’ve always assumed the carbon monoxide was gas — not solid ice, as the Webb data revealed. This finding opens a whole new can of worms, Ginsburg said.

Ginsburg noted that it’s crucial for researchers to understand what state of matter the carbon monoxide is in — gas or solid — to arrive at the right answers.

Every new piece of knowledge about the Brick and its makeup better informs why this opaque cloud isn’t producing stars, even though — by most accounts — it should be one of the most active star nurseries in the galaxy.

“It’s a really natural place for new stars,” Ginsburg said. “But we haven’t found very many — only a very, very tiny handful.”

There are some possible answers that Ginsburg and other researchers are anxious to explore: Perhaps the Brick is more spread out — less compact — than scientists once thought. Or maybe it’s just too young, and its star-forming days are ahead.

Those are questions, Ginsburg and Butterfield said, that Webb can continue to help researchers answer.

“It’s just an impressive, impressive telescope,” Butterfield said. “I think this is just the first of many unique results that will be coming out of the JWST for the galactic center.”","['galaxy', 'mysteries', 'center', 'webb', 'carbon', 'unlock', 'unexpected', 'researchers', 'stars', 'monoxide', 'ice', 'brick', 'telescope', 'scientists', 'ginsburg', 'help', 'finding']","It’s also littered with frozen carbon monoxide — much more than previously expected — according to a study published Monday in The Astrophysical Journal.

70,Scientists reveal new insights into mysterious baboon mummies of ancient Egypt,"CNN —

To date, tens of millions of animal mummies have been unearthed in Egypt. But while there are millions of mummified cats, dogs, ibises and birds of prey, primate mummies are rare — and little understood.

Now, new analysis of mummified baboons is shedding light on the animals’ place in ancient Egypt, revealing that, while they were prized as sacred animals, their living conditions were less than ideal.

Researchers analyzed bones from mummified baboons, which were discovered in the early 1900s in the necropolis Gabbanat el-Qurud, in the so-called Valley of the Monkeys, to the southwest of Egypt’s Valley of the Kings. The bones represented dozens of individual baboons — from infants to adults — in two species: the hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas) and the olive baboon (Papio anubis).

These species weren’t native to Egypt — they were imported from two regions: “the olive baboon from the south (present-day Sudan), and the hamadryas baboon from mountainous areas bordering the Red Sea, in Sudan and southwards to Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia,” said lead study author Wim Van Neer, a professor emeritus at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels. “The exact provenances still need to be documented in more detail,” Van Neer told CNN in an email.

Of all the animals that the ancient Egyptians venerated, baboons were the only ones not native to Egypt, Van Neer added.

The baboons are thought to have played a role in ancient Egyptian rituals, the scientists reported Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. But raising and caring for large wild animals — particularly non-native species — is challenging. Before their deaths the baboons were sunlight-deprived and developed bone ailments from poor nutrition, researchers discovered. Examination of the skeletal remains revealed signs of rickets; the baboons had deformed arms, legs and faces, undeveloped teeth, osteoarthritis and other pathologies due to deprivation and metabolic disease.

Their deformities resembled those seen in the bones of baboons from two other ancient Egyptian sites — Saqqara and Tuna el-Gebel — dating to around the same period, the authors wrote.

“This excellently crafted and executed study confirms the results of some earlier investigations concerning the health status of baboons in ancient Egypt,” said Dr. Salima Ikram, a Distinguished University Professor of Egyptology from the American University of Cairo, who was not involved in the research. “More importantly, it also establishes the fact that different types of baboons were being brought to and reared in Egypt,” Ikram told CNN in an email. “It is fascinating to think that the ancient Egyptians tried to institute a breeding programme for baboons so that they could both be revered as well as used in religious rituals.”

A jumble of bones

At the three main Egyptian sites where mummies of Old World monkeys were interred, 463 mummified primates have been discovered, according to the study. The baboon bones examined for the new analysis were collected in 1905 and 1906 by archaeologists from the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle de Lyon in France (now the Musée des Confluences).

In the tombs were pieces of dried skin with long tufts of hair still attached, suggesting that the animals had been placed there as mummies. The French archaeologists recovered 23 skulls, 24 mandibles and more than 200 isolated bones, which were assembled into complete skeletons regardless of whether all the bones belonged to the same baboon, according to the study.

Two skeletons had been cobbled together from bones belonging to two different baboons, and one skeleton represented three of the primates. Of the four skeletons that were properly put together, only one had the correct skull. After analyzing the bones one by one, the study authors identified 36 different baboons of all ages, a set with more adults than juveniles and a few more males than females.

The bones also revealed signs of metabolic problems during adolescent growth, including curved shafts, misshapen shaft heads and arthritic joints. Two female baboons had suffered from tooth decay. There were lesions in some of the skulls; two of the primates had shortened snouts, and two others had snouts that bent to the left.

The mummies were also centuries older than previously thought. Based on the mummies’ proximity to nearby ceramic artifacts in the tombs, earlier estimates placed them between the first and second centuries at the earliest, and possibly as recent as the seventh century.

But when the study authors examined bone collagen and fibers from a textile that had been wrapped around an intact baboon mummy, they found that the animals were likely entombed between 803 and 520 BC. The researchers confirmed that time frame using a technique called radiocarbon dating, which can determine the age of organic material by measuring the amount of decay in a radioactive isotope of carbon.

The baboons' skeletal remains revealed signs of deformities, undeveloped teeth, osteoarthritis and other pathologies resulting from deprivation and disease. B. De Cupere

Sacred and suffering

Conditions for the captive primates may have been even worse than their remains suggested, as bones often don’t preserve records of parasites and other types of ailments, the researchers reported.

However, it’s important to note the scientists’ findings don’t suggest that the baboons were being intentionally abused. Their keepers likely did the best that they could to care for the animals, “but this must not have been easy,” Van Neer said.

“Baboons are good climbers and they were therefore probably kept in buildings or enclosures with high walls to prevent them from escaping. Because of the lack of sunlight they developed the metabolic disorders that we see, mainly rickets. There are no signs of broken bones that would suggest the animals were ill-treated physically,” he said.

“Unfortunately, the Egyptians did not know enough about the care and feeding of baboons,” Ikram added. “While trying to give them reverence and care they actually established conditions detrimental to the health and well-being of the animals — the way to hell is paved with good intentions!”

71,Superbug crisis: How a woman saved her husband's life,"CNN —

In February 2016, infectious disease epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee was holding her dying husband’s hand, watching him lose an exhausting fight against a deadly superbug infection.

After months of ups and downs, doctors had just told her that her husband, Tom Patterson, was too racked with bacteria to live.

“I told him, ‘Honey, we’re running out of time. I need to know if you want to live. I don’t even know if you can hear me, but if you can hear me and you want to live, please squeeze my hand.’

“All of a sudden, he squeezed really hard. And I thought, ‘Oh, great!’ And then I’m thinking, ‘Oh, crap! What am I going to do?’”

Strathdee would place cool cloths on her husband's forehead during his extended illness to try to break his many fevers. Steffanie Strathdee

What she accomplished next could easily be called miraculous. First, Strathdee found an obscure treatment that offered a glimmer of hope — fighting superbugs with phages, viruses created by nature to eat bacteria.

Then she convinced phage scientists around the country to hunt and peck through molecular haystacks of sewage, bogs, ponds, the bilge of boats and other prime breeding grounds for bacteria and their viral opponents. The impossible goal: quickly find the few, exquisitely unique phages capable of fighting a specific strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria literally eating her husband alive.

Next, the US Food and Drug Administration had to greenlight this unproven cocktail of hope, and scientists had to purify the mixture so that it wouldn’t be deadly.

Yet just three weeks later, Strathdee watched doctors intravenously inject the mixture into her husband’s body — and save his life.

Their story is one of unrelenting perseverance and unbelievable good fortune. It’s a glowing tribute to the immense kindness of strangers. And it’s a story that just might save countless lives from the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant superbugs — maybe even your own.

“It’s estimated that by 2050, 10 million people per year — that’s one person every three seconds — is going to be dying from a superbug infection,” Strathdee told an audience at Life Itself, a 2022 health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN.

“I’m here to tell you that the enemy of my enemy can be my friend. Viruses can be medicine.”

A terrifying vacation

During a Thanksgiving cruise on the Nile in 2015, Patterson was suddenly felled by severe stomach cramps. When a clinic in Egypt failed to help his worsening symptoms, Patterson was flown to Germany, where doctors discovered a grapefruit-size abdominal abscess filled with Acinetobacter baumannii, a virulent bacterium resistant to nearly all antibiotics.

Found in the sands of the Middle East, the bacteria were blown into the wounds of American troops hit by roadside bombs during the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname “Iraqibacter.”

“Veterans would get shrapnel in their legs and bodies from IED explosions and were medevaced home to convalesce,” Strathdee told CNN, referring to improvised explosive devices. “Unfortunately, they brought their superbug with them. Sadly, many of them survived the bomb blasts but died from this deadly bacterium.”

Today, Acinetobacter baumannii tops the World Health Organization’s list of dangerous pathogens for which new antibiotics are critically needed.

“It’s something of a bacterial kleptomaniac. It’s really good at stealing antimicrobial resistance genes from other bacteria,” Strathdee said. “I started to realize that my husband was a lot sicker than I thought and that modern medicine had run out of antibiotics to treat him.”

With the bacteria growing unchecked inside him, Patterson was soon medevaced to the couple’s hometown of San Diego, where he was a professor of psychiatry and Strathdee was the associate dean of global health sciences at the University of California, San Diego.

“Tom was on a roller coaster — he’d get better for a few days, and then there would be a deterioration, and he would be very ill,” said Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, a leading infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who was a longtime friend and colleague. As weeks turned into months, “Tom began developing multi-organ failure. He was sick enough that we could lose him any day.”

Searching for a needle in a haystack

After that reassuring hand squeeze from her husband, Strathdee sprang into action. Scouring the internet, she had already stumbled across a study by a Tbilisi, Georgia, researcher on the use of phages for treatment of drug-resistant bacteria.

A phone call later, Strathdee discovered phage treatment was well established in former Soviet bloc countries but had been discounted long ago as “fringe science” in the West.

“Phages are everywhere. There’s 10 million trillion trillion — that’s 10 to the power of 31 — phages that are thought to be on the planet,” Strathdee said. “They’re in soil, they’re in water, in our oceans and in our bodies, where they are the gatekeepers that keep our bacterial numbers in check. But you have to find the right phage to kill the bacterium that is causing the trouble.”

Buoyed by her newfound knowledge, Strathdee began reaching out to scientists who worked with phages: “I wrote cold emails to total strangers, begging them for help,” she said at Life Itself.

One stranger who quickly answered was Texas A&M University biochemist Ryland Young. He’d been working with phages for over 45 years.

“You know the word persuasive? There’s nobody as persuasive as Steffanie,” said Young, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics who runs the lab at the university’s Center for Phage Technology. “We just dropped everything. No exaggeration, people were literally working 24/7, screening 100 different environmental samples to find just a couple of new phages.”

‘No problem’

While the Texas lab burned the midnight oil, Schooley tried to obtain FDA approval for the injection of the phage cocktail into Patterson. Because phage therapy has not undergone clinical trials in the United States, each case of “compassionate use” required a good deal of documentation. It’s a process that can consume precious time.

But the woman who answered the phone at the FDA said, “‘No problem. This is what you need, and we can arrange that,’” Schooley recalled. “And then she tells me she has friends in the Navy that might be able to find some phages for us as well.”

In fact, the US Naval Medical Research Center had banks of phages gathered from seaports around the world. Scientists there began to hunt for a match, “and it wasn’t long before they found a few phages that appeared to be active against the bacterium,” Strathdee said.

Back in Texas, Young and his team had also gotten lucky. They found four promising phages that ravaged Patterson’s antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a test tube. Now the hard part began — figuring out how to separate the victorious phages from the soup of bacterial toxins left behind.

“You put one virus particle into a culture, you go home for lunch, and if you’re lucky, you come back to a big shaking, liquid mess of dead bacteria parts among billions and billions of the virus,” Young said. “You want to inject those virus particles into the human bloodstream, but you’re starting with bacterial goo that’s just horrible. You would not want that injected into your body.”

Purifying phage to be given intravenously was a process that no one had yet perfected in the US, Schooley said, “but both the Navy and Texas A&M got busy, and using different approaches figured out how to clean the phages to the point they could be given safely.”

More hurdles: Legal staff at Texas A&M expressed concern about future lawsuits. “I remember the lawyer saying to me, ‘Let me see if I get this straight. You want to send unapproved viruses from this lab to be injected into a person who will probably die.’ And I said, “Yeah, that’s about it,’” Young said.

“But Stephanie literally had speed dial numbers for the chancellor and all the people involved in human experimentation at UC San Diego. After she calls them, they basically called their counterparts at A&M, and suddenly they all began to work together,” Young added.

“It was like the parting of the Red Sea — all the paperwork and hesitation disappeared.”

‘It was just miraculous’

The purified cocktail from Young’s lab was the first to arrive in San Diego. Strathdee watched as doctors injected the Texas phages into the pus-filled abscesses in Patterson’s abdomen before settling down for the agonizing wait.

“We started with the abscesses because we didn’t know what would happen, and we didn’t want to kill him,” Schooley said. “We didn’t see any negative side effects; in fact, Tom seemed to be stabilizing a bit, so we continued the therapy every two hours.”

Two days later, the Navy cocktail arrived. Those phages were injected into Patterson’s bloodstream to tackle the bacteria that had spread to the rest of his body.

“We believe Tom was the first person to receive intravenous phage therapy to treat a systemic superbug infection in the US,” Strathdee told CNN.

“And three days later, Tom lifted his head off the pillow out of a deep coma and kissed his daughter’s hand. It was just miraculous.”

Damaged but not broken

Today, nearly eight years later, Patterson is happily retired, walking 3 miles a day and gardening. But the long illness took its toll: He was diagnosed with diabetes and is now insulin dependent, with mild heart damage and gastrointestinal issues that affect his diet.

“He isn’t back surfing again, because he can’t feel the bottoms of his feet, and he did get Covid-19 in April that landed him in the hospital because the bottoms of his lungs are essentially dead,” Strathdee said.

“As soon as the infection hit his lungs he couldn’t breathe and I had to rush him to the hospital, so that was scary,” she said. “He remains high risk for Covid but we’re not letting that hold us hostage at home. He says, ‘I want to go back to having as normal life as fast as possible.’”

To prove it, the couple are again traveling the world — they recently returned from a 12-day trip to Argentina.

“We traveled with a friend who is an infectious disease doctor, which gave me peace of mind to know that if anything went sideways, we’d have an expert at hand,” Strathdee said.

“I guess I’m a bit of a helicopter wife in that sense. Still, we’ve traveled to Costa Rica a couple of times, we’ve been to Africa, and we’re planning to go to Chile in January.”

A legacy

Patterson’s case was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in 2017, jump-starting new scientific interest in phage therapy.

“There’s been an explosion of clinical trials that are going on now in phage (science) around the world and there’s phage programs in Canada, the UK, Australia, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, India and China has a new one, so it’s really catching on,” Strathdee told CNN.

Some of the work is focused on the interplay between phages and antibiotics — as bacteria battle phages they often shed their outer shell to keep the enemy from docking and gaining access for the kill. When that happens, the bacteria may be suddenly vulnerable to antibiotics again.

“We don’t think phages are ever going to entirely replace antibiotics, but they will be a good adjunct to antibiotics. And in fact, they can even make antibiotics work better,” Strathdee said.

In San Diego, Strathdee and Schooley opened the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, or IPATH, in 2018, where they treat or counsel patients suffering from multidrug-resistant infections. The center’s success rate is high, with 82% of patients undergoing phage therapy experiencing a clinically successful outcome, according to its website.

Schooley is running a clinical trial using phages to treat patients with cystic fibrosis who constantly battle Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a drug-resistant bacteria that was also responsible for the recent illness and deaths connected to contaminated eye drops manufactured in India.

And a memoir the couple published in 2019 — “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug” — is also spreading the word about these “perfect predators” to what may soon be the next generation of phage hunters.

“I am getting increasingly contacted by students, some as young as 12,” Strathdee said. “There’s a girl in San Francisco who begged her mother to read this book and now she’s doing a science project on phage-antibiotic synergy, and she’s in eighth grade. That thrills me.”

Strathdee is quick to acknowledge the many people who helped save her husband’s life. But those who were along for the ride told CNN that she and Patterson made the difference.

“I think it was a historical accident that could have only happened to Steffanie and Tom,” Young said. “They were at UC San Diego, which is one of the premier universities in the country. They worked with a brilliant infectious disease doctor who said, ‘Yes,’ to phage therapy when most physicians would’ve said, ‘Hell, no, I won’t do that.’

“And then there is Steffanie’s passion and energy — it’s hard to explain until she’s focused it on you. It was like a spiderweb; she was in the middle and pulled on strings,” Young added. “It was just meant to be because of her, I think.”","['phages', 'saved', 'bacteria', 'patterson', 'young', 'life', 'schooley', 'woman', 'superbug', 'strathdee', 'phage', 'san', 'told', 'diego', 'crisis', 'husbands']","Yet just three weeks later, Strathdee watched doctors intravenously inject the mixture into her husband’s body — and save his life.

72,"Who came out on top, and who lost out from the OpenAI leadership crisis?","CNN —

The leadership crisis that engulfed OpenAI for nearly a week ended almost as abruptly as it began: With a terse, cryptic announcement by the company that would have enormous ramifications for its future.

In some ways, the outcome was a return to the status quo: Sam Altman would be restored as CEO, with the company’s deep and lucrative business partnership with Microsoft, which took a $13 billion stake in the company even as it ramps up its own AI research efforts, left intact.

But in other ways, the agreement is still a watershed moment for OpenAI and the artificial intelligence field writ large.

The tumultuous week seems to have resulted in a big victory for Altman personally; proponents of widespread AI adoption; and some of the country’s most established elites. And it came at the expense of AI skeptics who, by many accounts, bungled an attempt to make a principled stand for caution about the technology’s long-term risks.

Who came out on top

Sam Altman A clear winner in the whole debacle is, of course, Altman himself. Unceremoniously ejected from his post on Friday, Altman quickly rallied support from the vast majority of OpenAI’s staff, who signed what was essentially a loyalty pledge underscoring the deep rift between himself and the board. His return to OpenAI, in triumph over the board that summarily fired him, reflects a kind of personal vindication that’s only likely to bolster, for better or for worse, his carefully and intentionally constructed image as a charismatic visionary who is single-handedly unlocking the secrets of the universe.

Microsoft Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has sought to downplay the tech giant’s part in the crisis, insisting on Monday — before Altman’s reappointment — that whatever happens with OpenAI, “nothing changes.” Microsoft’s priority, Nadella said, was to ensure uninterrupted delivery of AI technology to its own customers, whether that meant Altman being hired by Microsoft or his reinstallation at OpenAI.

But Microsoft is hardly a disinterested party, having committed billions to OpenAI in a multi-year partnership that’s led to the tech giant integrating ChatGPT into Bing search and other Microsoft products. Now, Microsoft is poised to gain even more influence. Nadella hinted at this reality on Monday, signaling that if Altman were to return as OpenAI’s CEO, Microsoft would have a very strong opinion on how the AI startup is governed.

“One thing I’ll be very, very clear [about] is, we’re never going to get back into a situation where we get surprised like this ever again,” Nadella said. “If we go back to operating like on Friday, we will make sure we are very, very clear that the governance gets fixed in a way that we really have more surety and guarantee that we don’t have surprises.”

Whether that could mean having a board observer or a full-fledged seat on OpenAI’s board, he said, is a bridge “we’ll cross… if it happens.”

New board members In naming ex-Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to OpenAI’s board, the agreement stands to align the company even more closely with the country’s wealthiest and most influential elite.

Taylor isn’t just a former CEO of one of the tech industry’s biggest companies. He’s a former chief technology officer of Facebook, and in 2022, as the chair of Twitter, successfully forced Elon Musk to follow through with his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company, in a momentous bit of corporate maneuvering.

Summers, meanwhile, is the former president of Harvard University who has attracted controversy for suggesting that “innate differences” are the reason for women’s underrepresentation in scientific professions. The remark was widely criticized as sexist and Summers subsequently apologized.

Who came out on bottom

The push to slow AI development In the same way that the deal breathes new life into Altman’s mythos, so does it give a tailwind to the ideology he represents: a belief in the rapid commercialization of generative AI. With some of the apparent architects of Altman’s ouster being pushed out themselves, a casualty of the affair may be the perspectives that those board members espoused. That seems to include a deep fear about the long-term, potentially even existential risks of AI.

In the letter signed by hundreds of OpenAI staffers threatening to quit, employees reported that board members claimed allowing the company to be destroyed “would be consistent with the mission” of OpenAI, which is to “ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”

That OpenAI’s board apparently believed the company’s destruction would benefit society reflects the concerns of a vocal camp in the AI field that has called for pauses in AI development, more research to “align” AI with human-centered values, and concerns about the unchecked power of a truly sentient super-intelligence. Emmett Shear, whom the board named OpenAI’s interim CEO for all of two days, has also expressed similar worries. In the fallout of the leadership crisis, some have argued that the outcome is also a defeat for effective altruism, the movement with which some OpenAI board members are said to be affiliated.

OpenAI does not appear to be on the brink of an all-out AI sprint that disregards risk entirely. Summers has been vocal about AI’s near-term impacts on labor. And after having wowed US lawmakers by calling for AI regulation, Altman will likely continue to be a prominent figure in the global debate over rules for artificial intelligence.

Still, deserved or not, the dispute appears to have done long-term damage to the credibility of certain deep skeptics of AI, and lifted the fortunes of the Microsofts and Altmans of the world who are pushing to get artificial intelligence into the hands of the public. And that may have untold ripple effects for AI development for years to come.","['altman', 'openai', 'board', 'microsoft', 'ceo', 'openais', 'came', 'company', 'summers', 'ai', 'nadella', 'leadership', 'crisis', 'lost']","CNN —The leadership crisis that engulfed OpenAI for nearly a week ended almost as abruptly as it began: With a terse, cryptic announcement by the company that would have enormous ramifications for its future.

73,Democrats accuse X of profiting from Hamas propaganda,"Washington CNN —

A group of House Democrats has accused X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, of profiting from Hamas propaganda and misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war after reports by independent researchers found numerous accounts glorifying the US-sanctioned terror group.

More than two dozen US lawmakers signed the letter dated Tuesday addressed to X owner Elon Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino.

Citing analyses by groups including the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, NewsGuard and the Tech Transparency Project, Tuesday’s letter said lawmakers were “outraged by the clear indicators that X is profiting from the spread of Hamas’s terrorist propaganda — both through monthly subscription fees collected from some propaganda spreaders, and through ads displayed in replies to posts by both Premium and regular accounts.”

One of the reports in question, published last month, claimed to have identified examples of paid X subscribers sharing videos bearing Hamas iconography and depicting violent or gruesome images. Another report claimed to have identified dozens of paid X subscriber accounts promoting “false or unsubstantiated narratives relating to the war” and that posts spreading the misinformation had been viewed at least 100 million times globally.

“Given X’s major cuts to content moderation staff over the last year, it appears that X has willfully permitted, and benefited from, the illegal spread of terrorist propaganda,” wrote the group, led by Reps. Adam Schiff of California, Daniel Goldman of New York and Jamie Raskin of Maryland. “Such behavior from one of the world’s most widely used social media platforms is wholly unacceptable.”

X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawmakers’ accusations.

A new report released by NewsGuard on Wednesday claimed that ads for 86 major advertisers, including Pizza Hut, Airbnb and Microsoft, were shown on viral posts that pushed false or misleading claims about the Israel-Hamas war. The posts were seen by a total of 92 million users on X, according to NewsGuard.

X released a statement in advance of the NewsGuard report’s publication, calling its findings into question. X could not be reached for further comment Wednesday evening.

On Tuesday, Musk abruptly announced that X would be donating “all revenue from advertising & subscriptions associated with the war in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza.” But it was unclear what content he was referring to and whether the announcement was directly related to the lawmakers’ letter. X Head of Business Operations Joe Benarroch declined to clarify the company’s plans beyond saying the donation would be “a sizeable amount.”

The pressure from House Democrats comes amid a wider blowback to X over extremist content on the platform, in some cases amplified directly by Musk himself. In recent days, X has suffered a notable exodus of high-profile advertisers following Musk’s public embrace of an antisemitic conspiracy theory popular with White supremacists and a report by Media Matters, the progressive media watchdog group, that said major brands’ advertisements appeared beside pro-Nazi content.

Musk sued Media Matters on Monday, accusing it of distorting the likelihood that ads may be shown against extremist material. But some legal critics have cast doubt on the complaint, calling it “weak” and “bogus” in the face of the First Amendment.

Tuesday’s letter also highlights the mounting public scrutiny of Yaccarino, who until now has sought to position herself as a cheery counterweight to Musk’s flirtation with far-right extremism. The letter calls for Yaccarino and Musk to answer by December 1 to allegations that X has amplified terrorist propaganda in violation of its own policies.

It comes a day after the Senate Judiciary Committee said it had enlisted the US Marshals Service, in a rare move, to serve Yaccarino with a subpoena personally, compelling her to testify at a December 6 hearing on children’s online safety. In a release, the committee said it was forced to take that extraordinary measure after X declined to accept the subpoena on Yaccarino’s behalf, in a “remarkable departure from typical practice.”","['hamas', 'terrorist', 'media', 'letter', 'posts', 'musk', 'yaccarino', 'democrats', 'lawmakers', 'propaganda', 'x', 'war', 'profiting', 'accuse']","Washington CNN —A group of House Democrats has accused X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, of profiting from Hamas propaganda and misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war after reports by independent researchers found numerous accounts glorifying the US-sanctioned terror group.

74,"Spotify to slash royalties for rain sounds, white noise and other non-music tracks","CNN —

Spotify’s new royalty system means so-called functional noises like the sound of rainfall will earn significantly less than traditional music files.

In an attempt to crack down on “bad actors” using the genre to fraudulently generate revenue, Spotify announced in a blog post Tuesday it would be increasing the minimum track length for functional noise recordings to two minutes, as well as valuing streams of the sounds at a “fraction of the value” of music track streams.

A sound featuring 30 seconds of white noise has thus far been worth the same as an artist’s original music track, creating a “revenue opportunity for noise uploaders well beyond their contribution to listeners,” according to Spotify, and creating frustration throughout the music industry.

Until now, creators of functional sounds have been able to game Spotify’s streaming system to maximize revenue with minimal effort. Since streaming royalties are paid out partly based on the amount of times a track is played and sounds like white noise are often listened to for hours, Spotify says creators are shortening sounds to as little as 30 seconds (the platform’s current minimum track length) and looping playlists so that the same clip gets listened to over and over again, bumping up streaming numbers and royalty cash outs.

While Spotify did not state how much the platform would be devaluing the streams, Billboard reported that functional tracks would now be worth one-fifth of their music counterparts.

The functional genre includes nature sounds, white noise, sound effects and silence recordings.

“It can’t be that an Ed Sheeran stream is worth exactly the same as a stream of rain falling on the roof,” Robert Kync, Warner Music Group CEO, said in a May earnings call, a sentiment echoed by other music executives.

“Obviously white noise is very different from ‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ but it, currently under this model, is paid the same,” Marina Guz, chief commercial officer at Endel, an AI-driven functional music company partnered with Universal Music Group, told CNN.

Guz explained that there has been rising pressure from labels and artists to change the way Spotify makes distinctions between functional noise and music.

“There’s been an ongoing conversation this entire year of the value of music and how something like someone just putting up white noise is different than paying for an artist that had spent a year in the studio making the album with all kinds of instruments and people involved,” Guz told CNN.

In another attempt to clamp down on malicious behavior, the platform announced Tuesday it is moving to charge labels and distributors by track when “flagrant” artificial streaming is suspected. Artificial streaming is when streams counts are increased fraudulently, such as through bots. The company is also making changes to its royalty system, moving to only compensate tracks that generate more than 1000 streams.

Spotify has also come under scrutiny for white noise podcasts, with Bloomberg reporting in 2023 that podcasts featuring only ambient sounds were accounting for three million daily consumption hours and accidentally being boosted by Spotify’s own algorithm, resulting in a $38 million loss in potential annual profits. Creators of such podcasts could reportedly rake in as much as $18,000 a month in ads, Bloomberg found in 2022.

Spotify’s changes will roll out early next year.","['royalties', 'streaming', 'music', 'nonmusic', 'worth', 'system', 'white', 'slash', 'track', 'noise', 'rain', 'tracks', 'spotify', 'functional', 'sounds']","A sound featuring 30 seconds of white noise has thus far been worth the same as an artist’s original music track, creating a “revenue opportunity for noise uploaders well beyond their contribution to listeners,” according to Spotify, and creating frustration throughout the music industry.

75,Jack Ma backs off on plans to sell Alibaba shares after stock plunge,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

Jack Ma has put off plans to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Alibaba shares after the Chinese tech giant’s stock plummeted last week.

Two regulatory filings from last Thursday revealed that Ma had been looking to offload 10 million shares, worth nearly $871 million.

But because the company’s stock price has fallen below the billionaire’s expectations, he has not sold “a single share,” according to a Wednesday post from Alibaba (BABA) Chief People Officer Jane Jiang Fang on the company’s internal forum seen by CNN.

The sales were initially planned to take place this Tuesday through JC Properties and JSP Investment, two entities linked to Ma and his philanthropic foundation, according to the filings.

The disclosure of the intended sales came the same day Alibaba reported third quarter earnings, when it announced that it would drop plans to spin off its cloud computing arm partly due to uncertainties caused by US controls on chip exports to China.

Alibaba’s stock plunged 9% in New York on Thursday and nearly 10% in Hong Kong on Friday, wiping out about $20 billion from the company’s market value.

So far this year, Alibaba’s shares have fallen more than 10%.

Jiang said the fact that both pieces of news came at the same time was just a “coincidence.”

The news of the sale had triggered rumors that Ma had lost confidence in the company, but Jiang urged employees to dismiss such speculation. The executive said the transactions were part of a long-term plan laid out in August, which would allow Ma’s office to invest in agricultural technology and welfare projects both in and outside China.

Ma believes that the Hangzhou-based firm’s stock “is currently significantly lower than Alibaba’s actual value, and he will not sell it,” she said.

Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai also weighed in, writing in a comment on the same post seen by CNN that he had “full confidence” in the company.

On Friday, Ma’s office told the South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong newspaper owned by Alibaba, that he remained “very positive” about the company’s prospects, despite plans for “a partial sell-down.”

Ma’s foundation and Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the matter, or whether the share sale would proceed if the company’s stock price rebounded.

The group is currently in the midst of a major restructuring, which was announced in March and originally intended to result in a split of six separate units, each overseen by its own chief executive and board of directors.

But last week, Alibaba said it would rethink plans not just for its cloud business, but for a listing of its grocery chain Freshippo, citing a need to “evaluate market conditions.”

Ma founded Alibaba in 1999. He stepped down as chairman of the company in 2019, about a year before landing in hot water with Chinese authorities for criticizing Chinese financial regulators and banks. Since then, the entrepreneur has kept a relatively low profile while remaining an Alibaba shareholder.","['kong', 'plans', 'shares', 'backs', 'companys', 'stock', 'chinese', 'post', 'jack', 'ma', 'worth', 'alibaba', 'sell', 'plunge']","Hong Kong CNN —Jack Ma has put off plans to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Alibaba shares after the Chinese tech giant’s stock plummeted last week.

76,Solid state batteries promise to radically change EVs. But they may not be the only answer,"CNN —

Electric cars are supposed to be the future, but they still have issues that are keeping away many car buyers. The range is too short. The batteries are too heavy and expensive. They take too long to charge. But a number of companies say they have the technology to solve many — maybe even all — of these problems.

Toyota, in particular, has said it might be on the cusp of such a breakthrough. Other automakers are also working with various battery companies on versions of this new technology.

The would-be breakthrough is called a “solid state battery,” and the only problem is that — much like other vaunted Earth-changing technologies — for a few years now, it’s always been just a couple of years away.

Car companies including Stellantis, Hyundai and Volkswagen have also teamed up with firms working on solid state batteries. The technology holds the promise of batteries that are smaller and lighter while providing more power. They could be safer with less chance of catching fire in a crash, too.

But solid state technology has its own challenges, and it’s not the only way automakers could achieve lighter, cheaper and faster charging electric vehicles.

Battery basics

The main difference between a solid state battery and the lithium-ion batteries currently used in electric cars is a component known as the electrolyte. In a lithium-ion battery, the electrolyte is a gooey liquid. In a solid state battery, the electrolyte is, well, a solid. That solid electrolyte is one reason that solid state batteries might be safer than lithium-ion batteries. If a liquid electrolyte battery is broken or punctured, the two sides of the electrolyte can ooze together, which can lead to an uncontrolled energy flow, followed by a fire.

Generally speaking, solids are also denser than liquids meaning the electrolyte takes up less space and battery cells can be smaller. But some companies are working on other strategies, as well, that can make batteries still smaller and lighter and, also, faster charging.

The main challenge for all of these companies, and the automakers that have invested in them, is how to produce these hi-tech batteries economically in the sort of numbers needed to build affordable electric cars. Meanwhile, there are competing battery technologies for which manufacturing techniques are well established.

It’s a wide-open field right now with a number of start-up companies each working with different chemical combinations and even slightly different physical structures for their batteries. There’s still no clearly superior technology, said William Kephart, a battery researcher at the consulting firm P3 Group

Fast charging times, a key consumer demand, is one challenge for solid-state batteries. Generally, it takes the lithium ions in the batteries used currently more time to move through a rigid material than a liquid, Kephart said. That tends to make it take longer to receive energy, which slows charging times, and makes it slower to release energy — which drags on a vehicle’s acceleration.

Solid-state battery company Quantumscape claims that its solid-state batteries — which use some liquid, but not for the electrolyte — have been tested and can charge even faster than typical lithium ion batteries.

Solid-state batteries will tend to be more expensive because they contain more lithium, which is expensive, said Kephart. Lithium prices will come down as more sources are found and accessed, he said, but, compared to other batteries, solid-state batteries will tend to cost more.

A company called Factorial, which counts Stellantis and Mercedes as investors, claims its solid-state battery technology uses less lithium than traditional batteries, which could potentially reduce costs, especially as production ramps up.

“We think the costing actually will be competitive because lithium, just from the raw material perspective, it’s not a scarce material,” said Factorial chief executive Siyu Huang.

Quantumscape also say its battery design eliminates graphite, reducing expense and, the company claims, greatly reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing.

Other options

At the same time, though, some other battery companies are working to improve traditional liquid-electrolyte batteries, improvements that could make that existing technology better. Just changing the one piece of the battery by adding silicone could yield big improvements in performance at relatively low cost. That’s what’s proposed by a company called OneD Battery Sciences, in which GM has invested.

OneD’s technology allows production processes to stay roughly the same while promising big improvements in performance, according to the company. That means less trouble and expense for battery manufacturers and automakers.

Other companies are working on semi-solid state batteries that combine parts of each type of battery, providing some of the benefits of solid state without completely ditching the standard fluid-based design.

Ultimately, there probably will never be one battery technology used in all EVs, GM spokesperson Phil Lienert said. The type of batteries will be matched to the vehicle and the specific market where it’s sold. It’s similar to how automakers use different engines in various models and in different markets. GM’s Ultium electric vehicle design, which underlies all of GM’s EV models, was specifically engineered to enable the use of all different sorts of batteries.

“When you have a customer lineup as big and diverse as ours, you need to have multiple solutions that can coexist” within the same basic engineering, he said.","['batteries', 'electrolyte', 'solid', 'working', 'electric', 'technology', 'radically', 'promise', 'battery', 'lithium', 'answer', 'change', 'companies', 'state', 'evs']","Car companies including Stellantis, Hyundai and Volkswagen have also teamed up with firms working on solid state batteries.

That solid electrolyte is one reason that solid state batteries might be safer than lithium-ion batteries.

77,Brands that have paused ads on X amid ongoing crisis for Elon Musk’s platform,"New York CNN —

At least a dozen major brands have halted ad spending on X, formerly Twitter, since its latest advertiser exodus began last week over concerns about antisemitism and hate speech on Elon Musk’s social media platform.

Fox Sports, Ubisoft, Axios, TechCrunch and Paris Hilton’s 11:11 Media all told CNN in recent days that they’d paused their ad spending on X, joining other large advertisers that jumped ship last week.

The ongoing exit of advertisers marks a deepening crisis for X, which was already struggling to woo brands back to the platform following Musk’s takeover last year. And it comes as growing numbers of X users also decamp to alternate platforms. The White House joined Threads this week, giving a boost to Meta’s X competitor.

The latest revolt began last week when IBM said it had suspended advertising on X after a report from progressive media watchdog Media Matters found its ad had run alongside pro-Nazi content on the platform. IBM’s decision also came after Musk had publicly endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory in a post on X earlier in the week.

On Friday, a slew of major media brands including Disney, Paramount, Comcast, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal and CNN-parent Warner Bros. Discovery followed suit, although they did not specify their reasons for halting advertising on X. Apple also reportedly pulled its ad spend on X as of last week, according to reports from multiple news outlets.

X has called on its advertising partners to help protect what it calls “freedom of speech.” The company on Monday filed a lawsuit accusing Media Matters of misrepresenting how likely it is for ads to run alongside extremist content on the site. X also said it had made the pro-Nazi accounts identified by Media Matters ineligible for monetization, meaning ads can no longer be run on their pages. And CEO Linda Yaccarino has continued to tout brand safety controls that the company says can help prevent ads from running beside objectionable content. (Media Matters has vowed to fight the lawsuit from X and says it stands by its reporting.)

But the company has done little else to reassure advertisers that its platform is safe. The pro-Nazi accounts identified by Media Matters remain active on the site, along with other far-right and White supremacist accounts, some of whom Musk had reinstated on the platform following his takeover. CNN on Wednesday observed ads for the University of Michigan running on the page of the X account belonging to Richard Spencer, a known White nationalist. (A University of Michigan spokesperson told CNN the university is “watching developments on X closely as we continue to evaluate our use of the platform.”)

Musk this week also boosted the years-old, debunked “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory that in 2016 prompted a gun-wielding man to fire shots inside a Washington, D.C., pizza shop.

Some advertisers have remained on X despite the hate speech concerns. The National Football League — one of the platform’s biggest ad partners — told CNN Tuesday that it had repeatedly expressed concerns about hate speech to X leadership directly, although it has not pulled its spending from the platform.

78,"Michael Jordan’s ultra-private, ultra-exclusive personal golf course: The Grove XXIII","CNN —

There’s one small corner of the world that Michael Jordan cherishes more than any other — his own personal haven of sporting bliss.

But it’s not in Chicago. In fact, there isn’t a basketball court or hoop in sight.

Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts.

The Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it.

For Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.”

And there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994.

Almost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015.

With Tiger Woods headlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect.

A meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client.

“I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN.

“I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.”

The land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach.

Weed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week.

Weed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants. Watching Jordan in discussion with the team during one early meeting, he got the impression of a coach interacting with his players.

“I think one of his qualities is he was such a good listener, and he absorbed everything that you were discussing,” Weed said.

“He didn’t come out and say ‘do this or do that.’ He came out and observed and was a great listener, and he let me do my job.”

“Slaughterhouse 23”

Weed had his two pillars for a great golf course — an engaged owner and a good piece of property, though the latter would require some polishing.

Turning a flat, “featureless” site – bordered by two long drainage canals – into a cross between the manicured, parkland style of Augusta National and the rustic layout of Pine Valley represented the greatest challenge to him and his team.

Dirt was excavated from lagoons to build the course and its features, fixing the flatness issue and leaving behind six large lakes – the same number of NBA Championships Jordan won. It was a coincidence, but ultimately fit the theme of a course tuned to the finest degree to its owner’s style.

Jordan wanted firm and fast, a course that could both excite and challenge its members, many of whom would be among the PGA Tour’s current stars. A double-helix layout, with a “crossover” at the 5th and 14th holes, offers the flexibility to play continual internal circuits in three, six, or nine-hole loops – ideal for Jordan’s busy schedule.

The course didn’t just need to suit the playstyle of its owner, though, it needed to enhance it.

“You don’t think I’m going to spend this much money and not have a little bit of an advantage do you?” Weed recalled Jordan saying.

Add to that the five-time MVP’s penchant for wagers, which will be familiar to viewers of docuseries “The Last Dance,” and the course has earned a new name among some members: “Slaughterhouse 23.”

“It’s his golf course, so it’s set up very well for him,” former world No. 1 Rickie Fowler told the Subpar podcast in 2020.

Weed, too, got drawn into the wagers, even during construction.

“I can remember us being out there hitting shots and doing a little gambling while we were just playing in the dirt. It was just great fun and interaction,” he said.

“It’s hard not to go out there and play a round with MJ without having a friendly wager.”

To meet the second requirement of Jordan’s brief, Weed’s team set aside 20 acres to construct a state-of-the-art practice facility that the designer believes has no equal.

Two 400-yard, double-sided driving lanes can be maintained for specific conditions, such as US Open or PGA Tour style fairways, with “target greens” in 25-yard increments. Each green has built-in pods that can track swathes of shot information, incorporating the PGA Tour’s ShotLink data.

The putting green is split into four quadrants, with incremental slopes ranging from 0-1% to 3-4% inclines. Even the grass on the tees is customizable, with different types to mimic warm or cool seasons.

“It’s a Tour player’s haven to work on their game,” said Weed.

Taking a swing

Compared to Bobby Weed Golf Design, Nichols Architects had considerably less experience in golf courses, but it did have one key advantage in its efforts to beat other bids to build The Grove XXIII’s clubhouse.

Specializing in hospitality, residential, and commercial design, the firm had worked on the W South Beach in Miami — the favorite hotel of Jordan’s wife Yvette Prieto.

The team pulled no punches with its pitch to Jordan. “You’re not going to confuse this clubhouse with a clubhouse down the road or anything like that, and that’s what we’re selling you,” planning and design partner Igor Reyes told CNN of the pitching process, likening it to that depicted in the “Air” movie, where Nike must lure a rookie Jordan away from a deal with Adidas.

“You’ve really got to make an architectural iconic shape, and a shape that you could almost immediately feel was swinging across the landscape. Hopefully you can almost read the concept without anybody having to tell you,” Reyes said.

The deal clincher — outlined to Jordan in a pitch video — was that clubhouse shape, inspired by the smooth, “almost machine-like” perfection of a golf swing.

Reyes said his team had heard of Jordan’s purported early struggles with his swing, and, in the video, set up a column grid to map the building’s structure onto Tiger Woods’ club trajectory. Jordan was captivated, and told the firm there and then that it would get the contract.

“The first time you walk into the room with him, you don’t want to get too close or anything like that, it was kind of an odd thing,” Reyes said. “But by the second or third meeting we were just talking to him like a ‘regular’ client with a huge amount of respect.

“There was a really a sense of, ‘This isn’t just a guy with a lot of money that wants to do something. This guy knows what he’s doing, he knows what he likes, and how to get to it.’”

The elephant in the roof

Inside, 15,000 square feet of space leaves ample room for men’s and women’s lockers, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, kitchen and dining facilities, and even a shop. Hospitality was a priority, with a below-ground level meaning all service, as well as golf cart storage, can be managed from underneath.

Like the course, Jordan’s identity was stamped all over. Columns were set further inside below an overhanging roof to mimic the hang-time that inspired the “Air Jordan” tag, while an elephant print used on some of his shoes was incorporated into the fritted-glass roof, casting the print across the floor when the sun shines through.

Customization goes all the way down to Air Jordan logos on the ice cubes, as PGA Tour pro Jimmy Walker shared to Instagram after a round at the course in March 2021.

Like Weed, Reyes believes his job was made easier by an engaged client.

“He was involved with a lot of the decisions … we didn’t change a color without him knowing,” Reyes said.

“We have had work with other celebrity people and they won’t talk to you, it’s ‘I just want this’ and sort of like, ‘get out of the way.’ But he realized there was a lot of creativity going on and he wanted to be a part of it.”

“No other place I’d rather be”

Given Jordan’s regular on-site visits, there was no big reveal for the owner when the Grove XXIII officially opened in the fall of 2019, but there was a revelation when Weed joined him for his very first round.

When play finished, the architect found himself wrapped in a 6-foot, 6-inch bear hug.

“He looked at me and said, ‘I’m fortunate enough I can be anywhere in the world, but there’s no other place I’d rather be than right here,’” Weed recalled.

“That’s like the ultimate compliment … to have his own golf course and to shape and mold that golf course for him and his friends, it’s just where he wants to be. It’s just a great spot and evolved into something fantastic.

“He’s going to enjoy it as long as he’s playing and then it’s going to get passed along to the next generation — it’s just one of the great things about golf and why it has sustained itself over centuries.”","['bobby', 'weed', 'team', 'jordans', 'jordan', 'ultraexclusive', 'michael', 'xxiii', 'personal', 'shape', 'pga', 'course', 'design', 'ultraprivate', 'grove', 'golf']","Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course.

79,Six bull sharks inadvertently made their home on an Australian golf course. Then they vanished,"CNN —

For golfers, staying out of the water could be the difference between winning and losing. At one course in Australia, it was the difference between life and death.

Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks.

From their mysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard.

Arrival

A lake on a landlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats.

River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks have organs specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium.

Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s.

Neither did severe flooding.

Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions including in 1991, 1995 and 1996.

The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters.

As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013.

Carbrook’s Nessie

Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green.

There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast.

“The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN.

“It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.”

The presence of bull sharks (pictured, 2012) at Carbrook was something of an urban legend in the 1990s. Courtesy Scott Wagstaff

That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010.

Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat. No sooner had the bait hit the surface, a shark duly appeared.

The stunned Wagstaff snapped some shots before taking a short video on his phone to post online. The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: the viral YouTube video has amassed more than 2.3 million views to date.

Carbrook Golf Club Shark in the Lake

Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor.

A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls.

Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking.

Compared to the crocodiles and snakes dotting other courses in the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents. Only two risk-management steps were taken: warning signage around the lake, and the rejection of any business from prospective golf ball divers, who retrieve balls from course lakes to sell them on.

“It’s just not worth the few grand a year we get for a contract to put someone’s life at risk,” Wagstaff said.

Unprecedented

Fascination spread far beyond Australian borders, piquing the interest of one shark-loving scientist and researcher based at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany.

Dr. Peter Gausmann published his study on the Carbrook sharks, titled “Who’s the biggest fish in the pond?” in the Marine and Fishery Sciences journal in August 2023. Their extended residence, he argued, sheds new light on just how adaptable bull sharks are.

Even without the staff feeding the sharks, hunger was not a cause for concern in a lake 700 meters long, 380 meters wide and 15 meters deep, teeming with fish, from mullets to tarpons and snappers.

Gausmann calculated that the sharks would need to consume half a ton of fish per year – or 0.44% of their body weight per day – to meet their energy needs. Having been juveniles when they arrived, sightings verified they had grown to a healthy range of between 1.8 and 3 meters by 2013.

Only twice before had bull sharks been recorded surviving for years in isolated bodies of water, according to Gausmann, yet none had ever lasted so long.

One group made it at least four years in Panama’s freshwater Lake Bayano in the 1980s, while another survived a decade of high salinity in South Africa’s Lake St. Lucia after becoming trapped in 2002.

A stay of at least 17 years in low-salinity waters — more than half a bull shark’s lifespan — was unprecedented.

“This out of the ordinary occurrence has shown verifiably for the first time how long bull sharks are able to survive in these low-salinity environments,” Gausmann told CNN.

“The study has shown that bull sharks presumably have no limits to their residential time in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers, and they are presumably – at least theoretically – able to spend their entire lifetime in these habitats.”

Vanished

Sadly for Gausmann and Carbrook, the true extent of their survivability remains unknown.

It’s been eight years since a shark was last spotted in the lake. Their vanishing is a mystery, even to Gausmann.

Sightings dropped in frequency after the 2013 floods, leading to fears that some sharks may have returned to the river or died as a result of the storm. Just two sharks were confirmed dead; one found floating on the surface, another killed by illegal fishing.

Wagstaff, who had never noticed any sign of ill health among the sharks in more than 100 sightings, saw them only fleetingly after the fishing death. Gausmann believes it was unlikely the remaining sharks died in a “natural way” due to sodium loss or by any other “anatomical” failure, given their adaptability, and therefore theorizes that further illegal fishing is the “most likely” explanation for their disappearance.

Whatever the reason, it’s an absence felt keenly by the club.

“You can’t help yourself – you walk along the lake and you’re looking in, waiting to maybe catch a glimpse of a fin breaking the water,” Wagstaff said.

“The members loved the fact that their golf course was their unique place in the world where we had sharks; they just embraced it.

“We’d love to see them again.”

Last year, the course was submerged by the biggest flood ever recorded in the area, Wagstaff said. Though devastating financially, closing the club for two months, it sparked hope that new sharks may have crossed from the river to repopulate the lake.

Only time will tell, but Carbrook is already planning for a future without its mascot. Plans are in place to fill in the lake and build a new course there over the next decade, with all marine life – potential sharks included – subsequently relocated into waters elsewhere.

Whether Wagstaff ever spots another fin in the lake or not, he will remember “Patch” and co. fondly as the guests who helped him overcome his fears. Once afraid of the ocean due to sharks, Wagstaff recently went scuba diving in the reefs of the Sunshine Coast to get up close and personal with some large grey nurse sharks.

“There’s this kind of legend about sharks being aggressive because they’re coming into contact with humans, especially bull sharks because of the places they tend to swim – canals, creeks and rivers,” Wagstaff said.

“But then to experience them in such close proximity and see how beautiful they are and how graceful they are – now I just find them fascinating, especially the bull shark.

“They’re capable, so adaptive, and they are seriously beautiful when you’re a few feet away. It’s an incredible shark.”","['vanished', 'water', 'inadvertently', 'sharks', 'australian', 'club', 'carbrook', 'bull', 'lake', 'course', 'wagstaff', 'shark', 'river', 'golf']","Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks.

82,Hornussen: The dangerous Swiss golf-baseball hybrid you've never heard of,"CNN —

To most people, the words Swiss sport and Emmental might trigger thoughts of Roger Federer eating cheese.

Yet to those familiar with the sprawling countryside and farmlands of the Swiss heartland region where the cheese originated, there’s been a traditional game synonymous with the area for centuries.

Sending projectiles hurtling through the air at 200 miles per hour, all rise – and then duck – for Hornussen.

Risk and reward

Described as a hybrid of baseball and golf, Hornussen sees two teams of 18 take turns hitting and fielding the “Nouss” or “Hornuss,” a puck named after hornets for its buzzing sound as it whistles through the air.”

Armed with a 3-meter (9.84-foot) carbon stick called a “Träf,” hitters take to a raised batting ramp in front of a playing area – the “Ries” – some 300 meters (980 feet) long and 10 meters (32 feet) wide. Their task is to strike the puck from the sloped platform, known as the “Bock,” as far as they can down the field.

Scoring starts if they reach the 100-meter line, with an additional point awarded for every 10 meters past the marker. Crucially though, points are only registered if the Nouss lands, with fielders spread at intervals seeking to block the puck from landing with bats, or “Schindels.”

The sport’s format has drawn comparisons to golf, with some even suggesting it was a forerunner to the sport’s modern incarnation.

“The similarity is that like a ball, you hit a puck, and you hit it far away, but here you want to make some goals, not holes,” said Michael Kummer, member of national championship winning team Hochstetten Hornussen.

“People from other countries call Hornussen the ‘Farmer’s Golf’, so I think there’s some similarities.”

Yet while in golf only an errant shot is likely to present any danger to others, in Hornussen, putting yourself in harm’s way is an essential part of the game. With pucks of pressed plastic whizzing towards you at speeds akin to an F1 car, stopping them is a feat as treacherous as it is tricky. Though players often wear helmets and shielding gear, some take to the field without any such protection.

“It’s really dangerous if you don’t see the Nouss or if one hits the bat and, two meters before the face, the Nouss changes direction,” Kummer explained.

“If it goes in the eyes or around the head it’s really dangerous.”

‘The Lionel Messi of Hornussen’

Originating in the mid-17th century in the Emmental valley and, barring brief forays into neighboring Germany, Hornussen has never left Switzerland, with few teams existing outside the west-central canton of Bern.

The need for vast expanses of open grass to contest games forms part of the reason the sport has been limited to the rural area of Emmental, Kummer explains, adding that ventures into Germany ultimately fell short when teams couldn’t find enough players.

Yet for Kummer, it is this very rootedness in Switzerland that makes Hornussen – alongside yodeling and schwingen, a form of wrestling – a pillar of the nation’s sporting culture.

“With yodelling and schwingen it’s one of the three culture sports of Switzerland and we like it,” he said.

Around 260 teams are active across a multi-league pyramid in Switzerland, with the top teams fighting it out for the Swiss Championship.

And as winners of the last five titles, Kummer’s Hochstetten are very much the Bayern Munich of the Hornussen world.

With Hochstetten boasting a number of tall, strong players, at first glance it would seem that physical attributes are hugely influential in a team’s performance. Yet Kummer insists that size matters only up to a point.

“We have some big guys, but we also have small guys and it’s one of the nice things about this sport,” he said.

“The small guys can also make a good play in the field and they can hit the Nouss as long as the big guys.”

Take Kumer’ teammate Simon Ernie; though relatively diminutive in stature compared to some of his peers, Ernie was the league’s top scorer during his team’s most recent title winning campaign.

“He is the Lionel Messi of Hornussen, and he’s also a small guy,” Kummer said. “He’s one of the smallest on our team.”","['hornussen', 'puck', 'sport', 'swiss', 'golfbaseball', 'meters', 'nouss', 'heard', 'switzerland', 'hybrid', 'kummer', 'youve', 'teams', 'dangerous', 'golf']","CNN —To most people, the words Swiss sport and Emmental might trigger thoughts of Roger Federer eating cheese.

84,Bayard Rustin biopic spotlights organizer of the March on Washington,"CNN —

He stood 6-foot-1, weighed 190 pounds and moved with the grace of an athlete. A sharp dresser who favored linen shirts and stylish ties, Bayard Rustin sported a Clark Gable mustache and adopted a British accent that gave him an even more courtly bearing.

There was no civil rights leader who quite looked or spoke like Rustin. He was the Rev. Martin Luther King’s nonviolent spiritual mentor, the chief organizer of the epic 1963 March on Washington and an openly gay Black man who “never apologized for who he was, what he believed or who he desired” during an era when homosexuality was seen as a perversion deserving imprisonment.

“He looked great on a speaker’s platform,” says Arch Puddington, who worked with Rustin in the early 1970s at a labor organization that encouraged Black workers to be more active in unions.

“He’d get up and speak to some of these Black audiences and he could really set them on fire,” Puddington told CNN. “And he hardly ever spoke from a text. I would write text for him, and he would just completely ignore it.”

The man who organized what was then the largest peacetime protest in American history eventually became known as the movement’s “unsung hero,” largely fading into obscurity by his death in 1987.

But now Rustin is returning to the spotlight. “Rustin,” a biopic that depicts how Rustin navigated a gantlet of personal and political hurdles to pull off the March on Washington, debuts on Netflix today.

The film, made by Barack and Michelle Obama’s production company, comes amid a mini-Rustin renaissance. Recent months have also brought a new musical, “Bayard Rustin: Inside Ashland,” and a new book, “Bayard Rustin: A Legacy of Protest and Politics,” edited by Michael G. Long.

The new film is a good introduction to Rustin, and how social change takes place. Directed by George C. Wolfe, it crackles with energy. The actor Colman Domingo captures much of Rustin’s charisma and shrewd intelligence. The movie also reveals how some of the biggest battles civil rights leaders fought to put on the march were with one another, over turf and ego.

Much of the film’s urgency is a result of its tight focus. It’s structured around Rustin’s frantic campaign to organize the march, showing how he and 200 volunteers summoned 250,000 demonstrators to Washington with only two months for planning. They did so during an era of clattering typewriters, landline telephones and mimeograph machines — long before the internet or social media existed.

“It was the greatest moment in my life,” Rustin said in an oral history of the civil rights movement called “Voices of Freedom.”

It was one of the greatest moments in American history as well. The film, though, offers something more than a history lesson. It offers at least three lessons on leadership and social change.

Lesson 1: Character counts more than charisma

Character, it’s been said, is who you are when no one is watching. Rustin’s film, and his life, illustrates that lesson in several ways.

The civil rights movement was full of charismatic speakers. Yet many of its greatest leaders defined themselves not by what they said on camera, but by the decisions they made in private.

Malcolm X, for example, could fire up a crowd like few others. But his decision to break with Elijah Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam, helped seal his greatness. He knew his decision would likely cost him his life, but he was willing to take that chance because of his integrity.

King’s decision to oppose the Vietnam War was also widely unpopular. He lost the support of an American president, Black leaders turned against him and donations to the civil rights organization he co-founded dried up. But he did so because, like Malcolm, he shared a core commitment to his integrity.

Many pivotal moments in “Rustin,” and in the activist’ life, come down to the same moral calculus.

In a tense, private meeting depicted in the film, A. Philip Randolph (magnificently played by actor Glynn Turman) stands up for Rustin when other civil rights leaders tried to get him booted from the march because of his sexual orientation.

Rustin earned the respect of people like Randolph and King in part because of what he did when the cameras weren’t turned toward him.

He was a pacifist who went to prison during World War II rather than violate his beliefs. He did time on a chain gang and was viciously beaten several times for his activism but refused to retaliate because of his belief in nonviolence.

He also spent time in India studying Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolence, which he later passed on to King — leading some to call him the “American Gandhi.”

Rustin was deeply involved in virtually every major civil rights struggle of the mid-20th century, when many of those movements weren’t popular or covered by the press.

“He [Rustin] established a standard for honesty and fortitude that was unusually high in his era and much needed in ours,” Puddington wrote in one essay about Rustin.

Rustin’s character could also be seen in the way he handled his sexual orientation: no apologies; no double life.

During one scene of the film, he tells King he’s not going to hide who he is from other civil rights leaders.

“On the day I was born Black, I was also born a homosexual,” he says. “They either believe in freedom and justice for all or they do not.”

Lesson 2: Every movement needs a ‘glue’ person

General Omar Bradley, an American commander during World War II, is known to have said: “Amateurs talk strategy and professionals talk logistics.”

Bradley’s quote may be apocryphal, but it reflects a truism in warfare. The best-supplied armies often win. Battlefield victories often result not from clever strategies but from logistics — making sure troops have enough supplies and working equipment.

The same principle applies in sports. In the NBA, for example, there are certain unglamorous players on championship teams known as “glue guys.” They do the dirty work of setting screens, delivering hard fouls, rebounding and playing defense.

Rustin was the “glue guy” leader for the civil rights movement. Every movement needs one.

Rustin was a great organizer because he paid attention to details. He knew how many sandwiches and portable bathrooms the March on Washington participants needed. He knew how to raise money, how to charter buses to Washington and how to negotiate with sound engineers to make sure King’s voice could be heard across the Mall when he delivered his climatic “I Have a Dream” speech.

Watching Rustin organize the march in the film felt more exciting than the film’s depiction of the march itself.

There’s a scene in the movie where Ella Baker, one of the leaders of the civil rights movement who never got her due because of her gender, tells Rustin about the Ying and Yang every movement needs: a person in front and a logistical master behind the scenes. She sees that in Rustin’s partnership with King.

“On your own, you and Martin are fine,” she tells Rustin. “But together, you are fire.”

Lesson 3: Action without hope is impossible

The author Rebecca Solnit once wrote: “Hope calls for action; action is impossible without hope.”

Solnit says some of the biggest enemies of social change are cynicism and pessimism. Opponents of movements often try to convince demonstrators that they have no reason to expect they could win.

But Rustin had an ability to inspire marginalized people to believe they could win. One of the best passages in the film shows him molding a group of young, Black, brown and White civil rights activists into the crack team that would organize the March on Washington.

Rustin’s exuberance reflected the spirit of his time. He lived in another America full of can-do spirit. The country had defeated fascism during World War II; rebuilt Europe, pledged to send a man to the moon and wipe out poverty with President’s Johnson’s Great Society program. That optimism seeps through the movie.

Some of that patriotism may seem naïve now, but it furnished the civil rights movement with tremendous vitality. There are scenes in the film of Rustin mobilizing his young volunteers that conjure memoires of former President Obama’s first campaign, when young people across America bonded together for “hope and change.”

At one point in the film, a young organizer proposes a wild idea, and while others shout the person down, Rustin praises the volunteer.

“Don’t stifle an impulse before it’s born,” he shouts with a huge smile.

Optimism was a core organizing principle for Rustin, says Puddington, who is also a senior scholar emeritus at the Freedom House, a group that defends human rights and promotes democratic change throughout the world.

“Bayard was among those rare individuals who believed that if your cause was just and you had access to the basic tools of democracy, your time would come,” Puddington wrote in an essay about Rustin.

“For gay people today who live in democratic settings, Bayard’s optimism has been validated with each new victory for equality.”

Rustin refused to be defined by his race or sexual orientation

There is one risk that comes with renewed appreciation of Rustin: It’s easy to short-change his complexity. He’s invariably defined primarily through his sexual orientation – something his enemies often did.

But Rustin said his faith as a Quaker was central to his identity.

“My activism did not spring from my being Black,” he once said. “It is rooted fundamentally in my Quaker upbringing.”

This April 1969 file photo shows Rustin in his Park Avenue office in New York City. A Quaker and a pacifist, Rustin served as chief strategist for Martin Luther King's march but was kept mostly in the background because some organizers considered him a liability. A. Camerano/AP

Rustin said those Quaker values were built “on the concept of a single human family,” and that racial injustice was a challenge to that belief.

“It demanded my involvement in the struggle to achieve interracial democracy, “he said, “but it is very likely that I would have been involved had I been a White person with the same philosophy.”

Rustin has been called many labels: a great civil rights activist, a gay pioneer, an “American Gandhi,” and “Mr. March on Washington.” Maybe it’s time we call simply describe him the way the author Cathy Young once did in an essay:

As “a great American and a true hero.”

86,Water at Kealia pond in Hawaii has turned pink amid drought,"CNN —

A pond in Hawaii looks like something right out of a fairy tale. Water at the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge, one of the few coastal salt marshes on the island of Maui, has been bright pink since at least October 30, officials say, after its salt content surged amid an extreme drought.

Water samples sent to the University of Hawaii suggest that halobacteria is behind the pond’s new magenta hue, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

Halobacteria are single-celled organisms that thrive in very salty water, like the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. The bacterium is considered a so-called extremophile because of its ability to live in such an extreme environment – in this case, one where the water salinity is twice that of seawater, Fish and Wildlife noted.

While Kealia literally means “salt encrustation,” the pond’s salinity has skyrocketed well beyond normal because of Maui’s extreme drought. The entire island is in severe or worse drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. The area where the Kealia Pond refuge is located is in what’s considered an extreme drought – the second-worst on the Drought Monitor’s scale.

@Traviskeahi_photo/Instagram

The Waikapu Stream, which brings water from the West Maui Mountains down into the Kealia Pond, also flows through the area of extreme drought. Less freshwater input into the pond has driven the salt concentration up and provided a cozy haven for the brightly hued halobacteria.

Around 90% of Maui County, which includes other islands, is in at least severe drought – one that has grown even worse since a deadly wildfire ripped through Lahaina in August.

Scientists are still studying how the climate crisis will affect Hawaii, but overall there is confidence drought will get worse as global temperature increases – even in tropical areas such as this.","['water', 'pond', 'maui', 'kealia', 'drought', 'extreme', 'hawaii', 'salt', 'pink', 'turned', 'worse', 'amid', 'wildlife']","Water at the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge, one of the few coastal salt marshes on the island of Maui, has been bright pink since at least October 30, officials say, after its salt content surged amid an extreme drought.

87,"China blames Canada for ‘malicious, provocative’ moves after close midair intercepts over South China Sea","Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

China has accused Canada of carrying out “malicious and provocative” actions in the South China Sea, after the Canadian Navy said Chinese fighter jets endangered a helicopter in two close intercepts above international waters.

The comments come after CNN revealed last week that a Chinese warplane fired flares in front of a Canadian military helicopter on October 29, an operation that Canadian military officers said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft.

The incident was the second of two “unsafe” encounters the Canadian chopper had on that day with Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy J-11 fighters, which got as close as 100 feet (30 meters) from the helicopter, Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, told CNN in an interview on the warship.

Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair briefed reporters on the incidents later Friday, saying the Chinese jets’ actions were deemed to be “significantly unsafe” and put “the safety of all personnel involved in unnecessary risk.”

Canada said both incidents took place in international waters within the South China Sea.

China’s Defense Ministry hit back on Saturday, accusing Canada of violating Chinese and international laws, jeopardizing China’s sovereignty and security, and conducting “malicious and provocative act with ulterior motives.”

Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesperson for the Chinese Defense Ministry, said Canada’s HMCS Ottawa frigate flew two helicopter sorties with “unknown intentions” toward China’s airspace around the Xisha Islands – a disputed archipelago claimed by China, Vietnam and Taiwan and also known as the Paracel Islands.

“China’s People’s Liberation Army organized naval and air forces to conduct identification, verification in accordance with the law and issued multiple warnings. However, the Canadian helicopter not only refused to respond, but also took provocative actions such as flying at ultra-low altitudes,” Zhang said in a statement posted on the ministry’s website.

“We urge the Canadian side not to ignore the facts, stop exaggerating and hyping up (the incident), and to strictly restrict the actions of its frontline naval and air forces to prevent accidents at sea and in the air,” he added.

Millen, the Canadian air commander, told CNN he was piloting the helicopter on October 29, when Chinese J-11s intercepted it at close range while it flew straight and level at 3,000 feet above the water back toward the Ottawa, a signal to the Chinese that it had no hostile intent.

He said he had to descend to 200 feet – an area where the helicopter can operate but is “very uncomfortable for fast air fighter jets” – to end the “unsafe” encounter with Chinese jets.

The Chinese fighters flew in circles so close that his helicopter experienced turbulence coming off the jets, which posed a danger to the copter, Millen said.

China claims historic jurisdiction over almost the entirety of the vast South China Sea, which is a resource rich and vital international shipping route. Since 2014 Beijing has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants.

In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling and Western powers routinely conduct naval passages through the sea to uphold the claim that it is an international waterway.

The latest incidents are the second risky midair intercept Canada has accused China of conducting last month.

In mid-October, a Chinese fighter jet came within 5 meters (16 feet) of a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance and surveillance plane over the East China Sea.

That incident was recorded by news crews aboard the Canadian aircraft and witnessed by Maj. Gen. Iain Huddleston, the commander of Canada’s 1st Air Division, who was also on the plane.

Huddleston called the intercept “unprofessional” and “very aggressive” in a report from Radio Canada, which was on the plane.

“The Canadian aircraft was subject to multiple close-proximity maneuvers by a PLAAF aircraft that put the safety of all personnel at risk,” Canada’s Defense Ministry said in a statement.

China’s Foreign Ministry said the Canadian plane illegally entered Chinese airspace and accused the Canadian military of sending “warplanes halfway around the world to stir up trouble and make provocations at China’s doorsteps.”","['malicious', 'midair', 'close', 'helicopter', 'sea', 'intercepts', 'canada', 'chinese', 'international', 'china', 'air', 'south', 'moves', 'jets', 'provocative', 'canadian', 'ministry']","Hong Kong CNN —China has accused Canada of carrying out “malicious and provocative” actions in the South China Sea, after the Canadian Navy said Chinese fighter jets endangered a helicopter in two close intercepts above international waters.

88,Caster Semenya says she went through ‘hell’ due to testosterone limits imposed on female athletes,"CNN —

South Africa’s two-time Olympic champion Caster Semenya told CNN that having to take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete internationally was “hell” and had a negative impact on her health.

In her new book, “The Race To Be Myself,’ Semenya describes the damaging impact the medication had on her body and now says she wants to use her platform to stop other women having to endure the same thing.

“I would say it was hell because each and every day you live under stress,” Semenya told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga, speaking about taking the medication.

The runner has been at the forefront of controversy. She has been supported by athletes of world renown like tennis great Martina Navratilova but British runner Lynsey Sharp tearfully said how “difficult” it was for her and others to compete against Semenya.

Sharp broke down in tears after watching Semenya storm away to victory at the Rio Olympics in 2016.

Semenya is hyperandrogenous – meaning she has naturally high levels of testosterone – and is fighting against new rules introduced in 2019 by track and field’s governing body World Athletics (WA) – and previously known as the IAAF – that regulate levels of the hormone in female athletes.

In July this year, Semenya won an appeal which she had submitted to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to end the testosterone limits.

“You are not happy within; you are never happy. It makes you feel sick, nauseous. You have panic attacks. It starts creating a little bit of blood clots in your system,” Semenya says.

“Your stomach is burning. You eat a lot. You can’t sleep. You sweat a lot each and every day.

“It’s like digging a hole that you can never fill up. You know, it’s like you measure a casket and you get in and then you bury yourself. It was not easy. It was a hard time.”

Caster Semenya was one of the most dominant runners in the world during her prime. Cameron Spencer/Getty Images

In a statement to CNN, World Athletics said it stood by its rules and research.

“World Athletics has over a decade of research, directly from DSD athletes in our own sport, that show high testosterone levels do provide an unfair advantage in the female category,” World Athletics said.

“The research also shows that the frequency of DSD individuals in the elite athlete population is around 140 times higher than you will find in the general female population. This is why our guidelines on testosterone thresholds are necessary, reasonable, and proportionate to protect the integrity of the female category and have been upheld by two Courts.

“If we don’t protect the female category, then women and young girls will not choose sport.”

Inconclusive impact on performance

Semenya won the 800m gold medal at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics Games, but the rules introduced by World Athletics in 2019 meant she would need to take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete internationally over distances between 400m and one mile – something she has declined to do. She was unable to defend her 800m crown in Tokyo in 2021 because of the rule changes.

Variations in people’s reproductive anatomy, chromosome patterns or other traits that may not align with typical binary definitions of female or male are what is defined as differences in sex development (DSD).

It is difficult to estimate how many people have DSD traits – many live their entire lives without ever knowing they have one. Scientists estimate as many as one out of every 50 people is born with DSD traits.

Semenya acknowledged the differences in her body but insisted DSD athletes did not have an unfair advantage in the sport.

“I’m born a woman, but I’m a woman with no uterus. I have no fallopian tubes. I don’t go through menstruation,” Semenya said.

“Yes, I’m different, but it doesn’t make me less of a woman.”

“I am here where I am because of dedication, hard work, discipline and all those things,” she added.

“But then is it considered a threat to a man in sport because, when a woman does great, it becomes a problem. But when a man does good, they’re phenomenal.

“But genetically, it’s something that you can say you cannot control it.”

Semenya has been locked in a battle with World Athletics – notably with its president Sebastian Coe – for almost a decade over the issue of testosterone regulation and lost appeals against the ruling in both 2019 and 2020.

The science on the matter is not entirely conclusive.

Retired endocrinologist Peter Sonksen told CNN in 2021 that “there is good evidence to show muscle bulk increases with increasing dosage of testosterone,” but added that the relationship between blood testosterone level and performance remains “complex and controversial.”

New chapter

Semenya, 32, said she felt ready to write a book about her life, but admitted facing questions about her gender at an early age was difficult.

In the book, she said she was 18 when she first faced scrutiny from World Athletics, then known as the IAAF.

Semenya described the moment as “life-changing.”

“You are 18 years of age and then you get asked if you are not woman enough. Your entire childhood you have been a woman, regardless of the differences that you have in your body,” she said.

“But I think for me, what I had to turn around was the humiliation, you know, the injustice and people treating me with no respect.

“I think the importance for me was knowing who I am, my identity and carrying that to represent my country.”

Semenya said she would continue to “advocate for what is right” for women’s sport, proof that one of the most dominant athletes of her time has not turned her back on the sport she loves quite yet.","['female', 'athletes', 'athletics', 'caster', 'dsd', 'testosterone', 'imposed', 'hell', 'world', 'cnn', 'woman', 'sport', 'body', 'went', 'semenya', 'limits']","In July this year, Semenya won an appeal which she had submitted to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to end the testosterone limits.

89,"Exclusive: Chinese jet fired flares close to submarine-hunting helicopter in South China Sea, Canadian Navy says","Aboard HMCS Ottawa CNN —

A Chinese warplane fired flares in front of a Canadian military helicopter over international waters of the South China Sea last Sunday, an operation that Canadian military officers said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft.

“The risk to a helicopter in that instance is the flares moving into the rotor blades or the engines so this was categorized as both unsafe and non-standard, unprofessional,” said Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, the warship from which the Sikorsky Cyclone helicopter was flying.

The incident was the second of two encounters the Ottawa’s helicopter had with Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy J-11 fighter jets over international waters on October 29, which saw the fighters get as close as 100 feet from the helicopter, Millen told CNN in an interview aboard the warship.

He said that Canada and other nations have seen Chinese aircraft get close to fixed-wing aircraft on numerous occasions, but it was rare to see such action taken against a helicopter.

The first incident was over international waters outside of 34 miles from the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the South China Sea. The second was also over international waters outside of 23 miles from the Paracels. The warship was operating in international waters 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of the Paracels at the time.

The Canadian helicopter was searching for a previously detected submarine when the incidents occurred, officers aboard the Ottawa said.

Millen said he was piloting the Canadian helicopter earlier in the day, when Chinese J-11s intercepted it at close range while it flew straight and level at 3,000 feet above the water back toward the Ottawa, a signal to the Chinese that it had no hostile intent.

In that earlier encounter, Millen said the Chinese fighters flew in circles around his helicopter.

“When the intercepting aircraft was closer and closer, at a certain point it became unsafe,” he said.

His helicopter experienced turbulence coming off the Chinese jets, also posing a danger to the copter, Millen said.

“I certainly am not as comfortable as you can be based on the fragility of the rotor system,” he said.

Millen said he ended that encounter by descending to 200 feet, an area where the helicopter can operate but is “very uncomfortable for fast air fighter jets.”

The Canadian air force major said his military’s air crews train on how to respond to such intercepts as occurred on Sunday and will continue to fly over the international waters of the South China Sea.

Asked about the interception at a regular press briefing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”

“We have reiterated many times our firm position on Canadian warplanes conducting reconnaissance near China’s territorial airspace,” he told reporters. “We hope Canada will refrain from its inappropriate behavior to avoid the situation from becoming more complicated.”

CNN has also reached to China’s Defense Ministry for comment.

China claims historic jurisdiction over almost the entirety of the vast South China Sea, and since 2014 has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants. The Paracels, called the Xisha Islands by China, are in the northern part of the South China Sea, east of Da Nang, Vietnam, and south of China’s Hainan Island.

The 1.3-million-square-mile waterway is vital to international trade, with an estimated third of global shipping worth trillions of dollars passing through each year. It’s also home to vast fertile fishing grounds upon which many lives and livelihoods depend.

In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling.

Freedom of navigation



Major western powers frequently conduct passage across the sea in order to assert that the region is international waters, sparking Beijing’s ire.

The Ottawa had been patrolling the waterway since last Monday, at times operating with United States, Australian, Japanese and New Zealand naval vessels and aircraft in a multinational exercise dubbed Noble Caribou. However, it was operating alone when the encounters with the Chinese jets.

The Ottawa and the US Navy destroyer USS Rafael Peralta overnight Wednesday into Thursday local time continued their deployment into the Taiwan Strait, another international waterway and vital shipping channel that has seen tense

encounters between PLA and allied vessels.

Last June, the US Navy reported a close encounter between the destroyer USS Chung-Hoon and a Chinese warship during a Taiwan Strait transit, in which the US warship slowed down to avoid colliding with the Chinese navy vessel that cut in front of it. The Canadian frigate HMCS Montreal was accompanying the US ship at the time, and a news crew aboard it recorded the incident.

Then Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu blamed the US for ratcheting up tensions in the region when questioned by reporters at a defense conference in Singapore.

“They are not here for innocent passage, they are here for provocation,” Li said of US warships.

Li said if the US and other foreign powers did not want confrontation, they should not send their military assets near China.

“Mind your own business,” Li said, adding, “Why did all these incidents happen in areas near China, not in areas near other countries?”

This week’s passage of the allied warships through the strait was uneventful, however, with no contact reported.

Sunday’s incidents come after other reports of unsafe intercepts of allied aircraft in the recent days.

On Tuesday, a PLA fighter jet came within 10 feet of a US Air Force B-52 bomber flying over the South China Sea, the US military said.

And earlier in October, a Chinese fighter jet came within five meters (16 feet) of a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance and surveillance plane over the East China Sea.

That incident was recorded by news crews aboard the Canadian aircraft and witnessed by Maj. Gen. Iain Huddleston, the commander of Canada’s 1st Air Division, who was also on the plane.

Huddleston called the intercept “unprofessional” and “very aggressive” in a report from Radio Canada, which was on the plane.

“The Canadian aircraft was subject to multiple close-proximity manoeuvres by a PLAAF aircraft that put the safety of all personnel at risk,” Canada’s Defense Ministry said in a statement.

China’s Foreign Ministry said the Canadian plane illegally entered Chinese airspace and accused the Canadian military of sending “warplanes halfway around the world to stir up trouble and make provocations at China’s doorsteps.”

In February, in an incident witnessed by a CNN crew, a Chinese fighter jet came within 500 feet of a US Navy reconnaissance plane flying at 21,500 feet about 30 miles from the Paracels.

Earlier this month, the Pentagon’s top official in charge of security in the Indo-Pacific, Ely Ratner, said that the US has seen more instances of “coercive and risky” behavior from Chinese pilots against US aircraft in the last two years over the East and South China Seas than in the entire decade before that.

“Since the fall of 2021, we have seen more than 180 such incidents,” Ratner said. “It’s a centralized and concerted campaign to perform these risky behaviors in order to coerce a change in lawful US operational activity.”","['waters', 'helicopter', 'close', 'sea', 'flares', 'submarinehunting', 'chinese', 'international', 'aircraft', 'fired', 'china', 'south', 'navy', 'jet', 'canadian', 'exclusive']","The first incident was over international waters outside of 34 miles from the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the South China Sea.

93,Student loan forgiveness: Biden to cancel another $5 billion of debt,"Washington CNN —

The Department of Education said Wednesday that it has approved the cancellation of nearly $5 billion more in federal student loan debt, bringing the total amount of student debt relief provided under the Biden administration to $132 billion for more than 3.6 million borrowers.

Though the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden’s signature student loan forgiveness program, which promised up to $20,000 in debt relief for low- and middle-income borrowers, the administration has continued to find other ways to provide debt relief.

“We are continuing to pursue an alternative path to deliver student debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible,” Biden said in a statement Wednesday.

The cancellations have come through existing federal student loan forgiveness programs, which are limited to specific categories of borrowers, such as public-sector workers, people defrauded by for-profit colleges and borrowers who have paid for at least 20 years.

Those borrowers who are eligible for relief under Wednesday’s announcement qualify in one of two ways: either under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which wipes away remaining student loan debt after qualifying public-sector workers make 10 years’ worth of monthly payments; or because they have made at least 20 years of qualifying payments in an income-driven repayment program but didn’t previously get credit for all of their student loan payments.

Most of these borrowers were notified in November that their outstanding federal student loan debt would be canceled and they can expect to see the changes made to their accounts in the coming weeks.

The Biden administration has been granting student loan forgiveness through these existing programs on a rolling basis since coming into office. To date, it has granted more student loan forgiveness than any other administration – in part due to efforts to temporarily expand some debt relief programs and to correct past administrative errors made to borrowers’ student loan accounts.

“The latest discharges are a result of this administration’s relentless efforts to fix our country’s broken student loan system and get hard-earned debt relief into the hands of eligible borrowers,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said on a call with reporters.

Recounting past payments and fixing errors

Many borrowers are seeing debt relief thanks to a one-time recount of their past payments, an effort undertaken by the Biden administration to fix what officials have called “past administrative failures.”

Borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans, which have been available in some form since 1993, are generally eligible for debt discharges after making qualifying payments for at least 20 years. The plans lower monthly payments by tying them to a borrower’s income and family size.

But the Department of Education has historically had trouble tracking borrowers’ payments.

Last year, the US Government Accountability Office recommended that the department do more to ensure that borrowers receive the forgiveness they are entitled to, after it found that there were thousands of loans still in repayment that could already be eligible for forgiveness.

The one-time account adjustment effort was first announced by the Biden administration in April 2022 and the cancellations did not begin until this year. The department is expected to announce additional batches of borrowers eligible for student debt relief every other month through the spring of next year.

Some Republican lawmakers and conservative groups have argued that the administration does not have the power to recount payments. The Department of Education is facing at least one lawsuit over the account adjustments, filed by the New Civil Liberties Alliance on behalf of the conservative groups Cato Institute and the Mackinac Center for Public Policy.

Payments resumed in October

Borrowers were required to restart making their federal student loan payments in October for the first time in three-plus years after the pandemic-related pause, which essentially froze borrowers’ accounts, came to an end.

In addition to canceling some student loan debt, the Biden administration has also made efforts to lower borrowers’ monthly bills as payments resume.

A new repayment plan launched this summer, called SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education), offers the most generous terms and will likely offer the smallest monthly payment for lower-income borrowers.

The Department of Education is also providing a 12-month on-ramp period through September 2024. During this temporary reprieve, borrowers struggling to make their monthly payments are shielded from some of the worst consequences of making a payment, including negative credit reporting. But some Democratic lawmakers have recently raised concerns that borrowers could see implementation errors during the on-ramp period.

The Biden administration is making another attempt to create a one-time student loan forgiveness program. This time, the administration is relying on a different law than it did for the program struck down by the Supreme Court and is conducting a formal rulemaking process, known as “negotiated rulemaking.” The process takes months and a proposed rule isn’t expected to be released until next year. It could then face legal challenges.","['cancel', 'debt', 'forgiveness', 'borrowers', 'loan', 'relief', 'student', 'biden', 'administration', 'payments', 'education', 'billion']","Washington CNN —The Department of Education said Wednesday that it has approved the cancellation of nearly $5 billion more in federal student loan debt, bringing the total amount of student debt relief provided under the Biden administration to $132 billion for more than 3.6 million borrowers.

94,"Ryan O’Neal, star of ‘Love Story’ and ‘Peyton Place,’ dead","CNN —

Oscar-nominated actor Ryan O’Neal, star of several landmark films including “Love Story” and “Paper Moon,” has died, according to his son, Patrick, who posted the news to social media. He was reportedly 82.

“My dad passed away peacefully today, with his loving team by his side supporting him and loving him as he would us,” Patrick O’Neal wrote on Friday.

He added: “My father Ryan O’Neal has always been my hero. I looked up to him and he was always bigger than life.”

CNN has reached out to a representative for Ryan O’Neal.

Ryan O’Neal’s breakout role came in 1964 on the nighttime soap opera “Peyton Place.”

A Hollywood “Love Story”

After starring in several TV shows throughout the 1960s, O’Neal made an indelible mark on the movies in the 1970 adaptation of the Erich Segal novel “Love Story,” in which he starred opposite Ali MacGraw. The tearjerker film told the story of a wealthy Ivy Leaguer (Ryan O’Neal) who marries an outspoken and irreverent girl (MacGraw), only to watch her die of a terminal illness. Among other things, it popularized the line, “Love means never having to say you’re sorry.”

The film was a huge hit, providing a major boost to Paramount Pictures (which was being run by MacGraw’s then-husband, Robert Evans), and while it established Ryan O’Neal as a classic leading man – and earned him an Oscar nomination in the process – he also found success in comedy, playing opposite Barbra Streisand in “What’s Up, Doc?” and “The Main Event.”

On X (formerly Twitter), Streisand said she was “sad” to hear the news of the actor’s death.

“He was funny and charming, and he will be remembered,” she wrote.

Ryan O’Neal later starred in a “Love Story” sequel called “Oliver’s Story,” which flopped at the box office.

The actor’s eclectic resume included starring with his daughter, Tatum O’Neal, in “Paper Moon,” for which she won an Academy Award for best supporting actress; and the Stanley Kubrick-directed period piece “Barry Lyndon.”

Off screen, O’Neal had a long relationship with actress and pin-up model Farrah Fawcett, which provided endless fodder for the tabloids. The relationship followed earlier marriages to actresses Joanna Moore and Leigh Taylor-Young.

Born in Los Angeles, O’Neal trained to become a professional boxer before he began to pursue acting, appearing in several TV westerns, and eventually landing his regular role on “Peyton Place.”

O’Neal’s more recent credits included recurring roles on the TV shows “Bones” and “Bull,” along with appearances on “Desperate Housewives” and the reboot “90210.”

Strained relationship

Ryan O’Neal and his daughter Tatum O’Neal’s off-screen relationship was strained for many years.

She had struggled with addiction, and in 2011, the father and daughter starred in the reality series “Ryan and Tatum: The O’Neals” on OWN.

A clip of that show was featured that year during a Tatum O’Neal appearance on CNN.

“How would I feel if my father were to, say, get sick or die even? Would I be OK? And I realized that I wouldn’t be OK,” she said in the clip. “So I knew I needed to make an effort, because what is your life without your family? What’s your life without a father?”

In 2020, Tatum O’Neal’s son shared on social media that the family had reconciled.

The actor had four children. In addition to Tatum O’Neal, he had a son, Griffin O’Neal, with Moore. He also had a son, Redmond James O’Neal, with Fawcett. Patrick O’Neal, a sportscaster, was from his marriage with Taylor-Young.

His brother, actor Kevin O’Neal, died earlier this year.

95,"The US economy added 199,000 jobs in November","Minneapolis CNN —

The US economy notched another solid month of job growth, with an added lift from actors and autoworkers coming off the picket lines.

Employers added 199,000 jobs in November, and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.7% from 3.9% the month before, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday.

“The economy’s still humming along,” Jane Oates, a former Department of Labor official who now is CEO of employment education nonprofit WorkingNation, told CNN. “For the past two weeks, all we’ve heard is doom and gloom about how this is going to be a terrible day. And it was a much better day than was predicted.”

Economists were expecting net job gains of 180,000 for the month and for the unemployment rate to hold steady, according to Refinitiv.

The labor force participation rate ticked up 0.1 percentage points to 62.8%, returning to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic. The participation rate increase is a “positive underlying context to the unemployment rate decline,” wrote Daniel Zhao, Glassdoor’s lead economist, in commentary issued Friday.

One-time boosts

The largest employment gains last month came in health care and government, which added an estimated 93,200 and 49,000 jobs, respectively. Manufacturing saw a boost, too, largely because of the return of striking autoworkers, which lifted motor vehicles and parts employment by 30,000 jobs.

Additionally, the resolution of the Screen Actors Guild strike against Hollywood studios resulted in 17,200 jobs added in the motion picture and sound recording industries.

In total, the BLS was anticipating a net gain of 35,000 workers returning after strikes: The agency estimated that 61,000 workers were absent from the labor market due to labor disputes, versus 96,000 the month before.

Taking into account those one-time gains, the underlying rate of job growth is likely around 160,000 jobs per month, which aligns with the 2019 average, wrote Julia Pollak, senior economist with ZipRecruiter.

November’s jobs number is in line with the strong monthly gains hit in the decade before the pandemic, when 183,000 jobs per month were added. The current rate of job growth also is well above the “neutral rate,” or what’s needed to keep up with population growth.

“It is critical to put this data in the proper context,” Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist of RSM US, wrote in a note on Friday. “Given long-term demographic changes and structural transformation of the US economy to keep employment stable, only 75,000 jobs per month need to be created, in contrast with the roughly 200,000 that was the case just over a decade ago.”

Retail drop-off

The biggest declines occurred in the retail trade and temporary help services sectors, which lost 38,400 jobs and 13,600 jobs, respectively.

“The [reason for the] reduction of jobs in retail is very similar to the reduction of jobs in other places, except retail hasn’t been able to absorb — and that’s technology,” Oates said.

As e-commerce and in-store pick-ups become more engrained in how people shop, that leads to fewer people needed at the brick-and-mortar level.

What this means for the Fed

November’s job growth was stronger than October’s unrevised tally of 150,000 jobs added. September’s job gains were revised down to 262,000 from 297,000, according to the BLS.

The continued strength in the labor market has helped fuel consumer spending and economic growth, but Federal Reserve officials believe slower demand (and slower wage growth) will help bring down inflation.

Friday’s jobs report showed that average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in November from the month before, showing a more accelerated pace of growth than the 0.2% uptick seen in October and the 0.3% expected by economists.

On an annual basis, however, wage gains eased to 4% from the 4.1% rate seen a month before.

Through November, the economy has added an average of 232,000 jobs per month — far more moderate growth than 2022 and 2021, when an estimated 399,000 and 606,000 jobs were added every month, respectively.

Friday’s strong jobs report likely keeps the Fed’s options open, although cooling inflation should mean that another pause is in store when the central bank meets next week, wrote Lydia Boussour, EY senior economist.

“Labor market endurance will lead Fed officials to retain some optionality for future rate hikes, if needed,” she wrote. “We expect policymakers will resist talking about rate cuts until early 2024.”","['jobs', 'growth', 'employment', 'labor', 'rate', 'job', 'gains', 'added', '199000', 'month', 'economy', 'wrote']","One-time boostsThe largest employment gains last month came in health care and government, which added an estimated 93,200 and 49,000 jobs, respectively.

CNN —

In a remarkable, six-month turn of events, Hunter Biden, the president’s son, has gone from the cusp of a no-jail-time plea deal to looming trials in Delaware on gun charges and in California on tax charges.

The tax charges filed Thursday build on an uncomfortable narrative about the president’s son – that he was a drug addict who spent large amounts of money on a lavish lifestyle and that he did not pay all of his taxes on time. That he traded on his father’s name was already clear.

While he was able to use his last name to make money, his lawyers now argue he is facing trials that any other American would not. Hunter Biden’s legal battle now seems likely to crescendo with a political campaign in which President Joe Biden is already struggling to convince Americans he should be reelected.

Here’s an overview of the legal jeopardy faced by Hunter Biden and what it could mean for his father:

How many cases is Hunter Biden facing?

Two.

Most recent are the tax charges. These include nine counts – three felonies and six misdemeanors – of alleged tax crimes for the tax years 2016 to 2019.

They were filed Thursday in federal court in Southern California by special counsel David Weiss with a scathing indictment handed down by a federal grand jury. Biden is accused of engaging in a scheme to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in taxes on income and instead funding a lavish lifestyle of drugs and escorts. Read the full report from Evan Perez, Paula Reid, Marshall Cohen, Hannah Rabinowitz and Holmes Lybrand, the CNN team that has been covering this story.

Then there are the three gun-related charges. These were filed in September in Delaware. Biden is accused of making false statements on a federal firearms form and obtaining a handgun and possessing it for 11 days in 2018 at a time when he was addicted to drugs.

What did we learn in the new charges?

Weiss argues that Biden continued to evade taxes into 2020, and in the indictment, he includes a chart of nearly $5 million in spending between 2016 and 2019 – including $683,212 in payments to “various women” and $188,960 on “adult entertainment.”

The 56-page indictment is detailed and complicated and documents millions in income and expenses, some of which Biden is accused of siphoning away from his companies.

A useful summarizing quote from the indictment is this: “Between 2016 and October 15, 2020, the Defendant spent this money on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes.”

What are the max penalties he is facing?

If convicted of all charges in the tax case, Hunter Biden could face up to 17 years in prison.

If convicted of all charges in the gun case, Biden could face up to 25 years in prison, but as CNN reported back in September when the charges were filed, “defendants very rarely get the maximum penalty, especially in cases like these, involving non-violent crimes and an alleged first-time offender.”

What happened to the plea deal?

It fell apart in court.

Back in June, Hunter Biden agreed to a plea deal in which he would have avoided all jail time; admitted guilt to two tax misdemeanors, for which his lawyers argued he already paid back taxes; and agreed to a diversion program on the gun charge.

But a federal judge in Delaware refused in July to accept the deal, in part because it was unclear if the deal would resolve the tax case.

There was also criticism of the deal from Republicans, who said Biden was getting special treatment. Plus, two IRS whistleblowers came forward to argue there had been political pressure to reach a plea deal. Other witnesses in congressional hearings have disputed the claims of the whistleblowers.

Will these new charges satisfy Republican critics?

They will not. The charges make it difficult to argue that Hunter Biden is getting special treatment or that the justice system is targeted only at Republicans, which are both claims Republicans have tried to make.

But Republicans in the House are pushing the idea that President Biden was enriched by his son’s overseas income, including from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma and a Chinese private equity fund. There is no evidence to support that claim.

In a statement after the tax evasion indictment, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who is spearheading House investigations into the president, called on Weiss to further expand his investigation.

“Unless U.S. Attorney Weiss investigates everyone involved in the Bidens’ fraud schemes and influence peddling, it will be clear President Biden’s DOJ is protecting Hunter Biden and the big guy,” Comer wrote, referencing the president as “the big guy.”

Is President Biden implicated in the new charges?

No. While Republicans on Capitol Hill have worked hard to try to tie the president to his son’s foreign income, Weiss, who has been investigating Hunter Biden for five years, does not mention Joe Biden in the indictment against his son.

However, Hunter Biden’s income fell when his father’s position changed. It’s long been known that Hunter Biden was paid to sit on the board of Burisma. His annual salary from the Ukrainian company was around $1 million per year, according to the indictment, until March 2017, when it was cut in half to around $500,000 per year. His father left the vice presidency in January 2017.

How will these charges against his son affect Republicans’ impeachment effort against President Biden?

They are related. Republicans in the House have been working toward an official impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden, but it is based on largely disproven conspiracy theories that feature Burisma and Hunter Biden.

Republicans like House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan have argued, although there is no evidence to support it, that Hunter Biden’s position on Burisma’s board was tied to Joe Biden’s effort to have a prosecutor in Ukraine fired in 2014.

However, as CNN has reported, Jordan’s allegation does not make sense, since the US wanted the prosecutor fired for being soft on corruption and his removal was likely to increase scrutiny of Burisma and Hunter Biden.

Republicans are also considering impeaching Joe Biden for obstruction for lying about his own ties to his son’s business career, although no such ties have ever been shown.

The new indictment, written by the special counsel Weiss, who first started investigating Hunter Biden while Donald Trump was in office, will likely not help that claim since it does not mention the current president.

What does Hunter Biden say?

In a statement after the tax indictment, Hunter Biden’s attorney Abbe Lowell said these charges would never have been brought if his client’s last name was not Biden. He added:

“First, U.S. Attorney Weiss bowed to Republican pressure to file unprecedented and unconstitutional gun charges to renege on a non-prosecution resolution. Now, after five years of investigating with no new evidence – and two years after Hunter paid his taxes in full – the U.S. Attorney has piled on nine new charges when he had agreed just months ago to resolve this matter with a pair of misdemeanors.”

In a podcast interview with the musician Moby (they apparently met in their addiction-recovery journey) recorded before the tax indictment, Hunter Biden said House Republicans, with their impeachment inquiry and investigations, are trying to “kill” him in an effort to damage his father.

“They are trying to, in their most illegitimate way, but rational way, they’re trying to destroy a presidency,” Hunter Biden said in the podcast released Friday. “And so, it’s not about me, and [in] their most base way, what they’re trying to do is they’re trying to kill me, knowing that it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle and so therefore destroying a presidency in that way.”","['weiss', 'problems', 'hunter', 'explained', 'bidens', 'tax', 'deal', 'universe', 'biden', 'briefly', 'indictment', 'republicans', 'president', 'charges', 'legal']","Hunter Biden’s legal battle now seems likely to crescendo with a political campaign in which President Joe Biden is already struggling to convince Americans he should be reelected.

97,"Eastern US weather: A disruptive storm will unload heavy rain, severe thunderstorms, snow and wind this weekend","CNN —

A disruptive storm will unload heavy rain, severe thunderstorms, strong winds and even snow on the eastern half of the US this weekend.

This wide-reaching storm could disrupt travel both on the ground and in the air across more than a dozen states and knock out power with its strong wind, especially in the Northeast.

The weekend storm began to take shape on Friday when an area of low pressure developed in the southern Plains. Energy left over from a deadly atmospheric river in the Northwest earlier this week will arrive in the central US and boost the strength of this storm.

Any impactful weather from the storm will hold off until late Friday when it gets better organized and tracks out of the southern Plains and into the Midwest.

From there, the storm’s impact will grow substantially, with heavy rain, thunderstorms and gusty winds reaching the entire East throughout the weekend.

Saturday: Severe storms fire up

As the storm strengthens and expands its reach on Saturday, adverse weather will stretch more than 1,200 miles from the Gulf Coast to the Canadian border.

Thunderstorms will rumble to life Friday evening with a small window in which isolated severe thunderstorms could move across parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas Friday night, ahead of Saturday’s threat to the south.

The main thunderstorm event will kick off across portions of the South by late Saturday morning as a cold front associated with the storm cuts east across the region.

Severe thunderstorms are possible across the southern and eastern US on Saturday. CNN Weather

Some of these thunderstorms could become severe and deliver damaging wind gusts, hail and even a tornado. A slight risk, or Level 2 of 5, for severe thunderstorms is forecast from eastern Texas through western Tennessee and northern Alabama, especially by Saturday afternoon.

As chances for damaging thunderstorms increase Saturday afternoon and evening, the storm will also spread rain across a wide portion of the country from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest. Rain will begin in the earliest hours of Saturday across portions of the Midwest and Mississippi Valley and spread east throughout the day.

Rain will become steady as the day progresses and could become heavy at times, especially from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio Valley. Fortunately, the storm is likely to move along at a brisk pace that will keep rainfall totals from skyrocketing, but any drenching rainfall could cause flooding issues.

Gusty winds will also accompany any rainfall, even outside of thunderstorms.

A thin stripe of accumulating snow is possible on Saturday from Wisconsin to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, but this will be mostly a rain event for much of the Midwest.

Sunday: Strong wind event takes shape

The storm will reach its maximum strength by the afternoon as it expands and engulfs much of the East. Wind gusts from the storm will be quite a bit stronger on Sunday compared to Saturday and could knock out power and disrupt travel.

Widespread gusts of 40 to 50 mph will buffet the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Gusts will crank even higher and reach up to 60 mph at times Sunday night in New England and coastal portions of New York and New Jersey.

Strong wind gusts will impact the Northeast, especially on Sunday evening. CNN Weather

Winds this strong, especially when coupled with drenching rain, could bring down a few trees and cause power outages. Strong winds and rain may also disrupt air travel across the busy corridor and lead to slowdowns for drivers.

Any unsecured outdoor holiday decorations may be blown away by the strongest winds.

Rain will be the primary precipitation type from Florida to New England, with widespread amounts of 1 to 2 inches likely. Higher totals are possible for areas drenched by multiple rounds of downpours.

Some thunderstorms will be embedded within the rainy area, even in the North. A few thunderstorms may become severe on Sunday, with an area from the Florida Panhandle to Virginia the most likely to endure a handful of damaging storms. Damaging wind gusts will be the main threat with these storms, but an isolated tornado is also possible.

Rain is likely to change to wet snow across higher elevations in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and much of upstate New York on Sunday night as cold air pushes into the East on the backside of the storm.

Portions of New England could change over to a wintry mix of rain, snow and freezing rain late Sunday night through Monday.

Exact changeover times and snow amounts will depend on how quickly cold air can rush into the region.

Monday: Cold envelops the East

The storm will start to push off the East Coast on Monday, but rain and snow will continue across much of New England and parts of upstate New York for much of the day. Wet snow could accumulate through Monday evening in the high elevations of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.

Rainy, windy weather will come to an end in New York City Monday afternoon while gusty winds slowly subside elsewhere in the Northeast, except for in New England. Strong winds will slam the New England coast into Monday night.

It’ll be much chillier on Monday across the eastern half of the country in the wake of the storm. The difference in temperature between Monday and the weekend’s above average December temperatures will be most stark from the Southeast to Northeast.","['storm', 'snow', 'thunderstorms', 'unload', 'strong', 'severe', 'winds', 'weekend', 'weather', 'rain', 'england', 'gusts', 'heavy', 'wind']","CNN —A disruptive storm will unload heavy rain, severe thunderstorms, strong winds and even snow on the eastern half of the US this weekend.

98,The self-checkout reversal is growing,"New York CNN —

Dollar General is joining the growing list of retail chains reversing course on self-checkout technology.

“We had started to rely too much this year on self-checkout in our stores,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said Thursday on an earnings call. “We should be using self-checkout as a secondary checkout vehicle, not a primary.”

Dollar General had aggressively expanded self-checkout stations, adding them to more than half of its approximately 19,000 stores. The company also piloted stores with only self-checkout options and no cashier lanes. Like other retailers, Dollar General bet self-checkout would reduce its labor costs and speed up checkout for customers.

But Dollar General, which has skeleton staffing levels in stores, has recently been re-assigning workers to the front of its stores to ring customers up.

The company revised its self-checkout strategy to improve sales and cut down on merchandise losses, known as “shrink.” Shrink includes shoplifting, employee theft, damaged products, administrative errors, online fraud and other factors.

“It helps on the sales line because we’ve got somebody to meet, greet and ring up the customer,” Vasos said. “It also helps on the shrink line because (we’ve) got somebody at the front end of the store that is always there to monitor” the area.

Shrink has been a growing problem for retailers, who have blamed shoplifting for the increase in losses and called for tougher criminal penalties.

But retailers’ self-checkout strategies have also contributed to their shrink woes. Retailers lose more possible sales with self-checkout than full-service cashiers, both from intentional shoplifting and honest errors by customers.

One study of retailers in the United States, Britain and other European countries found that companies with self-checkout lanes and apps had a loss rate of about 4%, more than double the industry average.

Dollar General is the latest company to backtrack on self checkout.

Booths, a British supermarket chain, said it’s removing self-checkout stations in all but two of its 28 stores. Walmart removed self-checkout machines at some stores in New Mexico earlier this year. ShopRite pulled them at a Delaware store after customer complaints.

Five Below, the discount toy retailer, said that shrink at stores with more self-checkout lanes was higher, and it will increase the number of staffed cash registers in new locations.

Other retailers are making tweaks to self-checkout policies.

At a handful of stores, Target has restricted self-checkout to customers buying 10 items or fewer. Customers buying more than 10 items are required to use full-service lanes with cashiers.

Costco said it’s adding more staff in self-checkout areas after it found that non-members were sneaking in to use membership cards that didn’t belong to them at self-checkout.","['retailers', 'selfcheckout', 'stores', 'shrink', 'growing', 'dollar', 'customers', 'reversal', 'sales', 'lanes', 'shoplifting', 'general']","New York CNN —Dollar General is joining the growing list of retail chains reversing course on self-checkout technology.

99,Takeaways from Election Day 2023 in America,"CNN —

For all the sound and fury around Tuesday’s elections, there was one clear signal: Abortion rights are politically popular, no matter where or when they are on the ballot.

And that, no matter how you slice it, is good news for Democrats as the parties plot their strategies ahead of the 2024 elections.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin – the Virginia Republican who believed he could crack one of the most intractable issues in American politics with the promise of “reasonable” abortion restrictions – will not lead a GOP-controlled legislature in the Commonwealth, which denied the party control of the state Senate and put a swift end to both his plan for a 15-week abortion ban and rumors he might pursue a 2024 presidential bid.

Meanwhile, voters in Ohio decisively said they wanted a constitutionally protected right to abortion with the passage of a ballot measure – only a few months after they rejected another measure that would have made it harder for them to shield abortion rights.

And in Kentucky, the Democratic governor defeated his Republican challenger, a state attorney general with close ties to former President Donald Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, after a campaign in which abortion became a flashpoint.

Retaining control of the Virginia state Senate completed a hat trick of invigorating results for Democrats, who have endured a dispiriting week with multiple polls, including a new one from CNN, that show President Joe Biden could face an uphill fight against Trump in case of a 2020 rematch in 2024.

Here are the key election night takeaways on a strong night for Democrats:

As Ohio goes, so goes the nation?

Tuesday night’s election results probably won’t change the equation for Biden in 2024, given Ohio’s recent presidential electoral history. But how about Sen. Sherrod Brown? The Ohio Democrat faces a difficult reelection run next year, but outcomes from the Buckeye State may give him a boost.

Already a proven political winner for Democrats, abortion rights further solidified their place as a driving force in next year’s elections when voters in Ohio, an increasingly conservative state that voted twice for Trump, passed a ballot measure on Tuesday enshrining them in the state constitution.

Red, blue and purple states alike have green-lit similar proposals, solidifying a trend that defies partisan expectations and could have an outsized influence on next year’s federal elections.

In the end, though, Ohio Republicans might have gotten off easy. Their referendum took place now, during an off-year with no voting for statewide office or president. Other state Republican parties might not be so lucky.

In Arizona, activists are gathering signatures for a 2024 ballot initiative that will ask voters a similar question to Ohio’s this year – a development that already has Republicans there fretting.

“Tonight’s results in Ohio should scare every Republican in a state where an abortion question is on the ballot in 2024,” Arizona Republican strategist Barrett Marson told CNN. “Abortion initiatives are both driving turnout among Democrats and forcing Republicans to talk about an issue of which they are on the wrong side of the electorate.”

A handful of potential swing states, including Pennsylvania, Iowa, Florida and Colorado, could have abortion rights measures on their ballots alongside the presidential candidates next year.

Glenn Youngkin and Virginia hit a wall

The Youngkin 2024 bandwagon ran off the road on Tuesday, when Virginia voters denied the governor and his party the legislative majorities they craved.

That means no 15-week abortion ban, which Youngkin backed as a “reasonable” solution that, in his telling, was going to douse the rage of Americans who disagreed with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year.

It also likely puts to bed rumors that Youngkin, who has always insisted he had no ambitions to move north of Virginia, will attempt a late entry into the 2024 GOP presidential primary. The logic there turned on the governor’s ability to craft a coalition that included the far-right, the center-right and the pure centrist swing voter – or something akin to what won him the governor’s mansion in 2021.

But with CNN projecting Virginia Democrats will retain control of the state Senate and flip the House of Delegates, Youngkin’s power appears to have met its limit.

Democrat Andy Beshear won reelection in Kentucky. But who lost?

Andy Beshear won a second term on Tuesday in a state that Trump carried by more than 25 points in 2020.

Now the real fight begins.

Endorsed by Trump but often described as McConnell’s protégé, Daniel Cameron’s defeat will stir a lot of finger-pointing within the Republican Party. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was directing his at the former president shortly after the polls closed, calling the result “another loss for Trump.”

“The losing will only end for Republicans if we rid ourselves of Donald Trump,” Christie tweeted in a preview of his message to primary voters Wednesday night during the third GOP presidential debate. “Trump – loser in ‘18, ‘20, ‘21, ‘22 and now ‘23.”

Trump will likely take a different view of the matter, but the reality might be that neither high-ranking Republican Party leader had a direct effect on the Kentucky electorate, which has routinely given Beshear high marks for his work and appears to have been concerned about Cameron’s stance on abortion.

Last year, Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure that would have denied constitutional protections for abortion. During the campaign, Beshear hammered Cameron, the state attorney general, over his support for the the strict law currently in place, which does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.

Democrats’ big night – despite Biden’s weak polling

The president’s party notched a series of high-stakes victories on Tuesday night, with Democratic candidates and Democratic issues winning big ticket votes.

Still, it’s been a bummer of a week for Biden, who found himself on the short end of multiple 2024 polls. Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley all came in ahead, if narrowly, in hypothetical matchups against the president, per a new CNN poll of registered voters.

The picture was similarly grim in battleground state surveys, conducted by The New York Times and Siena College and released over the weekend.

But for one night, at least, the Biden campaign believed it had reason to crow.

After Beshear clinched Kentucky and Ohio enshrined abortion rights in its state constitution, Biden’s campaign manager sent out a statement (to reporters) and an email (to supporters) touting the results.

“In hundreds of races since Donald Trump’s conservative Supreme Court appointments overturned Roe v. Wade, we’ve seen Americans overwhelmingly side with President Biden and Democrats’ vision for this country,” Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez wrote, after railing against “the dangerous MAGA extremism that has come to define today’s Republican Party at every level.”

Direct votes on hot button issues rarely correlate with candidate performance, even when those candidates are on the right side of public opinion. But another round of elections with abortion rights winning across party lines is plainly good news for a president who, after these last few weeks, can use it.

History-making wins in Rhode Island and Philadelphia

Government will look a little more like the governed after Tuesday night’s results are all in.

To start, Democrat Gabe Amo is the projected winner of Rhode Island’s special congressional election. He will be the first Black person to represent the state in Congress.

“As the first Black man to represent Rhode Island in Congress and a proven, dedicated leader, Gabe will be an important voice in the Democratic Caucus and the House of Representatives,” the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said in a statement.

And in Philadelphia, former city councilmember Cherelle Parker will become the first woman to lead the City of Brotherly Love.

She’ll be the city’s fourth Black mayor – and the 100th in its long history.","['party', 'voters', 'takeaways', 'america', 'trump', '2023', 'republican', 'virginia', 'abortion', '2024', 'president', 'ohio', 'state', 'election', 'day']","Here are the key election night takeaways on a strong night for Democrats:As Ohio goes, so goes the nation?

100,Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocks pregnant woman from emergency abortion,"CNN —

The Texas Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a pregnant woman from obtaining an emergency abortion in a ruling issued late Friday.

The court froze a lower court’s ruling that would have allowed Kate Cox, who sued the state seeking a court-ordered abortion, to obtain the procedure. “Without regard to the merits, the Court administratively stays the district court’s December 7, 2023 order,” the order states.

The court noted the case would remain pending before them but did not include any timeline on when a full ruling might be issued. Cox is 20 weeks pregnant. Her unborn baby was diagnosed with a fatal genetic condition and she says complications in her pregnancy are putting her health at risk.

Following the ruling, Cox’s attorney said they remain hopeful the state’s request is quickly rejected. “We are talking about urgent medical care. Kate is already 20 weeks pregnant,” said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “This is why people should not need to beg for healthcare in a court of law.”

The ruling came just hours after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton petitioned the high court to intervene in the case.

Paxton’s petition stemmed from a ruling on Thursday by a Texas judge who granted a 14-day temporary restraining order against the state’s abortion ban, so Cox could legally terminate her pregnancy.

The decision marked a significant development in the ongoing debate over the state’s medical exception to its controversial ban on abortions after six weeks – one of the strictest in the nation.

In the petition filings with the state Supreme Court, Paxton – who has threatened prosecution against anyone who helps facilitate the abortion – asked for an emergency stay of the district court judge’s ruling.

In a letter to three hospitals in Houston where, according to the Texas Medical Board, Cox’s physician has privileges, Paxton wrote Cox has failed to demonstrate she has a “life-threatening” medical condition related to her pregnancy or that her symptoms place her “at risk of death” or major bodily harm.

The state attorney general also warned the hospitals Thursday’s ruling “will not insulate you, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability,” including first-degree felony prosecutions and civil penalties of at least $100,000 for each violation.

Cox sought an emergency hearing to obtain an abortion after learning her unborn baby had trisomy 18, a fatal genetic condition, and is not expected to live more than a few days outside the womb, according to the suit.

Cox, 31, has been to three different emergency rooms in the last month due to severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks, according to her suit. She has had two prior caesarean surgeries – C-sections – and, the suit said, “continuing the pregnancy puts her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy.”

A ‘disregard’ for Cox’s life

Before the state’s Supreme Court weighed in, attorneys for Cox and the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights legal group representing Cox, said Paxton’s petition to block her procedure was “stunning” and showed a “disregard for Ms. Cox’s life, fertility, and the rule of law.”

“The State claims that it alone has the power to value Ms. Cox’s current nonviable pregnancy more highly than Ms. Cox’s own life and life of the future children she and her husband hope to have, regardless of Ms. Cox’s wishes for her family and the good faith advice of her medical team,” their response states.

The response goes on to say the plaintiffs agree the state Supreme Court should take urgent action, “specifically, to remind the Attorney General that he does not exist outside the systems of laws of which he is an officer, and that he must follow court orders just like the citizens he purports to serve.”

The filing also requests the state Supreme Court to reject Paxton’s threat of prosecution of the doctors and anyone else who helps facilitate the abortion.

Molly Duane, Cox’s attorney, would not say Thursday when and where Cox would be getting the abortion but said they planned to help get her the care “the fastest way” possible.

CNN —

In a court in Harris County, Texas, something remarkable happened this week: A woman and her husband asked a judge for an emergency order granting her permission to end a pregnancy.

Mary Zeigler Bill Lax/Bill Lax/FSU Photography Service

Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, had learned that the child she was carrying had full trisomy 18, a rare genetic condition that is almost always fatal. Her physicians have warned that continuing the pregnancy could put her at risk for life-threatening complications. Cox, who wants to have a third child, might also lose her ability to do so if forced to carry the pregnancy to term.

The judge granted Cox’s request on Thursday, but the state will almost certainly appeal to what is a Texas Supreme Court with nine Republican members. Late Friday, the Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocked the lower court’s ruling. But regardless of what happens next, Cox’s suit will shape the abortion debate going forward — not least because it is historic.

Cox is part of a new generation of plaintiffs telling heartbreaking stories about their experiences under criminal laws in places such as Texas, Idaho, Tennessee and Oklahoma — plaintiffs willing to speak out in a climate where support for abortion is at a record high, according to a WSJ-NORC poll, and some of the stigma surrounding abortion seems less intense. But given the popularity of abortion rights — and the obvious tragedy faced by women like Cox — why are states like Texas fighting so hard to defend their narrow exceptions?

The answer is that Cox’s case and others like it expose how unworkable abortion exceptions are under current law in states with virtual bans, especially when they are attached to harsh penalties like life in prison. Conceding that a woman like Cox is right could threaten to send much else about criminal abortion laws toppling down.

It is worth remarking on how rare Cox’s suit is. Before Roe v. Wade, patients and doctors both questioned the constitutionality of abortion laws. In some cases, pregnant patients were named plaintiffs: This was the case for Norma McCorvey, the “Roe” in Roe v. Wade, and Sandra Cano, the plaintiff in Roe’s companion case, Doe v. Bolton. These suits adjudicated whether a law was permissible, but often did not change what happened to a particular pregnant plaintiff (McCorvey, for example, famously carried what some called the “Roe baby” to term). After Roe, minors acting without parental consent or notification sought court-ordered abortion under what were called “judicial bypass” laws, often also while maintaining anonymity.

Cox’s case is quite different. She is an adult, not a minor, and she has not concealed her identity. Her willingness to tell her story is no doubt due to her own strength and commitment, but our present political moment likely has something to do with it too. Poll after poll find strong, if not unprecedented, support for legal abortion, even in states where abortion bans are already in effect. Backlash to these bans — and to the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization — has made it easier for other women to describe their own experiences with criminal laws and to file suits of their own.

McCorvey and Cano used pseudonyms at a time when pursuing abortion rights might have come at great personal and political cost. Women like Cox and Amanda Zurawski, who is challenging the validity of Texas’s medical emergency exception to abortion, use their own names, and do so with the knowledge that most Americans support legal abortion — and all the more so in cases like theirs.

When states fight plaintiffs like Cox and Zurawski in court, it hardly helps Republicans already on the defensive about abortion. It is comparably easy to paint bans as heartless and extreme when the state shows no sympathy for women who stand to lose their fertility, health or lives.

Suits like Cox’s expose how hard it would be to devise a workable abortion exception. In theory, a functioning exception would advance the state’s interest in fetal life while offering a real opportunity for people in exceptional cases that the state deems deserving. But if a state requires harsh punishment — Texas, for example, authorizes life in prison for abortion — few doctors will be willing to gamble that they are interpreting the law correctly, even if an exception is relatively clear.

Most exceptions, it turns out, aren’t clear anyway, written not by physicians but by lawmakers who use the language of criminal law, and sometimes write more than one exception into various criminal abortion laws, as in Oklahoma. The broader and more compassionate a state makes an exception, the higher the odds that more plaintiffs like Cox will prevail, but that will require deference to patients and physicians that anti-abortion states focused on punishing abortion providers reject as a matter of principle.

Exceptions almost always leave out other tragic circumstances. Texas has a medical emergency exception, but dismisses a fatal fetal abnormality that could deprive Cox of the ability to have a third child as nothing different than what is experienced by “countless women who give birth every day.” The risk of death, the state says, is simply “not imminent” enough. Andy Beshear, the Democratic governor of Kentucky, just made anger about a similar provision in his state’s law a central message of his successful reelection campaign.

Republican lawmakers often seem to want it both ways on abortion. They define themselves as pro-life but insist on compassion for women, especially in the so-called hard cases like Cox’s.

But what is happening in Texas complicates that narrative. Texas purports to value fetal life and women’s health — but then denies that the unborn have rights when that strategy will help defeat a lawsuit brought by a prison employee forced to stay at her post who lost her pregnancy. Texas claims compassion for women but requires that their lives or a major bodily function be at imminent risk before a doctor can step in. And Texas claims to protect life by forcing a woman like Cox to carry a child who almost certainly won’t live while threatening her ability to have a child who will.

All of this is a reminder of the priorities of state abortion laws, which are not about the value of life in the womb, but about criminal punishment — and about crafting exceptions that will rarely, if ever, be used. Cox’s suit matters because it is historic, but also because of what it tells us. When the chips are down, given a choice between protecting women like Cox and criminalizing those who offer abortions, we know what states like Texas will choose every time.","['exposing', 'exception', 'laws', 'truth', 'texas', 'states', 'women', 'opinion', 'life', 'law', 'chilling', 'woman', 'abortion', 'cox', 'state', 'roe']","Conceding that a woman like Cox is right could threaten to send much else about criminal abortion laws toppling down.

103,Kentucky woman approximately eight weeks pregnant files lawsuit challenging state’s abortion bans,"CNN —

A Kentucky woman who is approximately eight weeks pregnant and is seeking an abortion filed a class action lawsuit Friday, challenging the state’s two abortion bans.

The woman, identified as Jane Doe, brought the suit to the Jefferson County Circuit Court to challenge the state’s trigger law and six-week abortion ban because, “the government has denied her access to the care she needs,” the American Civil Liberties Union said in a news release.

It marks the first time a pregnant woman in Kentucky has filed a lawsuit of this kind, ACLU of Kentucky spokeswoman Angela Cooper told CNN.

The lawsuit, filed by Jane Doe and Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai’i, Alaska, Indiana and Kentucky, comes one day after a Texas judge ruled Kate Cox, a woman who is 20 weeks pregnant, has been granted permission to obtain an emergency abortion.

Cox’s lawsuit is believed to be one of the first attempts in the country by an individual seeking a court-ordered abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, according to the New York Times. The decision to allow her an abortion also marked a significant development in the ongoing debate over Texas’ medical exception to its controversial ban on abortions after six weeks – one of the strictest in the nation.

In Kentucky, the trigger law, which was passed in 2019 and went into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, banned most abortions at any pregnancy stage, making them a felony offense, with very limited exceptions when necessary to prevent serious injury or save a patient’s life.

The near-total bans in both states outlaw abortion in most instances with no exceptions for rape or incest, making Kentucky and Texas two of 13 states banning or severely restricting abortion.

Jane Doe’s suit names Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron and other state officials as defendants. A spokesperson from the office of Kentucky’s Republican attorney general told CNN they are “reviewing the complaint.”

“I am a proud Kentuckian and I love the life and family I have built here. But I am angry that now that I am pregnant and do not want to be, the government is interfering in my private matters and blocking me from having an abortion,” the woman said in a statement provided by the ACLU.

“This is my decision – not the government’s or any other person’s,” she added. “I am bringing this lawsuit because I firmly believe that everyone should have the ability to make their own decisions about their pregnancies. I hope this case will restore abortion access in Kentucky, if not for me, then for the countless people in the future who deserve the autonomy to decide what is best for themselves and their families.”

Lawsuit covers all pregnant Kentuckians seeking abortion

Jane Doe filed the class action suit to include all pregnant women in Kentucky who may also want an abortion because they “are suffering medical, constitutional, and irreparable harm because they are denied the ability to obtain an abortion,” according to the court complaint.

“Jane Doe should have the power to make decisions about her body, and to access essential health care in her community, but Kentucky politicians have denied her that fundamental right,” said Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, in the news release. “Kentucky’s abortion bans violate the Kentucky Constitution, including its promise of protecting everyone’s right to privacy, which encompasses the right to access abortion.”

“These bans have harmed countless Kentuckians since going into effect last year, and we are relieved to be back in court to try to restore abortion access in Kentucky,” Amiri added.

Rebecca Gibron, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai’i, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, said in a Friday news conference, “Access to reproductive health care has been denied for far too long.”

“We know people in Kentucky agree with us because, in 2022, Kentuckians voiced their opinion by voting down the constitutional amendment that would have amended the state constitution to explicitly say that it does not protect the right to an abortion,” Gibron said.

In June 2022, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood were granted a restraining order and temporary injunction after they argued the state’s trigger law and six-week abortion ban violated pregnant Kentuckians’ constitutional rights to “privacy, bodily autonomy, and self-determination,” the ACLU said in an earlier news release.

The injunction was dissolved in February by the state’s Supreme Court, which ruled the circuit court wrongfully stopped the enforcement of two state abortion laws.

This year, health care providers and abortion activists have continued to file legal challenges to stop bans in several states from being enforced – and with abortion banned in more than a dozen states and restricted in many others, it has become about twice as common for people in the United States to travel across state lines for their abortion care.","['files', 'kentucky', 'states', 'lawsuit', 'court', 'approximately', 'woman', 'abortion', 'care', 'state', 'bans', 'pregnant', 'challenging', 'access', 'weeks']","CNN —A Kentucky woman who is approximately eight weeks pregnant and is seeking an abortion filed a class action lawsuit Friday, challenging the state’s two abortion bans.

104,Crowds at a ‘redneck Christmas parade’ come up with one solution for their troubles: Trump,"West Monroe, Louisiana CNN —

Bryan Baker stuck a roll of toilet paper on a paint roller that he’d attached to a leaf blower, and switched the leaf blower on. A stream of white paper shot into the air and fluttered delicately to the ground. It was Baker’s twist on a tradition of the Bawcomville Redneck Christmas Parade, where marchers throw toilet paper – as well as toothbrushes, ramen noodles, beads, and candy – at spectators along the road in West Monroe, Louisiana.

“We have Leroy the Redneck Reindeer,” Baker said, pointing to the stuffed deer head with a red nose on his float. “You can’t get any more redneck than that.”

“Redneck” doesn’t necessarily mean broke – there are plenty of expensive trucks in the parade. To Baker, redneck meant “We’d rather be out in the woods, be out in the country – sit back on the porch, bonfire, cold beer.”

But behind the jokes was a more serious reality. The parade route went past people living in an RV and a tent, abandoned stores, a pawn shop, and a couple Dollar Generals. More than 30% of Bawcomville residents live below the poverty line, and the surrounding Ouachita Parish was deemed a persistent poverty county in a 2022 report by the Congressional Research Service. A 2015 documentary called “The Other Side,” which follows a man addicted to meth, was filmed in Bawcomville. The area is well-known locally as a poor community in need of better housing, and there’s a derogatory definition of a resident on Urban Dictionary (“characterized by having at least two broke-down vehicles on their front lawn…”).

West Monroe residents told CNN the economic strife they see every day affects how they plan to vote next year.

Debi Mayo and Rachel Holmes were doing outreach at the parade for Bawcomville Hope, a non-profit that gives food and hot meals to the needy.

“People don’t realize this is kind of like a Third World country,” Holmes said. There were many homeless people in the area, living in abandoned mobile homes, she explained. “And in the woods,” Mayo added. “Makeshift tents.” They said homelessness was harder to see there than in the streets of the big cities.

“It’s a terrible situation we’re in. Even people with jobs are suffering because of the high price of the economy,” Mayo said.

As for the 2024 presidential election, Mayo said, “We hope Trump gets back in there. Maybe he can straighten it out … Because it wasn’t in this turmoil when he left. All this has managed to happen in the last three years.”

""It’s just not your typical Christmas parade,"" one participant said of the redneck-fest. Deborah Brunswick/CNN

Former President Donald Trump holds commanding leads among Republican voters but has to win the party nomination through state contests beginning in less than six weeks.

President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign has been touting “Bidenomics” – saying the economy has gotten better since the pandemic, a war in Europe, snarled supply chains and increased spending sent inflation to four-decade highs. Although economic metrics show that’s true – unemployment is at a historic low, low-income paychecks are bigger, inflation is falling – public opinion polls show that a majority of people still think the economy is bad.

Some commentary has suggested this is not rational. “Disproportionate doom seems to be a new American affliction,” a Financial Times columnist wrote in December. A September Bloomberg opinion column was headlined, “Risks Are Growing of a Double-Dip ‘Vibecession’” – “vibecession” being a term coined in June 2022 by Kyla Scanlon and picked up widely to express fears that gloomy economic views could become a self-fulfilling prophesy.

“That’s a big fat lie,” Toni Boler, a parade spectator, told CNN of analysts who said Americans just didn’t understand that the economy is actually better. “Just look at our pocketbooks … What little people may have been able to save from the stimuluses we got – all that is gone. People are living off credit now, if they even have that.” She said her property taxes, property insurance, and utility bills had gotten more expensive. “I don’t know how these families that come to this redneck parade – this community – even can buy groceries.”

Shane Wooten, a local real estate agent, said he’d bought hundreds of packets of ramen noodles to toss from a La-Z-Boy he’d propped on a motorized scooter to ride in the parade, a reference to a joke that rednecks snacked on dry noodles as they were cheaper than chips.

“It’s just not your typical Christmas parade. It’s something to laugh about,” Wooten said, dressed as the Grinch as the parade got ready in an elementary school parking lot.

A line of monster trucks was capped off by a monster VW bus with weed-smoking icons cut into the rims. Floats included one with with a man sitting on a toilet, signs reading “kiss ur cuzin” and “crack is wak,” boughs of empty beer cans, a nativity scene, a tractor, a trash truck, and many, many pickups.

In the crowd, Boler said she works with the Louisiana Department of Health, and that her job involved getting people “with serious mental illness a way to get out of the nursing homes. But we really kind of hit a roadblock because there’s no place for people with mental illnesses to go … There’s no housing for people.”

She added, “I think there’s a lot of the population that gets lost – that the administration is worried more about things they don’t need to be worried about, instead of what’s really going on with people that are out here trying to work.”

Louisiana is a deep red state, and none of the presidential campaigns will spend much money to win over voters here.

Jane Temple said she couldn’t wait for the general election for Trump to get back in and fix the economy. “We’re counting on him,” she said. “I think he cares. I may be wrong, but I think he does.” She said Trump wasn’t perfect but added, “For the most part, when he was in office, even with everything going on, he accomplished a lot.” As for Biden, Temple said: “I don’t think that he has a clue.”

William Thompson owns a convenience store in the area. Working there, he’d seen a lot of people struggle with meth and fentanyl. “I blame Biden for that, too,” he said. Given the chance, he will be voting for Trump in 2024, he said, “because he’s the only president in my knowledge who’s given back to the people and helps the people.”

“If he’s in jail, I’d vote for him,” Thompson said.","['parade', 'mayo', 'hed', 'redneck', 'crowds', 'think', 'christmas', 'trump', 'deborah', 'troubles', 'solution', 'dont', 'theres', 'come', 'economy']","“We have Leroy the Redneck Reindeer,” Baker said, pointing to the stuffed deer head with a red nose on his float.

105,"A ‘tyranny of the minority’ is destroying American democracy, a new book warns","CNN —

It started as a political protest in the nation’s capital over a disputed election, but it quickly turned into an all-out assault.

Armed right-wing militia and a mob of enraged demonstrators stormed the building where lawmakers had gathered to vote on a new government. The insurrectionists tried to break through the doors to the building where lawmakers met, but riot police stopped them at the barricades. As both sides battled one another on that chilly winter day, frightened lawmakers fled their chambers as the mob called for their hanging. Many people were injured, and some killed.

We’re talking, of course, about the insurrection of February 6, 1934 — an infamous day when thousands of fascists and militia members tried to topple a democratically elected government in France.

The French government survived that attack, but the political battle that followed proved to be more consequential. A committee was formed to investigate the insurrection, but right-leaning politicians rejected its findings and constructed an alternative narrative that cast the insurrectionists as victims of overzealous police and true patriots. No one was really held accountable, and politicians who encouraged or justified the insurrection that day remained in power.

A description of the 1934 riot comes midway through “Tyranny of the Minority: Why American Democracy Reached the Breaking Point,” by Steve Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt. Their new book, which argues that the US must reform its Constitution and political institutions because they are dangerously antiquated, offers a chilling postscript to the French insurrection.

“In the absence of accountability for the events of February 6, French democracy was badly weakened. Within six years, it would be dead,” the authors write.

Could the same fate await the US? This is the question that haunts every page of their impassioned book.

Schools often teach children that the Founding Fathers were political geniuses in powdered wigs who created a democratic system that remains envied throughout the world. But the “Tyranny of the Minority” makes another argument: The Founding Fathers didn’t intend to create what contemporary Americans would call a democracy.

The book’s authors say the Founding Fathers were progressive and even radical for their time, but they birthed a now-outdated political system that allows a partisan minority in the US to thwart the popular will and rule over popular majorities.

Levitsky and Ziblatt write with the same clarity that turned their previous book, “How Democracies Die,” into a bestseller. They direct some of their most pointed criticisms at contemporary politicians who they describe as “semi-loyal’ to democracy because they refuse to work with ideological rivals even when democracy is on the line.

The January 6 insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol building and the politicians who use openly authoritarian language are often depicted as the biggest threats to democracy. Yet “democracy’s assassins” always have political accomplices who appear to abide by democratic norms but quietly undermine them, the authors say.

“Many of the politicians who preside over a democracy’s collapse are just ambitious careerist trying to stay in office or perhaps win a higher one,” they write. “They do not oppose democracy out of deep-seated principle but are merely indifferent to it. They tolerate or condone antidemocratic extremism because it is the path of least resistance. These politicians often tell themselves they are doing what’s necessary to get ahead. But, ultimately, they become indispensable partners in democracy’s demise.“

Levitsky and Ziblatt recently talked to CNN. Their comments were edited for brevity and clarity.

You say in your book that America will either become a multiracial democracy or cease to be a democracy at all. Is that hyperbole? Is the choice really that stark?

Levitsky: Given the demographics of the country, it’s not hyperbolic at all. Given the numbers in this country, the only way to not empower the emerging multiracial majority in this country is through nondemocratic means. For many years in this country, prior to 1965 [when the Voting Rights Act was passed] when the demographics were different, we had what we called a democracy. But it was not providing rights and protection to all members of the community. It’s only in 1965 that we started to have this conversation about a true multiracial democracy.

One former Republican governor recently called Trump “f ***ing crazy” and a “three-time loser.” But when asked if he would vote for him in the next presidential election he said yes, because “I just want Republicans to win.” Is this an example of the type of politician you say is “semi-loyal” to democracy?

Ziblatt: Yes. The test that we propose for being committed to democracy is that you of course have to reject violence. You have to accept election results. That almost goes without saying. There is a third really essential criteria, which is that you distance yourself from, you condemn, and you do not support people who engage in those first actions. That’s when democracies get in trouble. That’s what we’re seeing with political leaders who say a person is a threat to democracy, they won’t recognize elections and that’s unacceptable. But then they simply turn a blind eye for partisan reasons.

The parallels you draw between what happened in Paris on February 6, 1934, and what happened in Washington on January 6 are pretty unsettling. What is the lesson of February 6 for Americans today?

Ziblatt: The lesson is that if you don’t hold bad actors to account legally and politically, then you are putting your democracy at grave threat. So you need to of course hold people who attack Congress or parliament buildings to account legally, but they also have to be held accountable politically. You need to take a sharp stand against political leaders who participate in this because if you don’t, these same actors will come back another day and do serious damage.

White racial resentment over changing demographics in the US and perceived loss of status is central to Donald Trump’s appeal to many voters, the authors of a new book say.

A lot of books and articles have warned that Trump is destroying democracy and becoming an authoritarian leader. Scholar Robert Kagan recently wrote a widely shared essay with the headline, “A Trump dictatorship is increasingly inevitable. We should stop pretending.” Is the fear of Trump become a dictator exaggerated?

Levitsky: I’m glad Bob wrote that piece because I think that we are continuing to sleepwalk through a very dangerous situation. Donald Trump’s campaign this year is the most openly authoritarian campaign I’ve seen (from) any candidate anywhere in the world since World War II. He is publicly promising to do things that I’ve never seen any candidate anywhere in the world promise to do since World War II. Hugo Chavez didn’t say these things. [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan didn’t say these things. [Viktor] Orban didn’t say these things. Even [Vladimir] Putin didn’t say these things when he first ran for office.

In the book, you said the Founding Fathers were quite radical and progressive for their time, but they did not aspire to build what we call a democracy today. I think that would surprise most people. Could you explain?

Ziblatt: What was radical about what they were proposing to do is that they were trying to create a large political system without a king. That was radical. And so was giving power to citizens even in a limited scope to determine the form of government. They were not interested in making a modern representative democracy as we have today insofar as they were not interested in having full voting rights for everybody or full civil rights. That only came about over time, over the course of the 20th century.

What role did race play in the creation of the Electoral College?

Levitsky: It did have a role. The framers were almost operating completely blind in devising a system to select the president. We were the first large state in modern history to try to elect a government that wasn’t a king, and they had no idea how to do it. There were some in the Constitutional Convention who advocated for a direct popular vote for the president. But it was voted down in part because Southern slave states worried that they would be outnumbered by the North, and that would put slavery at risk. The Southern slave states objected to a direct presidential election because they feared they would lose and that would put slavery at risk. The compromise solution, after all the other alternatives were voted down, was the Electoral College.

You write that White racial resentment was central to the rise of Donald Trump. But some critics have pointed out that there were other sources for Trump’s popularity, like his defense of gun rights and his nostalgic patriotism. Is citing White racial resentment too simplistic in explaining Trump’s popularity?

Levitsky: Voters are complex. You can’t make perfect generalizations about any voting bloc. And they don’t vote only because of their ethnic background. I don’t think that takes away from the argument, and there’s an awful lot of data behind the fact that especially in the primaries — but also in the general election — one of the prime factors associated with support for Trump was White racial resentment, or a view that American society and culture are changing in ways that are deeply threatening. It’s much more complex than a racial vote. It’s better characterized as about status loss.

For a couple hundred years in this country, White men sat on top of every single social political, economic, and cultural hierarchy that we had. That is changing quite rapidly over the last few decades. And we’ve really begun in the 21st century to see the effects of that change, whether it’s an African American family in the White House or nonwhite or mixed-race families on television screens, or discussions in newsrooms or in classrooms questioning long-established narratives of history that downplayed or ignored race.

These things are happening in the 21st century in a way that never happened before and are seriously challenging the long-established racial hierarchy. And there’s pretty good evidence that this has … not only given rise to MAGA but is its principal contributor.

You write in your book about American democracy reaching a breaking point, and this being an unprecedented moment. But critics say there was, for example, more political violence in the late 1960s. The country seemed to be coming apart then with civil disorder and political assassinations.

Levitsky: One fundamental difference between the late Sixties and today is that in the late Sixties, the political conflict and violence were not partisan. The two major parties, from top to bottom, were not very polarized and remain committed to playing by the democratic rules of the game. The two major parties were able to eventually maintain the democratic system and eventually muddle through without great damage to our democracy.

The difference now is that one of our two major political parties is no longer committed to democracy. And you’ve got to go back to Reconstruction to find that. When this level of political polarization, conflict and even violence enters the party system and becomes politicized in this way, it’s much more dangerous for our democracy. That’s why nothing remotely like January 6th or the effort to overturn an election occurred in the late Sixties.

How worried are you as you look toward next year’s presidential election?

Ziblatt: The prospect of a Trump presidency should frighten all of us. We should take his promises very seriously. He’s advertising his authoritarianism. The good news is most Americans actually are liberal minded, committed to democracy. They don’t want a political system that’s authoritarian. The bad news is that the coalition that is in support of that could easily fracture. It’s a big coalition, and there are a whole set of factors that could weaken that coalition and fracture it. The war between Israel and Hamas could drive a perfect wedge in the broad coalition against Trump.

We have to keep our eye on the prize, and we have to understand that the most essential thing for any American is to make sure that you don’t elect an autocrat. All other issues are secondary.

106,"Live updates: Israel-Hamas war, US vetoes UN resolution calling for Gaza ceasefire","Images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday showed a mass detention by the Israeli military of men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle. Obtained by CNN

The Israeli military is apprehending military-aged men in northern Gaza to “work out who the terrorists are,” the Israeli Government spokesperson told CNN on Friday.

Eylon Levy was responding to questioning from CNN’s Brianna Keilar about images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday, which showed men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds, and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle.

“When we find military-aged men in areas that we have been urging an evacuation of for over a month – because these are Hamas strongholds where we have seen intense urban fighting – we need to apprehend those people, work out who the terrorists are,” Levy said.

Those who are determined not to be “terrorists” will be released, he added.

At least some of the men detained as part of the operation depicted in the social media images were civilians with no known affiliation to militant groups, according to a conversation CNN had with one of their relatives and a statement by one of their employers, a news network.

The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said Friday that dozens of suspects arrested by Israel in Gaza had been taken to Israeli territory for questioning.

“The people we’re seeing in these images are all suspected terrorists,” Levy said.

“We wish that all Hamas fighters were wearing uniforms that clearly said Hamas on their helmets, because that would make them easier to identify them. But when Hamas dresses up as civilians, and fights within civilian areas, they make it very difficult to find them.”

Some context: The Israeli military for weeks told Gazans to leave northern Gaza, and head south. Now that the Israeli military has invaded southern Gaza, it has told Gazans to head for a small strip of land in southwestern Gaza, along the Mediterranean coast.

But the main UN agency working in the Palestinian territories, UNRWA, says there is no such thing as a “safe zone” in Gaza. “The entire Gaza Strip has become one of the most dangerous places in the world,” it said in a statement. “There is nowhere to go as shelters, including UNRWA, are overflowing.”

107,Al-Nasr hospital: Infants found dead and decomposing in evacuated Gaza ICU. Here’s what we know,"Editor’s Note: The following story includes graphic material. Audience discretion is advised.

CNN —

The scene inside the Al-Nasr hospital ICU ward is chilling. The tiny bodies of babies, several still attached to wires and tubes that were meant to keep them alive, decomposing in their hospital beds. Milk bottles and spare diapers still next to them on the sheets.

The video inside the hospital was filmed on November 27 by Mohamed Baalousha, a Gaza reporter for UAE-based news outlet Al Mashhad. He shared an unblurred version with CNN, which shows the remains of at least four infants.

Three of them appear to be still connected to hospital machines. The bodies of the babies appear to be darkening and disintegrating from decay, with little more than skeletons left in some of the beds. Flies and maggots are visibly crawling across the skin of one child.

The circumstances around one of the most horrifying videos to emerge from the war in Gaza remain unclear, but after days of piecing together available information, using interviews, published statements and video, a chaotic scene can been painted of hospital staff trying to protect their most vulnerable patients, caught in the middle of a raging battle – waiting for help that never arrived.

Here is what CNN found

CNN geolocated the video to Al-Nasr hospital in northern Gaza. This area has been largely unreachable to journalists in recent weeks due to the intensity of fighting but during the seven-day truce Baalousha says he was able to access the hospital to film what was left there.

From early November, the Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi children’s hospitals, which form part of the same complex, had become the frontline of fighting between Israeli and Hamas forces.

In public statements and interviews, several medical staff and health officials from Al-Nasr said they had to hurriedly evacuate the hospital on November 10, under the direction of Israeli forces.

Medical staff described having to leave young children behind in the ICU because they had no means to safely move them.

A doctor associated with the hospital, who did not want to be named, told CNN that two of the children – a two-year-old and a nine-month-old baby – had died shortly before the evacuation but that three children were left alive still connected to respirators. One of those left alive was two months old. Several of the infants on the ICU had been suffering from genetic disorders, according to the doctor.

The condition of those left behind alive – both at the time the fighting reached the hospital and when the evacuation took place – remains unclear.

In a video on November 9, the head of Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi pediatric hospitals, Dr. Mustafa al-Kahlout, said Al-Nasr hospital had been “struck twice” sustaining “a lot of damage.”

Kahlout warned oxygen to the ICU “was cut off” and reported at least one patient had died as a result, with others facing the risk of death.

It’s unclear whether oxygen cylinders, seen next to some of the beds in the video from the hospital, were functioning or whether supplies had run out.

“The situation is really bad, we are surrounded… ambulances cannot reach the hospital, and ambulances that tried to reach Al-Nasr were targeted,” Kahlout said, calling on international organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to intervene and save the medical staff and patients who remained in the ICU.

Video shared on social media on November 9, which CNN verified, was filmed from inside Al-Nasr hospital and appears to show the aftermath of the building being hit.

Another from November 10 showed an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tank outside Al-Nasr, indicating the IDF was operating in the area. Another video from the same date showed civilians holding up makeshift white flags attempting to flee the hospital amid gunfire, then being forced to run back inside. It is not possible to tell from the video who is shooting.

Satellite imagery reviewed by CNN from November 11 shows large craters around the hospital complex, indicating the area had been under bombardment, making evacuation difficult.

But, in an audio recording of a conversation between a senior official at Al-Rantisi hospital and an officer from COGAT, which coordinates the Israeli government’s activities in the Palestinian territories and Gaza, it appears Israeli forces instructed hospital patients and staff to evacuate.

In the recording, released by the IDF on November 11, the Israeli officer assures the hospital official that ambulances will be arranged.

The hospital official tells the COGAT officer that ambulances cannot reach the hospital, and the officer replies: “I’ll arrange coordination with the primary aid center. Don’t worry, I’m near the army, it will be okay.”

“Will the ambulances take the patients and the medical staff?” the hospital official asks.

“No problem,” the COGAT officer responds, in the recording.

The hospital official then confirms that the COGAT officer is aware that people will be evacuating both Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi hospitals, and the COGAT officer says “yes, yes.”

But hospital officials say the ambulances never arrived.

“Many of the patients were carried out by their families, ambulances couldn’t reach the hospital,” Kahlout said in a news conference on November 14, following the evacuation.

Three children were left in the ICU attached to hospital machines but without oxygen, Kahlout said.

In an audio recording from November 10 released by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) a nurse who the organization said was volunteering in a personal capacity, said the hospital had been shelled, hitting multiple floors, water tanks, and electricity and oxygen stations.

The nurse – who CNN is not identifying for security reasons – said Al-Nasr staff were given 30 minutes to evacuate by the IDF, adding no ambulances were able to reach the hospital.

“We walked out a little bit there was shooting around us,” he said in the recording. Then he said someone from the IDF told him “I’ll give you safe passage, you have from 1130am until 12 noon.”

“So, we walked out with our hands up in the air carrying white flags and carrying families and children,” the nurse said in the recording.

He said he managed to carry one baby with him as he escaped and handed it to an ambulance headed for the Al-Shifa hospital. But four children were left behind in the ICU according to the nurse, in a discrepancy from the number given by Kahlout.

“To leave my patient dying in front of my eyes is the hardest thing I have ever experienced, it’s indescribable, they broke our hearts, we couldn’t help them, we couldn’t take them, we barely left ourselves with our children, we are civilians, we are a medical crew, we are displaced civilians,” he said in the recording.

Over the past week, CNN has tried to speak to medical staff and hospital officials from Al-Nasr, but all have either said they are too afraid to speak or cannot be reached.

The director of Gaza’s hospitals at the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health, Dr. Mohammad Zaqout, told CNN that people in the hospital were forced to leave by the IDF.

“We were forced to leave them behind to die because we didn’t have a safe medical evacuation… we informed them that these children were on beds and couldn’t be evacuated. We held other children in our arms while being forced to evacuate,” Zaqout said.

The IDF has strongly denied responsibility for the deaths of the children in Al-Nasr ICU. “Given that the IDF did not operate inside the Al-Nasr hospital, these allegations are not only false but also a perverse exploitation of innocent lives, used as tools to spread dangerous misinformation,” the IDF said in a statement to CNN.

Asked repeatedly by CNN why it hadn’t provided ambulances for the evacuation, as the COGAT officer had promised in the recorded conversation with the hospital official, and if they were aware of the presence of children left in the ICU, as Zaqout alleged, the IDF did not directly respond.

During an online Q&A for journalists Saturday, IDF spokesman Doron Spielman dismissed the story as merely a “rumor.”

“There were no premature babies that decomposed because of the IDF. There were probably no babies that decomposed whatsoever,” Spielman said. “But Hamas is in charge of Nasr hospital, we are not occupying Nasr hospital.”

Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals as command centers and even as places to hold hostages.

Zaqout denies the allegation and has repeatedly called for “neutral entities, human rights organizations, and media outlets to enter the hospitals and verify for themselves that they are used solely for civilian and humanitarian purposes.”

CNN cannot independently confirm what state the children were in when they were left at the hospital. But Stefan Schmitt, a forensic scientist at Florida International University reviewed the video for CNN and said the level of decomposition of the infants was advanced.

Schmitt said he believed the room had not been disturbed since the children were left. “Those remains decomposed in situ, meaning they decomposed there on those beds,” he said. “You can see that from the bodily fluids that have leaked out over the time of decomposition.”

Schmitt also said one of the corpses appeared to be wrapped in fabric, possibly a shroud, noting there was no medical equipment attached to the body, suggesting the body may already have been dead or severely injured. The room appeared to have been abandoned in a hurry, Schmitt continued, noting the infant car seat and what appears to be a bag packed for one of the children next to its bed.

A statement from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health issued in response to the video of the babies’ remains said Al-Nasr nursing staff were ordered to leave by the IDF, who told them the ICRC was coming to evacuate the patients.

“Instead, their decomposed bodies were found in their beds,” reads the statement. “These babies drew their last breaths alone and died alone.”

The ICRC told CNN it received “several requests” for evacuation from hospitals in the north of Gaza, but due to the “security situation” it was “not involved in any operations or evacuations, nor did teams commit to doing so.” The ICRC added the footage of the deceased children was an “unspeakable tragedy.”

108,Harvard President apologizes for her comments during her congressional testimony in an interview with the student newspaper,"CNN —

The president of Harvard University apologized in an interview with the school’s student newspaper after facing widespread condemnation for her disastrous congressional testimony this week, in which she and other university presidents failed to explicitly say calls for genocide of Jewish people constituted bullying and harassment on campus.

“I am sorry,” Harvard University president Claudine Gay said to The Harvard Crimson on Thursday. “Words matter.”

The apology came just days after Gay, the president of the University of Pennsylvania and the president of MIT testified at a House committee hearing focused on antisemitism on campus, to widespread criticism that they have not done enough to ensure the safety of Jewish students and others at their respective schools.

Harvard, UPenn and MIT have all come under fire – along with other US academic institutions – over perceived inaction against antisemitism on their campuses, especially in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel and the subsequent war.

At UPenn, for example, President Liz Magill has been under pressure to resign for weeks, as major donors and others say they have lost confidence in her ability to lose the school.

Harvard is also among 14 colleges under investigation by the Department of Education “for discrimination involving shared ancestry” since the October attacks.

During Tuesday’s House hearing, Gay, along with the UPenn and MIT presidents, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

Gay told the Harvard student paper that she regretted what she said.

“When words amplify distress and pain, I don’t know how you could feel anything but regret,” she said to The Crimson.

“I got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures,” Gay told the newspaper. “What I should have had the presence of mind to do in that moment was return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our Jewish community — threats to our Jewish students — have no place at Harvard, and will never go unchallenged.”

“Substantively, I failed to convey what is my truth,” she added.

The Harvard president told the paper she’s heard about how much pain students are in over the past few months.

“To contemplate that something I said amplified that pain — that’s really difficult,” Gay said to The Crimson. “It makes me sad.”

Flood of criticism

Gay has faced plenty of calls to resign, most notably from Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, a Harvard graduate who has been a vocal critic of how universities have addressed antisemitism on campus

“Throughout the hearing, the three behaved like hostile witnesses,” Ackman wrote in a post on X earlier this week, “exhibiting a profound disdain for the Congress with their smiles and smirks, and their outright refusal to answer basic questions with a yes or no answer.”

“They must all resign in disgrace,” Ackman said.

But the criticism from donors, politicians, alumni and business leaders has been reserved mostly for UPenn’s Magill, who appears most imminently at risk of losing her job. She faces a donor rebellion, including a threat from one donor to pull a $100 million gift. The Wharton board also said it wants Magill ousted.

Underscoring the anger at the three university presidents’ testimony, on Friday a bipartisan group of more than 70 US lawmakers sent a letter to board members of all three universities, demanding the dismissal of Gay and the presidents of UPenn and MIT.

“Given this moment of crisis, we demand that your boards immediately remove each of these presidents from their positions and that you provide an actionable plan to ensure that Jewish and Israeli students, teachers, and faculty are safe on your campuses,” the lawmakers wrote.

“The university presidents’ responses to questions aimed at addressing the growing trend of antisemitism on college and university campuses were abhorrent,” the bipartisan group added.

Magill, like Gay, clarified her remarks Wednesday, a day after the controversial testimony. Magill said in a short video that she should have been more forceful in her condemnation of hate speech, particularly calls for genocide.

“I was not focused on – but I should have been – the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It’s evil. Plain, and simple,” Magill said in a video posted on X. “I want to be clear: A call for genocide of Jewish people … would be harassment or intimidation.”

Unlike Gay, however, Magill has not apologized for her testimony.","['gay', 'newspaper', 'comments', 'presidents', 'upenn', 'university', 'congressional', 'apologizes', 'student', 'president', 'testimony', 'jewish', 'students', 'harvard', 'interview', 'magill']","CNN —The president of Harvard University apologized in an interview with the school’s student newspaper after facing widespread condemnation for her disastrous congressional testimony this week, in which she and other university presidents failed to explicitly say calls for genocide of Jewish people constituted bullying and harassment on campus.

109,Two students claim the University of Pennsylvania has violated the Civil Rights Act by not protecting Jewish students from antisemitism on campus,"CNN —

Two Jewish students from the University of Pennsylvania have filed a discrimination lawsuit against the Ivy League institution, alleging it “has transformed itself into incubation lab for virulent anti-Jewish hatred, harassment and discrimination.”

In their suit, filed Tuesday in the US District Court For the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the students claim that the university is in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for failing “to remedy the hostile environment on its campus,” which has “placed plaintiffs and other Jewish and Israeli students at severe emotional and physical risk.”

“We are aware that a complaint was filed but have not had an opportunity to review it. We don’t comment on pending litigation,” a university spokesman told CNN.

The suit mentions several incidents on campus from before and after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel when it says the university failed to enforce its own policies and protect Jewish students.

According to the suit, since the October 7 attack,“many have engaged in harassment and violence against Jewish students in support of Hamas’s attack and in condemnation of Israel’s self-defense response.”

One of the plantiffs in the lawsuit says that on October 9, while walking on campus wearing garb that identified her as Jewish, including a Star of David, she walked by a group of pro-Palestine protestors.

One of the protestors yelled to her, “you are a dirty Jew, don’t look at us,” she said.

Other protestors joined in, taunting Davis with: “keep walking you dirty little Jew,” “you know what you’ve done wrong,” it says.

The suit claims “Jewish students have been forced to endure deliberate and targeted harassment by Penn’s faculty.”

“Penn has issued at least seven policies designed and intended to protect students from discrimination, harassment, and intimidation,” the suit says, adding that the university’s “assertions, assurances, and representations have proven false. As alleged in detail herein, Jewish and Israeli students are routinely targeted for antisemitic discrimination, harassment, and intimidation, without consequence, by their peers and professors.

The students are asking the court to prevent Penn from establishing, maintaining or executing policies that “penalize or discriminate against Jewish students,” including the termination of “deans, administrators, professors and other employees responsible for the antisemitic abuse permeating the school,” the suspension or expulsion students involved in antisemitic conduct, the addition of antisemitism training for the university community and compensatory and punitive damages.

The suit comes amid turmoil at the university that has put a cloud over President Liz Magill’s future, after her testimony during a House hearing on campus antisemitism was widely condemned as insensitive to the concerns of Jewish students, leading to widespread calls for her ouster and an emergency college trustee meeting.","['suit', 'rights', 'policies', 'antisemitic', 'university', 'claim', 'violated', 'pennsylvania', 'protecting', 'students', 'civil', 'campus', 'harassment', 'filed', 'jewish', 'discrimination']","We don’t comment on pending litigation,” a university spokesman told CNN.

110,Why UPenn President Liz Magill is facing more pressure than other university presidents over antisemitism,"New York CNN —

Numerous college presidents are facing criticism about their responses to antisemitism on their campuses. But none more than University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill.

Some have called for the resignations of Harvard University President Claudine Gay and MIT President Sally Kornbluth after they testified along with Magill before a House committee Tuesday about campus antisemitism, and the presidents did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment. Instead, the school leaders explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

But Magill appears to be the university president most imminently at risk of losing her job, because Penn’s campus has been roiled by controversies about the conflicts in the Middle East for longer than other schools – and Magill’s multiple unsuccessful attempts to satisfy critics have resulted in an uproar from donors and tumult on the school’s board.

The University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees met Thursday consider her status. But a university spokesperson told CNN on the record that “there is no board plan for imminent leadership change.”

An ongoing crisis at Penn

In September, weeks before the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the University of Pennsylvania allowed speakers that Penn’s administration acknowledged had a history of making antisemitic remarks to participate in the “Palestine Writes Literature Festival” on campus.

In response to the criticism of the university’s decision to allow the controversial speakers, Magill and other top university administrators issued a statement that tried to satisfy both sides of the controversy but ended up angering both supporters of Israel and Palestinians.

“We unequivocally – and emphatically – condemn antisemitism as antithetical to our institutional values,” said the statement. But it added that “as a university, we also fiercely support the free exchange of ideas as central to our educational mission. This includes the expression of views that are controversial and even those that are incompatible with our institutional values.”

In response, 36 members of faculty at the school, before the festival was held, signed a letter criticizing that statement and Magill.

“It is equally important for us as educators to declare our support for Palestinian artists and writers, making it clear that we condemn antisemitism as well as Islamophobia and the oppression of Palestinians,” said the letter. “We ask that as leaders of the Penn community, you immediately amend your statement so that it is clearly in support of a diversity of views and diversity of religious, racial, and cultural communities on campus.”

Numerous donors also approached Magill and the school about the festival and Penn’s tepid response. Weeks later, when Hamas attacked Israel and killed at least 1,200 people, that simmering resentment turned into a boil of anger.

Some high-profile and deep-pocketed donors announced they would end their support of the school if she remained, Magill soon after issued another statement that attempted to bring the sides together, but that did little to quiet the criticism.

“I categorically condemn hateful speech that denigrates others as contrary to our values,” Magill said. “In this tragic moment, we must respect the pain of our classmates and colleagues and recognize that our speech and actions have the power to both harm and heal our community. We must choose healing, resisting those who would divide us and instead respect and care for one another.”

Unable to satisfy critics

But it’s that desire to keep both sides of the controversy happy that caused her so much trouble. And the her testimony this week before a House committee hearing on antisemitism on college campuses.

When Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik asked Magill whether calling for the genocide of Jews would violate Penn’s code of conduct, Magill answered “It is a context dependent decision.”

It sparked new calls for her resignation, including from Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. However despite its name, the University of Pennsylvania is a private school, not a state-funded school.

In a short video released Wednesday night, Magill said the university would immediately review and clarify its policies on hate speech.

“I was not focused on – but I should have been – the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It’s evil. Plain, and simple,” Magill said in a video posted on X. “I want to be clear: A call for genocide of Jewish people … would be harassment or intimidation.”

Magill noted antisemitic speech is designed to threaten and terrify Jews and remind them of the Holocaust, pogroms and other recent acts of violence against them.

“As president, I’m committed to a safe, secure and supportive environment so all members of our community can thrive,” Magill added. “We can – and we will – get this right.”

But so far, few of her critics believe she has gotten it right, and calls for her ouster have only gotten louder.","['penns', 'genocide', 'liz', 'support', 'upenn', 'presidents', 'university', 'facing', 'statement', 'president', 'school', 'pennsylvania', 'antisemitism', 'pressure', 'magill']","New York CNN —Numerous college presidents are facing criticism about their responses to antisemitism on their campuses.

CNN —

When one thinks of America’s greatest strengths, the kind of assets the world looks at with admiration and envy, America’s elite universities would have long been at the top of that list. But the American public has been losing faith in these universities – and with good reason.

Three university presidents came under fire this week for their vague and indecisive answers when asked whether calling for the genocide of Jews would violate their institution’s code of conduct. But to understand their performance we have to understand the shift that has taken place at elite universities, which have gone from centers of excellence to institutions pushing political agendas.

People sense the transformation. As Paul Tough has pointed out, the share of young adults who said a college degree was very important fell from 74% in 2013 to 41% in 2019. In 2018, 61% of Americans said higher education was headed in the wrong direction, and only 38% felt it was on the right track. In 2016, 70% of America’s high school graduates were headed for college. Now that number is 62%. This souring on higher education makes America an outlier among all advanced nations.

American universities have been neglecting excellence in order to pursue a variety of agendas — many of them clustered around diversity and inclusion. It started with the best of intentions. Colleges wanted to make sure young people of all backgrounds had access to higher education and felt comfortable on campus. But those good intentions have morphed into a dogmatic ideology and turned these universities into places where the pervasive goals are political and social engineering, not academic merit.

As the evidence produced for the recent Supreme Court case on affirmative action showed, universities have systematically downplayed the merit-based criteria for admissions in favor of racial quotas. Some universities’ response to this ruling seems to be that they will go further down this path, eliminating the requirement for any standardized test like the SAT. That move would allow them to take students with little reference to objective criteria. (Those who will suffer most will be bright students from poor backgrounds, who normally use tests like the SAT to demonstrate their qualifications.)

In the humanities, hiring for new academic positions now appears to center on the race and gender of the applicant, as well as the subject matter, which needs to be about marginalized groups. Based on conversations with dozens of academics, my impression is that today a White man studying the US presidency does not have a prayer of getting tenure at a major history department in America. Grade inflation in the humanities is rampant. At Yale College, the median grade is now an A. New subjects crop up that are really political agendas, not academic fields. You can now major in diversity, equity and inclusion at some colleges.

The ever-growing bureaucracy devoted to diversity, equity and inclusion naturally recommends that more time and energy be spent on these issues. The most obvious lack of diversity at universities, political diversity, which clearly affects their ability to analyze many issues, is not addressed, showing that these goals are not centrally related to achieving, building or sustaining excellence.

Out of this culture of diversity has grown the collection of ideas and practices that we have all now heard of — safe spaces, trigger warnings, and micro aggressions. As authors Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff have discussed, many of these colleges have instituted speech codes that make it a violation of university rules to say things that some groups might find offensive. Universities advise students not to speak, act, even dress in ways that might cause offense to minority groups.

With this culture of virtue signaling growing, the George Floyd protests erupted, and many universities latched on and issued statements, effectively aligning their institutions with these protests. By my memory, few took such steps even after 9/11 or during the Iraq War.

In this context, it is understandable that Jewish groups would wonder, why do safe spaces, micro aggressions, and hate speech not apply to us? If universities can take positions against free speech to make some groups feel safe, why not us? Having coddled so many student groups for so long, university administrators found themselves squirming, unable to explain why certain groups (Jews, Asians) don’t seem to count in these conversations.

Having gone so far down the ideological path, these universities and these presidents cannot make the case clearly that at the center of a university is the free expression of ideas and that while harassment and intimidation would not be tolerated, offensive speech would and should be protected. As CNN’s Van Jones has eloquently said, the point of college is to keep you physically safe but intellectually unsafe, to force you to confront ideas that you disagree with passionately.

What we saw in the House hearing this week was the inevitable result of decades of the politicization of universities. America’s top colleges are no longer seen as bastions of excellence but as partisan outfits, which means they will keep getting buffeted by these political storms as they emerge. They should abandon this long misadventure into politics, retrain their gaze on their core strengths and rebuild their reputations as centers of research and learning.","['groups', 'universities', 'speech', 'political', 'presidents', 'opinion', 'university', 'college', 'americas', 'students', 'safe', 'diversity']","Three university presidents came under fire this week for their vague and indecisive answers when asked whether calling for the genocide of Jews would violate their institution’s code of conduct.

112,Chris Evert: Tennis great re-diagnosed with cancer,"CNN —

Tennis great and ESPN analyst Chris Evert announced she has been re-diagnosed with cancer and will not be part of the network’s coverage of the 2024 Australian Open.

“Since I was first diagnosed with cancer two years ago, I’ve been very open about my experience. I wanted to give all of you an update. My cancer is back,” Evert said in a statement on Friday.

Evert, who won 18 grand slam singles titles and three grand slam doubles titles during her career, had previously announced she had been diagnosed with stage 1 ovarian cancer in January 2022. The former world No. 1 revealed that she had completed her treatment following her sixth and final chemotherapy session in May 2022.

“While this is a diagnosis I never wanted to hear, I once again feel fortunate that it was caught early. Based on a PET CT scan, I underwent another robotic surgery this past week. Doctors found cancer cells in the same pelvic region. All cells were removed, and I have begun another round of chemotherapy,” Evert said.

“I will be unable to join my colleagues when ESPN makes its return to Melbourne for the Australian Open next month. But I’ll be ready for the rest of the Grand Slam season! I encourage everyone to know your family history and advocate for yourself. Early detection saves lives. Be thankful for your health this holiday season.”

Evert’s younger sister, former professional tennis player Jeanne Evert Dubin, died from ovarian cancer in 2020 at the age of 62.

Born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1954, Evert went on to become one of the greatest players in the sport’s history, winning a women’s record seven French Open titles and a record six US Open titles. She became the first player to win 1,000 singles matches and the first female athlete to earn $1 million in career prize money.

When she was 15, she defeated the No. 1-ranked player in the world at the time, Margaret Court, in a tournament in Charlotte, North Carolina.

She was the first female athlete to host “Saturday Night Live” in 1989, the same year she retired. Six years later, Evert became a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, the fourth player to be elected unanimously.

Evert holds 157 singles titles and was the year-end world No. 1 for seven years: 1974 through 1978, 1980 and 1981.

She became a commentator and analyst for ESPN in 2011, a role she still holds today.

113,CosMc’s: Why McDonald’s is interested in a coffee chain,"New York CNN —

McDonald’s announced on Wednesday that it is piloting a new cafe concept called CosMc’s, which will mostly sell indulgent, highly customizable caffeinated beverages with some food. The first CosMc’s location is now open in Illinois, and nine more are planned in Texas in the coming months.

For many, the news probably raised one main question: Why? Why is a chain that’s basically synonymous with burgers suddenly interested in selling sugary coffee drinks? And why not just add those options to the menu at existing McDonald’s locations, rather than launch an entirely new brand?

And, perhaps most pressingly, why name it CosMc’s?

Those are head scratchers, at first. But there are a few good reasons for McDonald’s to take this approach.

Beverages are a lucrative market, and those wildly customizable coffee drinks – like the kind Starbucks is known for – especially so.

“There’s no category that has really performed better this year than specialty coffee,” said David Portalatin, senior vice president and food industry advisor at Circana, who noted that sales of specialty coffee at quick-service restaurants have risen this year compared to last.

But you can’t just plop a bunch of customizable coffee drinks onto the McDonald’s menu. Doing that would slow down kitchens and service times, and could confuse customers.

So to try to break into the market without messing up its regular business, McDonald’s is giving something totally new a shot.

Why McDonald’s wants in on specialty coffee

You might think that burgers are king at McDonald’s, and drinks little more than water, sugar and flavorings. But for restaurants, drinks — especially those kinds — are cash cows.

“The profit margin on a beverage is just humongous,” said John Gordon, founding partner of Pacific Management Consulting Group, which advises restaurants. A restaurant can see a gross profit margin of up to around 80% when selling beverages, he said — far higher than the margin for food. Plus, he added, when people visit a cafe for a drink, they often end up buying something to eat, as well.

And in the US, coffeeshops are a growing category, he said. “McDonald’s doesn’t want to be left behind.”

Beyond being left behind, McDonald’s is always looking to grow the business in new ways, even as Americans are already intimately familiar with the Big Mac.

During an investor event on Wednesday, McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said that “One area of focus has been identifying ways for McDonald’s to participate in attractive and fast-growing categories … we’ve honed in on specialty beverages and coffee.” McDonald’s, he said, could use specialty coffee to help it compete in the afternoons, using caffeine and sugar to entice people to come in for a pick-me-up between meals.

McDonald’s already serves coffee at its locations. But it doesn’t have the types of customizable espresso drinks, teas and other beverages that have helped raise sales for places like Starbucks.

Beverages from the CosMc’s menu Courtesy McDonald's

CosMc’s menu is full of them. Take, for example, the chai frappe burst, made with boba, whipped cream and cinnamon sprinkles. Customers can keep or ditch those items and add toffee sprinkles or “black pepper sprinkles,” according to the CosMc’s site. They can also add up to four espresso shots, a drizzle of caramel and/or chocolate, up to two types of flavored syrups and even a “boost” shot of vitamin c.

But McDonald’s can’t just start selling triple-shot chai frappe bursts — hold the whipped cream, add a pump of vanilla and chocolate drizzle — at regular McDonald’s locations. Kempczinski himself said on Wednesday they’re just too complicated for McDonald’s kitchens.

“Handcrafted beverages, customizations — things like that aren’t going to work at scale in a McDonald’s,” noted Joshua Long, a managing director and restaurant research analyst at Stephens. “And so they have to do it in a separate environment.”

Protecting the Arches

In recent years, McDonald’s has been focusing on reducing complexity for its workers. One way to do that is by focusing instead on its main menu items. Many of its most successful recent marketing campaigns — like the adult Happy Meal and celebrity meals platform — have offered McDonald’s items in different configurations, with maybe a few new sauces or toys. Focusing on the basics has helped McDonald’s increase sales.

Testing out a new line of complicated beverages would threaten those efforts. So by trying them out in a new concept that is affiliated with, but separate from McDonald’s, the company can experiment without risking disappointing its customers, or frustrating workers.

“They’re safeguarding the main brand by doing this in its own concept,” Long said.

But none of that explains why CosMc’s takes its name from an obscure McDonald’s character.

Who is CosMc, anyway?

CosMc’s is named after CosMc, a little-known McDonald’s character from the 1980s that Kempczinski on Wednesday described as “part alien, part surfer, part robot.”

CosMc doesn’t have the cachet of, say, the Hamburglar or Grimace. But that may be the point, said Stephen Zagor, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School who specializes in restaurants and food businesses.

“Because it is so unknown, it has a neutral response for customers,” Zagor said. “We’re starting with a blank slate.”

Still, there are plenty of signals to show customers that they’re visiting a location that is connected to McDonald’s.

“They’re using the golden arch, they’re using the terminologies. They’re using a lot of the logo colors that have made them successful,” Zagor said. Some of the food will be familiar to McDonald’s customers, too. A section of the online menu called “from the McDonald’s universe” includes Egg McMuffins and McFlurries, for example.

Still, “starting any business is risky, even for somebody that’s as experienced as McDonald’s,” Zagor said. “You’re trying to establish a whole new relationship,” with customers, he said. “And there’s always a chance that it’s not going to work.”

But for McDonald’s, there’s not much actual risk.

Low risk, high reward

During Wednesday’s event, Kempczinski stressed that the test is extremely limited. “Please, let me emphasize again, we’re talking about 10 stores,” he said.

For McDonald’s, which has about 41,000 locations worldwide, and wants to up that number to 50,000 by 2027, operating 10 stores is a drop in the bucket, financially. “This is a rounding error,” said David Henkes, senior principal at the research firm Technomic.

But it gives McDonald’s the opportunity to take risks it wouldn’t in McDonald’s locations.

“The value of CosMc’s is not necessarily in creating a new concept,” Henkes said. “It’s in the learning. And being free to learn, experiment, fail, try it again.”

McDonald’s could learn that there’s real money to be made, scale up the business and take on competitors like Starbucks and others. It might learn how to make customized drinks efficiently enough to bring them into its own kitchens. Or it could have takeaways from CosMc’s layout (the Illinois location has four drive-thrus) or marketing. Or something else entirely.

“It’s kind of an incubator, in a way, to test things out and see what sticks,” Henkes said, noting that some of the findings could be unexpected. “That’s the beauty of doing something like this.”","['beverages', 'menu', 'business', 'customers', 'food', 'cosmcs', 'specialty', 'chain', 'mcdonalds', 'interested', 'coffee', 'drinks']","Why is a chain that’s basically synonymous with burgers suddenly interested in selling sugary coffee drinks?

Debut “Bachelorette” Trista Sutter and husband Ryan Sutter are marking 20 years of marraige.

The couple, who got engaged on the series and later wed in a televised special, are among the few marriage success stories in the franchise.

Ryan Sutter marked their anniversary on Instagram, writing, “They never said it would be easy but this year was easily one of the craziest, most challenging, most unpredictable years of the 20 we’ve now spent together.”

“Big change and heartbreaking loss tested our resolve. We left a community and friends and a lifestyle - a safe harbor - for a new adventure and to make a new home. We struggled and we cried,” he wrote. “We laughed and we loved. We did it all and we did it together, like we always have.”

In August, Trista Sutter shared on social media that the family was relocating from their beloved Vail, Colorado to relocate to Denver. Over the years, they’ve dealt with some health issues and also mourned the recent loss of their family dog.

In his tribute to his wife for their anniversary Sutter wrote, “You and me, hand in hand, heart to heart.”

“It started in front of millions but today it’s just us. No wedding special, no fanfare, no red carpet,” he wrote. “Just Love. That’s all we’ve ever needed. I love you @tristasutter Now and forever. Happy Anniversary!!!”

CNN —

Taylor Swift is Time’s 2023 “Person of the Year,” and apparently, I’m the only millennial woman on Earth who doesn’t feel seen.

Holly Thomas Holly Thomas

OK, that’s an exaggeration. But since the announcement, it’s felt like a specific corner of Spotify Wrapped got bitten by a radioactive spider and attained superhuman powers.

I’m happy for her, I guess. I’ve nothing against a seemingly pleasant person having a lovely time, and there’s no denying she’s had a stellar year. As Time’s feature details, Swift’s now made more No. 1 albums than any other woman in history, has world leaders begging her to tour their nations and has reportedly become a billionaire. “Swift is the rare person who is both the writer and hero of her own story,” says Time. That’s great. I just don’t find that story especially compelling.

Ugh, I feel so mean. I’m well aware this will upset people, and I’d never want to rob anyone else of their joy. We’ve all had conversations with people who simply don’t “get” the music or TV we’re into. Typically, my response to such complaints is, “That’s OK, it wasn’t made for you.” But part of what’s making me so squirmy is the sense that Swift, and the stories she tells through her music, are basically aimed at me. If you lined me up alongside everyone I know who’s currently rhapsodizing over her success, I’d be indistinguishable. But I’m not biting. That’s not because I think there’s anything wrong with her. If anything, my choice for Time “Person of the Year” would be more problematic.

Historically, the title’s recipient has often been a provocateur. The idea isn’t necessarily that the “best” person wins — though that’s certainly been the case at times — it’s that the person who’s had the most influence, for “good or ill” over the previous 12 months, is recognized. Previous winners have included Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Greta Thunberg, Martin Luther King Jr. and Elon Musk. This year’s shortlist included the Hollywood strikers, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Barbie, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Trump prosecutors, King Charles III and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Time ultimately named Altman CEO of the year. I think he should have taken the top title.

In case he hasn’t yet crossed your radar, Altman is the 38-year-old chief executive of OpenAI, the tech startup responsible for creating ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a revolutionary generative artificial intelligence chatbot that was launched in November 2022. It’s since astounded observers by passing exams at law and business schools, writing effective job applications and computer code and composing part of a political speech for Israel’s president.

The implications of that tech alone are both miraculous and terrifying, particularly given the potential for disinformation campaigns to influence the presidential election in 2024. Many companies besides OpenAI are vying for a bite of the lucrative AI market, competing to develop newer, evermore sophisticated systems. Though the Biden administration recently introduced legislation to regulate the exploding industry, the pace of development is so rapid that it’s often difficult for governments to keep up.

The mysteriousness and speed of the AI race were evidenced in November, when, less than a year after ChatGPT’s launch, Altman was fired suddenly by his company’s board. Just days later, Microsoft, OpenAI’s biggest stakeholder, announced it was hiring Altman to head up a new AI team. This prompted a mass revolt among OpenAI’s staff, almost all of whom threatened to quit unless Altman was rehired. Within days, he was, and the board that’d fired him was replaced.

The circumstances around both Altman’s dismissal and rehiring were remarkably murky. In their statement announcing his sacking, the original board accused Altman of “being not consistently candid in his communications,” but didn’t elaborate on what that meant. Even more worrying, Altman’s return and the restructuring of OpenAI have been characterized as a victory for AI “accelerationists” — those who believe that the tech should be developed as fast as possible, unconstrained by safety concerns. The episode proved that Altman wasn’t just capable of spearheading potentially the most significant invention of the 21st century so far. He was able to upend the ecosystem that created it within days.

This, I think, is what’s lacking in Swift as Time “Person of the Year.” Her predominance in the entertainment industry is undeniable, but her story is essentially one of becoming mega-successful within an existing framework. As she told Time, we live in a patriarchal society fueled by money, so “feminine ideas becoming lucrative means that more female art will get made.” It’s not a million miles from, “If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.”

The impression that no one’s anticipating any controversy from Swift anytime soon was reinforced in November when Gannett, America’s biggest newspaper chain, hired the first-ever Swift correspondent. The journalist in question, 35-year-old Bryan West, is a self-avowed fan. Odd though some might find it to hire someone with such an obvious bias, West has argued that it’s no different than “being a sports journalist who’s a fan of the home team.” Whether you agree with that comparison or not, it’s undeniably in his professional interests for Swift to remain popular and relevant — and it seems unlikely that the appetite for stories about her will wane anytime soon.

This is why Altman, not Swift, ought to have been Time’s “Person of the Year.” His impact on the world could be exponentially more consequential, but not nearly enough people are aware of him or the implications of his technology. Every move Swift makes, however incidental, is the subject of feverish intrigue and speculation. Over in San Francisco, Altman is making moves that could change the fate of the world. And until a month ago, most of us were unaware he even existed.","['thats', 'speak', 'openai', 'think', 'opinion', 'taylor', 'doesnt', 'whos', 'world', 'ai', 'times', 'altman', 'swift', 'person']","CNN —Taylor Swift is Time’s 2023 “Person of the Year,” and apparently, I’m the only millennial woman on Earth who doesn’t feel seen.

116,NBA In-Season Tournament: Experiment reaches finale in Sin City. Has it worked?,"CNN —

The experiment to inject jeopardy into the November and December months of basketball – a long-held ambition of NBA commissioner Adam Silver – culminates this weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the T-Mobile Arena.

All 30 NBA franchises were placed into six groups of five teams at the beginning of the season based on last year’s records for the In-Season Tournament (IST).

Similar to European soccer tournaments, teams competed in a “Group Play” stage, with the group winners and two “wild cards” advancing to the “Knockout Round,” beginning with the quarterfinals which began on December 4. After the dust settled, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Indiana Pacers emerged as the final two teams and are now set to contest the inaugural NBA Cup scheduled for Saturday.

The idea behind the tournament was to create a formula to keep the players competitive and get the fans engaged.

The league even unveiled 30 new court designs for the event, with home teams also sporting their newly designed “City Edition” uniforms.

“We wanted the In-Season Tournament games to jump off the screen and immediately grab fans’ attention and felt like the bold colors of the courts accomplished that,” Chris Arena, the NBA’s head of on-court brand partnerships, told reporters.

The league is nearing the end of a nine-year, $24 billion media rights deal with ESPN and Turner Sports (now known as TNT Sports) – TNT Sports is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, as is CNN – and the next deal is projected to be worth more than double that amount.

However, over the last few years, the ratings for the league have been anti-climactic, plateauing across ABC, ESPN and TNT Sports.

For the 2022-23 season, the numbers dropped for both the regular season and for the NBA Finals, which suffered a 6% dip from 2022.

But for the IST’s “Group Play” stage, there was an average of 1.5 million viewers, a 26% increase in games watched across ESPN and TNT compared to November games from last season.

Local television saw a 20% rise in viewership and watch time on League Pass was up 25%, both compared to November dates from last year.

The NBA App, along with the league’s social media channels, had its best November to date, with the digital accounts seeing 3.9 billion video views.

TNT’s broadcast of the quarterfinal matchup between the Phoenix Suns and the Lakers saw an increase of 89% compared to last season’s window, averaging 1.97 million views.

Additionally, more people are physically going to the games. The league’s November attendance average marked the highest amount ever recorded for the month, at 18,206 people.

Meanwhile, players who were once skeptical are now motivated and eager to take home the new NBA Cup.

“In the beginning, we didn’t really know what it was, we just knew that money was on the line,” Milwaukee Bucks guard Damian Lillard told reporters ahead of his team’s quarterfinal clash with the New York Knicks.

“Then, over the course of time, I think everybody’s just owning it more and more, and now, it’s turned into real entertainment, real competitive basketball. We’re playing for something.”

Quarterfinals participants made $50,000 and the players on the teams which bowed out in the semifinals earned $100,000 for their appearance.

Players of the losing team in Saturday’s final will make $200,000 each, while the IST winners are set to receive a team trophy, individual medals and each player will be awarded $500,000 for winning the title.

The IST has also helped the league market players from lower-visibility teams, such as Pacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton.

Haliburton has stood out during the tournament for his performances and continued his brilliance in the Pacers’ 128-119 surprise semifinal win over the Bucks on Thursday night.

Haliburton, who didn’t have a turnover for the second straight game, finished with 27 points and 15 assists in the victory that clinched a spot in the IST championship game on Saturday.

“[The] In-Season Tournament has already created NBA monoculture moments with the national TV single-game windows,” The Athletic’s Mike Vorkunov posted on X, formerly Twitter.

“That allows people to see Tyrese Haliburton’s brilliance. So in one way, the IST is a success: it has minted a star. NBA always needs more of those and moments to build them.” Mike Vorkunov, National NBA reporter for The Athletic, on X

NBA commentator Rob Perez also posted on X: “Pacers were scheduled for 1 national tv game (ABC/TNT/ESPN) this season before their IST run. Haliburton + the franchise gets huge brand exposure they wouldnt have had w/o this success.”

What started off as an odd experiment to most players in the league and die-hard fans around the globe, the IST now looks like it could be around for years to come with both the stars and audiences going all-in.

The league invested a lot of time, brainpower and money into the rollout of the IST and the gamble appears to have paid off.

The NBA Cup final will take place at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC and ESPN2 on Saturday.","['inseason', 'pacers', 'city', 'ist', 'experiment', 'tournament', 'tnt', 'players', 'season', 'nba', 'finale', 'reaches', 'worked', 'league', 'teams', 'games', 'sin']","All 30 NBA franchises were placed into six groups of five teams at the beginning of the season based on last year’s records for the In-Season Tournament (IST).

117,European Union agrees to regulate AI development,"CNN —

European Union lawmakers struck a deal Friday agreeing to one of the world’s first major comprehensive artificial intelligence laws.

The landmark legislation, called the AI Act, sets up a regulatory framework to promote the development of AI while addressing the risks associated with the rapidly evolving technology. The legislation bans harmful AI practices “considered to be a clear threat to people’s safety, livelihoods and rights.”

The law comes amid growing fears about the disruptive capabilities of artificial intelligence.

In a news conference, Roberta Metsola, the president of the European Parliament, called the law “a balanced and human-centered approach” that will “no doubt be setting the global standard for years to come.”

The regulatory framework, which classifies AI uses by risk and increases regulation on higher risk levels, was first proposed in 2021.

The riskiest uses for AI are banned. According to the law, those include systems that exploit specific vulnerable groups, biometric identification systems for law enforcement purposes and artificial intelligence that deploys manipulative “subliminal techniques.”

Limited risk systems, such as chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, or technology that generates images, audio or video content, are subject to new transparency obligations under the law.

“The #AIAct is much more than a rulebook – it’s a launchpad for EU startups and researchers to lead the global AI race,” Thierry Breton, the EU Commissioner for Internal Market, wrote on social media. “The best is yet to come.”

Artificial intelligence broke into the mainstream with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. Seemingly overnight, generative AI technology exploded in popularity and spurred an AI arms race.

But AI’s disruption reaches far beyond the world of big tech: Educators have struggled with generative AI’s ability to complete schoolwork assignments; artists and musicians have grappled with the potential for AI-fueled imitation; and even the media industry has seen its controversies.

Some of the companies behind the technology have experienced growing pains, as well.

OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, was briefly ousted and then reinstated over the course of a few drama-filled days in November – with the exact reasons for the leadership changes still unclear, weeks later.

118,Republican candidates descend on western Iowa for Feenstra forum,"Sioux Center, Iowa CNN —

Four Republican presidential candidates will participate in a forum in Iowa on Saturday with GOP Rep. Randy Feenstra, with less than six weeks to make an impression on Iowa caucusgoers before the January 15 GOP caucuses.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Ambassador Nikki Haley, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Texas pastor Ryan Binkley were invited and will attend the event.

Feenstra invited the presidential hopefuls to his conservative corner of western Iowa for an event he’s calling, “Faith and Family with the Feenstras,” which will feature conversations with each of the candidates.

The candidates will get to share their message and pitch their vision for the country before an audience at the Christian college Dordt University in Sioux Center – which sits in Sioux County, a county that went for former President Donald Trump by a whopping nearly 67 percentage points in the 2020 presidential election.

The presidential field faces the challenge of trying to cut into Trump’s overwhelming lead in both state and national polls.

It’s the latest event that Iowans will get to hear from the candidates and compare them, following the contentious fourth GOP primary debate in Alabama earlier this week. DeSantis and Ramaswamy targeted Haley, hitting her on immigration, her record on China and foreign policy.

Trump decided to skip the debate and Binkley failed to qualify.

Much like the debate, Trump will be elsewhere on Saturday night: he’ll deliver the keynote speech for the New York Young Republican Club’s annual gala in New York City.

Other Republican candidates not attending Saturday’s event in Iowa are former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has prioritized campaigning in New Hampshire.

Feenstra, who was elected to Iowa’s 4th Congressional District in 2020 after defeating then-Rep. Steve King in the district’s Republican primary, has made a point to hold events with some of the candidates invited to Saturday’s event. US Sen. Joni Ernst and the three other GOP House members – Reps. Ashley Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn – have also hosted the candidates and introduced them at events.

Like the rest of the Iowa congressional delegation, Feenstra has not endorsed a presidential candidate ahead of the caucuses.

“We need a president who understands our values and will advance policies that support our families, defend our faith, and restore American prosperity,” the congressman said in a statement announcing the event.

The candidates will host other events in Iowa this weekend. DeSantis plans to attend a watch party later Saturday in Iowa for the 124th Army-Navy football game. And next week, he will participate in a CNN presidential town hall on Tuesday in Des Moines.

Haley will host town halls in Spirit Lake and Clear Lake on Saturday, and another in Waukee on Sunday.

Following the Feenstra event, Ramaswamy will hold events in that part of the state, hitting Sibley, Primghar and Cherokee. He then will campaign in New Hampshire before returning to Iowa for a presidential town hall with CNN on Wednesday.","['candidates', 'sioux', 'ramaswamy', 'forum', 'invited', 'gop', 'presidential', 'republican', 'western', 'descend', 'iowa', 'event', 'feenstra', 'town']","Sioux Center, Iowa CNN —Four Republican presidential candidates will participate in a forum in Iowa on Saturday with GOP Rep.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

CNN —

Former President Donald Trump is setting off many alarms. He made headlines by telling Fox News host Sean Hannity Tuesday night that if reelected, he would only be a dictator on “day one” of his presidency in retribution against his political enemies. There have been numerous reports on his plans to stack the executive branch in his favor through appointing loyalists and expanding his power to hire and fire federal government workers.

While Trump has always deployed this kind of language, and often his goal in doing so is to generate media attention rather than to outline serious policy objectives, there is reason to worry about an extraordinary assertion of presidential power that might very well take place in a second Trump term. There are significant reasons that the second time around would be different. And why Trump, who feels few restraints to begin with, would be even more unbound.

Why will would the second term be more dangerous than the first?

Lame duck freedom

Like all second term presidents, Trump would feel less constrained by having to worry about reelection. The virtue of being a lame duck is that there is much less pressure to avoid actions that might undercut the possibility of winning the support of future voters.

Some presidents try to use this freedom to advance controversial initiatives that would be in the best interest of the nation and the world, as President Ronald Reagan undertook in 1987 when he signed a major arms agreement (the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty) with the Soviet Union. But presidents can also use the lame duck period in dangerous ways, abandoning the guardrails on deploying power. This could certainly be the case with Trump who seems to have retribution rather than policymaking on his mind.

He’s already survived Impeachment (twice)

Trump is also in the unique position of having survived two impeachments while in office. The major mechanism that Congress has to prevent a president from abusing their power is not something likely to concern him. He has seen how partisanship is sufficient to insulate himself from the possibility of being removed by the Senate.

Trump also had a taste of how he could capitalize on being impeached by claiming to supporters that partisan opponents were out to get him and that he was a victim of the establishment. Knowing that, as former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney reminds us in her new book, Republicans saved him before and would do so again, the impeachment power of the legislative branch would not create any fears as he considered how to exercise presidential power.

He would have outflanked the law

If he was in office, that would mean that Trump has also survived, politically, the legal process again. Whether or not he is convicted in any of the four ongoing cases against him remains to be seen (he denies any wrongdoing). But should he be in office come 2025, it will mean that the legal process did not have the ability to change voting behavior and in certain respects made him stronger. Whereas President Richard Nixon needed President Gerald Ford to pardon him, Trump would have so much confidence that he would not even feel the need to worry about that sort of protection either.

His stranglehold on Republican loyalty

Notwithstanding the endless discussion about the Republicans who don’t like Trump, most in the GOP have continued to stand by him. Republicans on Capitol Hill have remained relatively steady in their support of the former president even if there has been some slippage. Those who are not standing with him, such as Cheney, have found themselves on the outside or out of a job.

In the electorate, the polls continue to show that regardless of what happens he remains far and above the most popular figure in the party. Trump knows all of this and will assume that if he gets in trouble the party will back him.

His cabinet would be filled with yes-persons

During his first term, Trump at least brought in figures from the world of Washington as well as the military to serve in his cabinet. Figures such as Secretary of Defense James Mattis and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus at least exposed him to some voices who understood when his ideas were going too far. Mattis served from 2017 until 2019 when Trump refused to listen to his warnings about removing troops from Syria. By 2020 Mattis was calling Trump a genuine threat to the Constitution. Priebus, a former member of Congress and head of the RNC, served as chief of staff for the first six months of Trump’s term, until he was kicked out.

A second term would be very different. As McKay Coppins wrote in The Atlantic, all indications are that this time around he would only staff his White House with the true loyalists. Figures such as Stephen Miller and Richard Grenell, former close aides in the first Trump administration, would push him toward even further extremes.

Experience

Trump now has experience. As chaotic as his term was, he would now have a much better sense of where it is possible to run roughshod over conventions and processes. He has tested the waters and will now have an easier time knowing what to expect when jumping back in.

Indeed, we have even seen in his approach to the 2024 primaries and convention a much more deliberate approach in thinking about how to set up conditions so to subvert his challengers. As with any second term president, he will be much more adroit at using the levers of power, legitimate and otherwise, to pursue his goals and to solidify his strength.

The real threat of vengeance

Perhaps the biggest factor of all is that Trump is out for revenge. He is angry at the opposition he has continued to face and the prosecutions that have been conducted under the Justice Department.

Trump, who has always been a person seeking to oust those who harm him or disagree with him, will now be able to do so using the long arms of government. For those who don’t believe that this is a serious threat, they should remember the long history of presidents, from President Woodrow Wilson during WWI to President Richard Nixon, who used the government to intimidate, crack down on and even imprison their opponents.

When Trump says things like, “we will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country, that lie and steal and cheat on elections,” Americans should take the threat seriously.

There is little doubt that a second term Trump would be extraordinarily dangerous to the Republic. He would give the Imperial Presidency new meaning, displaying the kind of force that the historian Arthur Schlesinger could never have imagined when he coined the term writing in 1973 in the shadow of Nixon.

It will be incumbent on Republicans running against Trump in the primaries to make certain that voters understand the risk of staying on the existing path. It will be incumbent on Biden and the Democrats to make very clear to the electorate what the stakes are in the choice that they will make in November 2024.","['seven', 'reasons', 'presidents', 'opinion', 'trump', 'second', 'power', 'president', 'threat', 'term', 'republicans', 'survived', 'dangerous', 'worry']","Why will would the second term be more dangerous than the first?

Researchers have found a tyrannosaur’s last meal perfectly preserved inside its stomach cavity.

What was on the menu 75 million years ago? The hind legs of two baby dinosaurs, according to new research on the fossil published Friday in the journal Science Advances.

Dinosaur guts and hard evidence of their diets are rarely preserved in the fossil record, and it is the first time the stomach contents of a tyrannosaur have been uncovered.

The revelation makes this discovery particularly exciting, said co-lead author Darla Zelenitsky, a paleontologist and associate professor at the University of Calgary in Alberta.

“Tyrannosaurs are these large predatory species that roamed Alberta, and North America, during the late Cretaceous. These were the iconic apex or top predators that we’ve all seen in movies, books and museums. They walked on two legs (and) had very short arms,” Zelenitsky said.

“It was a cousin of T. rex, which came later in time, 68 to 66 million years ago. T. rex is the biggest of the tyrannosaurs, Gorgosaurus was a little bit smaller, maybe full grown would have been 9, 10 meters (33 feet).”

The tyrannosaur in question, a young Gorgosaurus libratus, would have weighed about 772 pounds (350 kilograms) — less than a horse — and reached 13 feet (4 meters) in length at the time of death.

The creature was between the ages of 5 and 7 and appeared to be picky in what it consumed, Zelenitsky said.

“Its last and second-to-last meal were these little birdlike dinosaurs, Citipes, and the tyrannosaur actually only ate the hind limbs of each of these prey items. There’s really no other skeletal remains of these predators within the stomach cavity. It’s just the hind legs.

“It must have killed … both of these Citipes at different times and then ripped off the hind legs and ate those and left the rest of the carcasses,” she added. “Obviously this teenager had an appetite for drumsticks.”

The two baby dinosaurs both belonged to the species called Citipes elegans and would have been younger than 1 year old when the tyrannosaur hunted them down, the researchers determined.

The almost complete skeleton was found in Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park in 2009.

That the tyrannosaur’s stomach contents were preserved wasn’t immediately obvious, but staff at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta, noticed small protruding bones when preparing the fossil in the lab and removed a rock within its rib cage to take a closer look.

“Lo and behold, the complete hind legs of two baby dinosaurs, both under a year old, were present in its stomach,” said co-lead author François Therrien, the museum’s curator of dinosaur paleoecology, in a statement.

The paleontologists were able to determine the ages of both the predator and its prey by analyzing thin slices sampled from the fossilized bones.

“There’s growth marks like the rings of a tree. And we can essentially tell how old a dinosaur is from looking at those, the structure of the bone,” Zelenitsky said.

Changing appetites of top predators

The fossil is the first hard evidence of a long-suspected dietary pattern among large predatory dinosaurs, said paleoecologist Kat Schroeder, a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University’s department of Earth and planetary science, who wasn’t involved in the research.

The teen tyrannosaur didn’t eat what its parents did. Paleontologists believe its diet would have changed over its life span.

“Large, robust tyrannosaurs like T. rex have bite forces strong enough to hit bone when eating, and so we know they bit into megaherbivores like Triceratops,” Schroeder said via email. “Juvenile tyrannosaurs can’t bite as deep, and therefore don’t leave such feeding traces.”

She said that scientists have previously hypothesized that young tyrannosaurs had different diets from fully developed adults, but the fossil find marks the first time researchers have direct evidence.

“Combined with the relative rarity of juvenile tyrannosaur skeletons, this fossil is very significant,” Schroeder added. “Teeth can only tell us so much about the diet of extinct animals, so finding stomach contents is like picking up the proverbial ‘smoking gun.’”

The contents of the tyrannosaur’s stomach cavity revealed that at this stage in life, juveniles were hunting swift, small prey. It was likely because the predator’s body wasn’t yet well-suited for bigger prey, Zelenitsky said.

“It’s well known that tyrannosaurs changed a lot during growth, from slender forms to these robust, bone-crushing dinosaurs, and we know that this change was related to feeding behavior.”

When the dinosaur died, its mass was only 10% of that of an adult Gorgosaurus, she said.

How juvenile tyrannosaurs filled a niche

The voracious appetite of teenage tyrannosaurs and other carnivores has been thought to explain a puzzling feature of dinosaur diversity.

There are relatively few small and midsize dinosaurs in the fossil record, particularly in the Mid- to Late Cretaceous Period — something paleontologists have determined is due to the hunting activities of young tyrannosaurs.

“In Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park, where this specimen is from, we have a very well sampled formation. And so we have a pretty good idea of the ecosystem there. Over 50 species of dinosaurs,” Zelenitsky said.

“We are missing mid-sized … predators from that ecosystem.

121,Tomato lost in space by history-making astronaut has been found,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Perhaps nowhere in the universe is a fresh, ripe tomato more valuable than on the International Space Station, where astronauts live for months at a time subsisting mainly on prepackaged, shelf-stable goods.

That’s why astronaut Frank Rubio became the central figure in a lighthearted whodunnit that has taken months to solve.

After Rubio harvested one of the first tomatoes ever grown in space earlier this year, according to the astronaut, he admitted he misplaced it.

“I put it in a little bag, and one of my crewmates was doing a (public) event with some schoolkids, and I thought it’d be kind of cool to show the kids — ‘Hey guys this is the first tomato harvested in space,’” Rubio said during an October media event. “I was pretty confident that I Velcroed it where I was supposed to Velcro it … and then I came back and it was gone.”

In the microgravity environment of space, anything not anchored to a wall is at risk of floating away — destined to spend eternity hidden behind a nook or cranny within the football field-size orbiting laboratory and its labyrinthian passageways.

Rubio said he probably spent eight to 20 hours of his own free time just searching for that tomato.

“Unfortunately — because that’s just human nature — a lot of people are like, ‘He probably ate the tomato,’” Rubio said. “And I wanted to find it mostly so I could prove like I did not eat the tomato.”

But he never found it.

Rubio returned to Earth on September 27 with the precious produce still lost aboard the space station.

It remained lost — until now.

During a Wednesday news conference, members of the seven-person crew remaining on the space station revealed they had finally located the tomato.

Rubio had “been blamed for quite a while for eating the tomato,” NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli said. “But we can exonerate him.”

Tomato on top of a historic mission

The astronauts did not reveal where the tomato was or specify what state the produce was in when found.

Rubio surmised in October that it had probably already shriveled into an unrecognizable rot.

Due to the humidity at the space station, “it probably desiccated to the point where you couldn’t tell what it was,” Rubio said.

Case closed.

Rubio’s return to Earth in September was a historic moment. His stay on the space station — which lasted more than a year — set a record for the longest a US astronaut has ever spent in microgravity.

Rubio originally expected to spend only six months aboard the International Space Station. Instead, he logged 371 days following the discovery of a coolant leak coming from his original ride — a Russian Soyuz spacecraft — while it was docked to the orbiting outpost.

In his October interview, Rubio acknowledged how arduous moments of the journey were.

“I kind of allowed myself a day to feel sad and sorry for myself, and then I try to really make a conscious decision to say OK let’s have a good attitude and let’s just try to do the best job possible,” Rubio said of learning his stay would be extended by another six months.

123,"Three dead in outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, CDC warns","CNN —

An outbreak of the tickborne disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever has caused at least five illnesses, including three deaths, in the US since July, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Friday.

The five cases were identified in Southern California and involved people who had traveled to Tecate, Baja California, in the previous two weeks. Four were under age 18, and three were US residents, the agency said in a health alert. All five were hospitalized, and three died.

The CDC is warning health care providers that if a patient has symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and has recently traveled to northern Mexico, they should consider starting treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline right away, rather than waiting for test results to confirm the condition.

“RMSF is a severe, rapidly progressive, and often deadly disease transmitted by the bite of infected ticks, although many patients do not recall being bitten by a tick,” the agency notes. It’s endemic in northern Mexico and in parts of the southwestern US, where it can be transmitted by brown dog ticks. It does not spread from person to person.

Signs of infection can be mild in the first few days, including a low fever, headache, stomach problems, abdominal pain, rash and swelling around the eyes and on the back of the hands. On or after about five days, someone may develop changes in mental state, coma, brain swelling, respiratory problems and multiorgan damage. It’s fatal in 5% to 10% of cases, with about half of those deaths happening within eight days of the onset of illness.

Anyone who’s traveled to northern Mexico and develops symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever within two weeks of their return to the US should get medical attention right away, the CDC says. Protect against tick bites by treating pet dogs, using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing when outdoors. Check yourself and children for ticks after spending time outdoors or around dogs, and immediately remove any ticks you find.","['mountain', 'outbreak', 'rocky', 'cdc', 'northern', 'traveled', 'fever', 'ticks', 'mexico', 'dead', 'health', 'spotted', 'warns', 'disease']","CNN —An outbreak of the tickborne disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever has caused at least five illnesses, including three deaths, in the US since July, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Friday.

124,Prevent injuries by avoiding these common exercise errors,"Editor’s note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.

CNN —

It’s a frustrating irony that exercise — so critical to good health and longevity — also has the potential to cause harm.

Some 3.6 million people were treated in emergency departments in 2022 for various injuries involving sports and recreational equipment, according to the National Safety Council. Topping the list? Injuries from exercise and exercise equipment, which accounted for 445,642 of those emergency department visits.

Whether you’re just starting out or rebooting a fitness routine, many injuries can be prevented with a little awareness and caution, according to experts.

“One of the biggest mistakes I see is doing too much, too soon,” said Dr. Alex McDonald, a family and sports medicine physician and assistant professor of clinical science at the Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine in Pasadena, California.

McDonald said such overexercising often occurs when someone decides to begin a new exercise regimen. “But they overestimate what they can do, then get injured or quit,” he said.

Exercising should be thought of as a long game, said Lisa Herrington, a certified personal trainer in Davis, California, and cofounder of Fit House Davis. “It should not be an all-or-nothing mentality,” she said. “A little every day goes a long way.”

Be mindful of form

Using proper form when exercising is also critical, whether you’re using a piece of gym equipment or engaging in activities such as running or cycling.

“Having good form always trumps speed, weight or strength,” McDonald said. “If you have bad form, you’re not getting the full benefit of the workout, and are potentially straining other muscles and ligaments that you’re not supposed to be using.”

One common example of bad form is hanging on, or leaning over, the handrails on treadmills and elliptical machines.

“People often hang on the handrails when they’re getting tired, instead of slowing down,” Herrington said. “But handrails are supposed to help with your workout, not be a rest aid. If you’re hanging on the equipment or leaning over the bars, back off the pace or incline.”

Herrington also frequently sees people leaning too hard on bike handlebars during the spin classes she teaches, which can result in sore necks and shoulders.

“People get tired during the sprints, so all of their body weight goes into the handlebars,” she said. “They should really take a seat for a few seconds and then sprint again.”

To ensure you’re using proper form, both McDonald and Herrington said it’s best to enlist the help of a professional, such as a personal trainer or physical therapist. They are the experts, plus it’s hard to evaluate yourself.

What’s more, you carry your body differently as you age. So even if your form was great several years ago, you may need some tweaks for the body you have today.

Cycling: Proper bike setup

Cycling may seem like a straightforward exercise, but it can cause injuries, too. A frequent misstep when cycling is having an incorrect seat height.

If your bike seat is too low or high, you may develop knee or lower-back pain, as your knee angle will be altered with each pedal stroke.

Your bike seat, or saddle, should be even with your hip bone when standing next to it.

When sitting on the bike and taking your feet off the pedals, your toes should be the only thing touching the floor.

Running: Don’t overdo it

Runners are at risk of goofs such as overstriding, poor gait and overtraining.

Overstriding, a common running error, occurs when you land with your foot too far in front of your hips or knees. Doing so puts you at risk for stress- and joint-related issues. Increasing your cadence, or the frequency of your steps, lowers the high impact of running, which may reduce injuries, according to a 2021 study. Greater step frequency also combats overstriding, as you have to take shorter steps.

To see if you may have gait issues, check the bottoms of your running shoes, McDonald said. If your heels or the outsides of your shoes are quite worn, it could indicate you’re landing too forcefully and frequently in less-optimal spots.

“A lot of running stores can video you running and do a gait analysis,” he said. “Physical therapists provide this service as well. Small tweaks in your gait can make a big difference when you’re talking about preventing a repetitive injury.”

Vary your movement

Overtraining involves performing the same motions over and over again, which can fatigue the body and make it susceptible to injury. Overtraining can also cause your fitness to plateau. So no matter your favorite activity, you should routinely mix things up.

“Try new machines at the gym,” Herrington said. “Take a group exercise class. Incorporate strength training exercises into cardiovascular routines.”

Developing a strong core is essential, too. “Core exercises strengthen the front and back of your body, improve your posture and help you move better,” she said.

Build your routine gradually

No matter what workout regimen you settle on, the key to staying healthy is to start slow and low. Increase the time or intensity of your workouts by just 10% per week, McDonald said, and never boost both the intensity and duration simultaneously.

Then, enjoy.

“The goal of regular exercise is to be able to move with comfort and ease for as long as we possibly can,” Herrington said. “Doing the right exercises for your body and mind, mixing up your routine every now and then, enlisting a professional when you need guidance, and choosing exercises that bring you joy are all important pieces to living a healthy life.”

125,"Her mother vanished when she was 1. More than 40 years later, strangers, and science, have helped her understand why","CNN —

Misty LaBean spent her whole life wondering why her mother left her family when she was only a year old.

Connie Christensen’s disappearance 40 years ago from Wisconsin wasn’t out of the blue for the rest of her relatives: She had left before, running away when she was a teenager and even doing a stint at a carnival.

“After my own kids were born, I was like, how could she have left me like that?” LaBean told CNN. “I would never do that to my kids.”

Her whole life, LaBean only heard whispers about her mother. The rest of her family was hurt and reluctant even to talk about Christensen, believing she’d chosen to walk away at just 20 years old.

All that time, though, there was something else LaBean didn’t know: Strangers hundreds of miles away were hunting answers to the very same mystery.

Their key to unlocking it – with her help – would be time, along with the inexorable advance of science. Eventually, those seeking the truth would connect. And a grown daughter would understand why her mom’s leaving “may not have been her choice.”

Hunters in the woods – and in the lab

It was a sketch artist who first used a clay bust to try to recreate the face of the remains found in December 1982 in east-central Indiana, said the chief deputy coroner of Wayne County Coroner’s Office, Lauren Ogden.

Hunters had found them near Martindale Creek in a rural area mainly used for hunting and farming, she said. But due to flooding, the remains were damaged beyond recognition, and they ended up at the University of Indianapolis for storage.

But the coroner’s office never stopped trying to figure out their identity.

And over those years, science was improving. Within two generations, investigators had vaulted from relying on drawings to try to identify the missing and the slain to mining the evidence itself for tiny, delicate strands that could pinpoint exactly who somebody was.

The technology had gotten so good, in fact, that in 2021, the Wayne County Coroner’s Office went back to the evidence found near Martindale Creek to see if it could extract any DNA to figure out who the remains belonged to, Ogden told CNN.

The first attempt failed: There wasn’t enough genetic material to generate a usable DNA profile, she said.

They tried a second DNA extraction.

Another failure.

Then, she explained, Ogden and her team tried a DNA extraction from a bone in the foot.

A critical link, waiting to be found

Around that same time, someone in Christensen’s family had taken up an interest in genealogy and was encouraging her relatives to submit DNA records to public sources that help people build out family trees, Ogden said.

Lauded as a way to explore personal history and connect with previously unknown kin, DNA matching also has been used to link victims to criminals such as the Happy Face Killer, who murdered at least eight women. It helped lead police to the Golden State Killer, suspected of a dozen homicides and over 50 rapes.

Authorities in the Golden State case used the free genealogy and DNA database GEDmatch to link crime-scene DNA with a pool of possible suspects created using DNA profiles or genealogical data from public services like Ancestry – the kind Christensen’s relative had encouraged her family to use.

GEDmatch is also used by the DNA Doe Project, a non-profit that uses investigative genetic genealogy to identify anonymous remains.

Working with that group – and DNA from the foot bone of the Martindale Creek remains – the Wayne County Coroner’s Office tried to craft a potential family tree for the person the hunters found back in 1982, Ogden said.

Within 24 hours, they had a strong lead, the DNA Doe Project’s Lori Flowers told CNN.

The non-profit had narrowed GEDmatch’s pool of possible DNA links to the Martindale Creek remains to the Christensen siblings, she said. Then, combing through family social media posts and relatives’ obituaries, investigators noticed something: Connie Christensen had disappeared from her family’s public record.

But they still had to confirm it.

Ogden reached out to the missing woman’s child, LaBean.

“Being on the ground floor,” Ogden recalled, “I was the one that called her daughter and said, ‘I’m a complete stranger, can I come … swab your cheek?’”

Reclaiming her own mother’s identity

The match was her mother.

Beyond Christensen’s identity, the coroner’s office also shared a discovery its team had made about how LaBean’s mother had died, Ogden said: a gunshot wound.

The grim detail let loose a tangle of new questions: What was Christensen doing in Indiana? Who killed her? And why?

LaBean went to the spot near Martindale Creek where her mother’s remains had been found, she said, and wondered how the killer had gotten Christensen so far away from the nearest bus line.

“In some ways, it makes me feel a little bit better,” LaBean said of learning the real story of her mom’s absence. “But it also makes me angry because I could have had the chance to know her, and somebody took that chance away from me.”

Maybe publicity about the case will help her family find more answers, LaBean said.

Even without that, though, knowing what happened to Christensen released the throttle her family had held so tightly on her memory – a gift to the child who’d wondered for so long why she’d been abandoned.

“The biggest thing is I’ve always loved animals,” LaBean said. “And then I found out that she really liked cats. That’s kind of something I got from her.”

LaBean also reclaimed the opal ring her mother was wearing when she died, a nod to her own childhood, when some of the first jewelry pieces she held dear were opals, she said. The gold band with two diamonds and an opal hangs on a chain around the neck of the grown daughter – now a mother herself.

“It’s really come full circle,” Ogden said. “She’s wearing the ring that was found there 40 years ago, and it’s mind-blowing to think that your DNA is able to provide that closure.”

Meanwhile, Christensen’s remains were laid to rest in April among her relatives, including her parents, her obituary read. “We were able to get her family back to the site where her mom was found so they could leave flowers and have some quiet moments out there,” Ogden said.

Some yearnings will remain unrequited, like how LaBean wished her mom could have done her hair before her first middle school dance the way she was said to have done her own sisters’, she told CNN.

Still, the grown daughter – with her whole family – is now eager to bring the lost, young mother back into an embrace multiplied over decades as they finally grieve all they truly lost.

“If Connie would still be here with us, she would have been surrounded by all of her nieces, nephews, great nieces and nephews, aunts, uncles, and many cousins from both sides of the family,” her obituary read. “Connie would have been an amazing mother to her only daughter, Misty, and her husband, Dan LaBean. She never had the chance to be a great and loving grandmother.”

127,Six French teenagers convicted in connection with 2020 beheading of teacher Paty,"CNN —

A French court on Friday convicted six teenagers in connection with the 2020 beheading of history teacher Samuel Paty, whose murder shocked the country.

The teacher had shown his pupils caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression, angering some Muslim parents. Most Muslims avoid depictions of prophets, considering them to be blasphemous.

Among those on trial was a teenage girl who had allegedly told her parents that Paty had asked Muslim pupils to leave the room before showing the caricatures.

The court found her guilty of having made false accusation charges and slanderous comments, as it was established that she was not in the class at the time.

The other adolescents were found guilty of charges related to taking part in a pre-meditated criminal conspiracy and helping to prepare an ambush.

Paty, 47, was killed outside his school in a Paris suburb by an 18-year-old assailant of Chechen origin, who was shot dead by police soon after the attack.

The court found those adolescents guilty of having pointed out Paty to the murderer.

Louis Cailliez, lawyer for Paty’s sister Mickaelle, told reporters his client was “satisfied with the full conviction,” but less so with the sentences, that she found “too lenient”.

Dylan Slama, a lawyer for one of the teenagers, said that though it was hard to talk about satisfaction in such tragic circumstances, there was a sense of relief for his client.

The heaviest sentence was given to an adolescent who was formally given a 6-month prison sentence, although he should be able to serve this at home while under electronic surveillance.

The girl who was found guilty of making false accusations and slanderous comments was given an 18-month suspended sentence and put on probation measures for two years.

All six teenagers’ suspended sentences are tied to them following a strict set of probation measures for two to three years.

128,Rhode Island man charged with making false bomb threat on airplane,"CNN —

A Rhode Island man faces federal charges for allegedly making threats that forced a Florida flight bound for Providence to make an emergency landing, according to federal prosecutors in Florida.

Evan Sims, 41, was charged with “false information and threats regarding the possession of an explosive on an airplane” after his alleged threats caused the flight to divert to Jacksonville, Florida, the Middle District of Florida US Attorney’s Office said in a news release.

On December 5, Sims was traveling on Breeze Airways flight 717 from Orlando, Florida, when he began arguing with the woman he was traveling with before takeoff, a criminal complaint filed Wednesday by the office says.

“Sims told his travel companion that he had never heard of the airline for the flight and that he hoped the airplane did not ‘go down.’ Sims stated that they would be ‘gone with the wind,’” according to the news release.

The complaint says Sims’ travel companion told him “several times that their relationship was over” and to leave her alone.

Sims made comments to the woman about needing to use the plane’s emergency doors and how the windows “looked like they had not been used,” the complaint states, adding he also allegedly told her he hoped they would not have to use the windows.

He questioned the flight crew about the emergency life raft stored in an overhead compartment, authorities say.

“Sims’s travel companion and the surrounding passengers were uncomfortable with Sims’s statements and Sims’s travel companion asked Sims to stop making his comments,” according to the news release.

Sims partially stood in his seat as the plane ascended, exclaiming that he wanted to get off the flight. He said “approximately two times” his travel partner had a bomb on the plane, according to the complaint.

The flight was then diverted to Jacksonville International Airport, and a search by bomb-detection dogs did not find a bomb, authorities said.

A video taken from inside the plane showed a man and a woman being removed from the plane in handcuffs after the incident, CNN affiliate WFOX/WJAX reported.

Sims and his travel companion were detained at the airport while law enforcement conducted an investigation, according to the complaint.

“Safety is our top priority and we take threats of any kind very seriously,” Breeze Airways spokesperson Gareth Edmondson-Jones told CNN in a statement.

The TSA, the Jacksonville Aviation Authority Airport Police Department and the FBI investigated the case.

129,"University of Nevada, Las Vegas, shooting: Details emerge about gunman whose motive is still unknown","CNN —

The 67-year-old career college professor who fatally shot three faculty members this week at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, kept a “target list” of faculty at the school and elsewhere, said authorities searching for a motive.

Investigators found ammunition at Anthony Polito’s apartment, along with an eviction notice, and have identified nearly two dozen letters he mailed in the hours leading up to the shooting to university personnel across the country, they said. He also was fascinated by conspiracy theories and Las Vegas, according to his online writings and former students.

Polito was shot and killed by police Wednesday after his attack near the site of the deadliest mass shooting in US history, when a sniper in 2017 killed more than 50 people and injured hundreds at an outdoor concert on the Las Vegas Strip. Wednesday’s violence marked the 80th school shooting in the US this year, including 29 at university or college campuses, a CNN analysis shows.

Polito, armed with a 9 mm pistol and nine loaded magazines, also injured a visiting male professor in a building that is part of the business school. That man was being treated for life-threatening injuries, Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill said Thursday.

None of the faculty members shot Wednesday were on Polito’s “target list,” which included “people he was seeking on the university campus as well as faculty from the Eastern Carolina University,” McMahill said. The sheriff did not explain what led investigators to believe it was a list of targets or where they found the document.

It remained unclear why Polito, who lived in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, targeted UNLV or if he had any connection to the school. He had unsuccessfully applied to several higher education jobs in Nevada and appeared to be struggling financially, McMahill said.

An eviction notice was found on the door of Polito’s Henderson apartment, the sheriff said. And in the hours leading up to the shooting, Polito had mailed 22 letters to university personnel across the country with no return address, he said. At least some of the envelopes had a harmless white powder in them, Las Vegas police said Thursday evening more details about the letters’ contents weren’t immediately released.

Detectives are asking people in academia who get a letter with no return address to “proceed with caution,” McMahill said.

UNLV mourns beloved faculty

The shooting, just days before the start of final exams, was “the most difficult day in the history of our university,” UNLV president Keith Whitfield said.

Killed were business school professors Patricia Navarro-Velez and Cha-Jan “Jerry” Chang, Whitfield said Thursday in a letter to the school community.

On Friday, the county coroner identified the third victim as associate professor Naoko Takemaru.

Cha-Jan ""Jerry"" Chang UNLV.edu

“I won’t sugarcoat it. We are all hurting right now,” Whitfield said. “But it’s in these trying times that we need to lean on one another for support.

“Words are still hard to come by as we’re only beginning to process the grief, loss, anger, and fear associated with Wednesday’s tragic campus shooting that took the lives of three of our cherished faculty members,” Whitfield wrote.

Navarro-Velez, 39, an assistant professor of accounting, had been teaching at the school for almost five years and had “devoted her career to educating the next generation of accountants,” Whitfield said.

Chang, 64, had been teaching UNLV’s business school students for more than 20 years on “management information systems,” Whitfield said.

Takemaru taught Japanese studies, according to her faculty page on UNLV’s website.

While she faced multiple challenges and physical disabilities, Takemaru was described by her colleague, associate professor Margaret Harp, as a “triple-threat artist.” She was a professional concert pianist, embroidered and enjoyed making homemade chocolates, Harp said during a news conference Friday.

Takemaru was also a cat lover who covered her office in photos, drawings and calendars of cats.

“Naoko was frail physically, however, she was lionhearted in kindness, lionhearted in generosity, lionhearted in humanity, the point of liberal arts, and I have no doubt she was lionhearted in her final moments on earth,” Harp said.

UNLV will forego in-person finals in the wake of the fatal shooting but will hold winter commencement as planned.

“Given the physical and emotional trauma that the university community has endured, and because of the impact to campus facilities, we have decided that faculty and staff should continue to work remotely through the end of the calendar year,” university President Keith Whitfield said in a post.

Whitfield said the university will “provide flexibility for faculty and instructors – as well as students – to bring this semester to a positive end” by ending the semester with the grades earned through work completed before the shooting. Some professors may elect to hold optional online finals or arrange for take-home projects.

Winter commencement will proceed in person as planned on December 19 for undergraduates and December 20 for those receiving master’s and doctoral degrees.

The gunman: Ammunition and conspiracies

Investigators found several computers and hard drive components while searching Polito’s apartment and are reviewing the devices and Polito’s social media for a possible motive, the sheriff said.

Authorities also found ammunition like cartridges found at the scene of the shooting, as well as a box matching the gun police believe Polito used, McMahill said. On a chair, investigators also discovered a document similar to a “last will and testament,” he said.

Polito’s online writings show interest in the gambling capital and in conspiracy theories. His personal website lists a section devoted to “Powerful Organizations Bent on Global Domination!” and includes links to common conspiracy theory fodder like Freemasonry, the Trilateral Commission and “The Rothchild (sic) Family.” Billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros, a common target for antisemitic conspiracy theories, is listed as one of the “Great Minds of the Twentieth Century,” alongside Albert Einstein.

Meanwhile, three of Polito’s former students say he spoke frequently about Las Vegas and visited the city as much as he could while teaching in other states. His website notes he had made “more than two dozen trips to Vegas over the last fifteen years,” although it was not clear when the statement was posted.

Polito had an unorthodox teaching style and often opened classes with Las Vegas stories, said Jonathan Peralta, who was in one of Polito’s classes at Eastern Carolina University in 2013 or 2014.

“This was surprising,” Peralta told CNN of the UNLV shooting. “The Vegas connection is what makes it so crazy because he would talk about Vegas so much.”

Polito worked at Eastern Carolina University’s college of business from 2001 until he resigned in 2017, when he was a tenured associate professor, a college spokesperson told CNN. He had ties to Nevada’s Roseman University from October 2018 to June 2022, attending the school and working as an adjunct professor, a school spokesperson said. He also had worked in academia in Georgia, his now-removed LinkedIn page showed.

How the shooting unfolded

Polito got to the university just before 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, just minutes before the shooting erupted in Beam Hall as professors were preparing their classes for upcoming tests and students outdoors were enjoying games, food and other activities.

Police began getting 911 calls around 11:45 a.m., prompting officers to rush to the campus, McMahill said.

About three dozen 911 calls were released from the shooting, most from those in the Lee Business School where the shooting took place. Others were placed by people fleeing the scene as well as distraught family members relaying information sent via text by loved ones at the scene. Many callers reported hearing “a lot of shots,” and then “screaming.”

The calls included one from a woman who was crying and hiding under the desk in her office as she described hearing gunshots followed by screaming.

Officers entered Beam Hall – which lacks interior cameras, the sheriff said – with the first officer arriving within 78 seconds of the first 911 call, said Adam Garcia of University Police Services.

Polito made his way through multiple floors of the building, where Navarro-Velez worked on the fourth floor and Chang on the third floor, the sheriff said.

The gunman left the building around 11:55 a.m., he said.

University police outdoors confronted Polito, who was shot repeatedly and collapsed, was arrested and died there, McMahill said.

“Officers then assembled action teams and began a systematic search for additional suspects and victims,” he said. “Those teams went through multiple buildings and multiple floors. Many times we had to force entry into rooms where students and faculty were sheltering in place.”

Officers who shot suspect identified, hailed as heroes

The two University Police Services officers who engaged in gunfire with the suspect were hailed as heroes by Chief Adam Garcia during a news conference Friday.

They were identified as Detective Nathanial Drum and Officer Damian Garcia, Chief Garcia said.

Drum has worked for the department since 2017 and is assigned to the detective bureau, while Garcia has worked for the agency since 2018 and is assigned to the special events division as well as the detective bureau, the chief added.

“In a word, these two officers are heroes. They kept the worst from becoming a bloodbath,” Garcia said. “The collective response in actions of our other initial responding officers, UPD, Metro or many regional agencies no doubt saved lives as well. Their swift response and exceptional courage were pivotal in neutralizing this threat and undoubtedly prevented further harm for our community.”

The two men have been put on administrative leave pending an investigation, as is standard procedure during officer-involved shootings, Garcia said.

130,"Florida woman charged with plotting former son-in-law’s death alleges ‘inhumane treatment’ in jail, attorneys say","CNN —

Lawyers for Donna Adelson, a Florida woman charged with murder and other offenses in the 2014 fatal shooting of her former son-in-law, allege she has been subjected to “cruel and unusual punishment.”

Adelson’s attorney, Marissel Descalzo, filed an emergency motion Tuesday with multiple allegations, including accusations jail staff are forcing the 73-year-old to sit naked and eat with her hands while in a small cell by herself.

The jail staff is also accused of withholding medication from Adelson and making her go days without a shower.

The motion argued the alleged treatment is a violation of Adelson’s Sixth Amendment rights because she has been unable to communicate with her attorney or help with her defense.

Descalzo requests the court release Adelson on house arrest or force the jail to improve her conditions, release her from isolation and “place Donna in a unit where she can prepare for trial and speak to her family.” It also requests an additional alternative, asking the court to consider issuing Adelson a “psychological evaluation” to place her in a different unit.

A spokesperson for the Leon County Sheriff’s Office told the Tallahassee Democrat the Leon County Detention Facility takes the care, custody and control of everyone in its facility very seriously.

Descalzo told CNN a hearing on the allegations is scheduled for Monday.

Adelson was arrested November 13 as she and her husband tried to board a flight out of Miami International Airport to Vietnam. She was held at a Miami jail before she was transported to Leon County.

Adelson is charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy and solicitation in what prosecutors allege was a murder-for-hire killing of Florida State University law professor Dan Markel, her former son-in-law.

Her son, Charles Adelson, a South Florida dentist, was convicted of Markel’s murder a week before her arrest.

In the motion, Descalzo said the evidence against her client is “circumstantial at best.” Adding “there is a presumption of innocence in this country.

131,Former police chief sentenced to 11 years for involvement in January 6 Capitol attack,"CNN —

A former California police chief who brought a hatchet to the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and gave prior speeches calling for the execution of his perceived political enemies, was sentenced to 11 years in prison Thursday.

Alan Hostetter, 59, was sentenced to 135 months – a little over 11 years – Thursday by US District Judge Royce C. Lamberth, for his involvement in the Capitol riot.

In July, Hostetter was found guilty of conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon.

Prior to the Capitol riots, the retired La Habra police chief spread several conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election, according to a release from the Justice Department.

Hostetter co-sponsored a pro-Trump rally a day before the Capitol riot spewing violent rhetoric in speeches in DC on January 5. The next day, Hostetter brought tactical gear, a helmet, hatches, knives, stun batons, pepper spray and other gear to the Capitol, according to the Department of Justice.

Upon arrival, he met up with other members of a group known as the “DC Brigade,” before joining the “Stop the Steal” rally. He later made his way to the Capitol building, where he joined other rioters pushing through law enforcement.

Hostetter was arrested on June 10, 2021, in California by the FBI.

Four of his co-defendants were convicted in November of conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding and a fifth co-defendant, Russell Taylor, previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding, according to the release.

132,"Could the most magical time of year be so full of loneliness, anger and stress?","Editor’s note: Dr. Neha Chaudhary is a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and chief medical officer at Modern Health.

CNN —

As the holiday season approaches, many conjure up images of the perfect gathering: comforting aromas of home-cooked feasts, harmonious laughter between friends and family, and thoughts of gratitude that easily roll off the tongue.

But for some people, this time of year feels like the exact opposite. It’s a time of stress, emotional turmoil or intense loneliness that looks nothing like the traditional celebration of togetherness.

Sixty-six percent of people report feeling lonely at the holidays, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, while 64% of people with mental illness say that the holidays make their condition worse. And as a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist, I see these issues firsthand all too often.

Why are loneliness and emotional distress so common this time of year? Some people may be living far from family or may not be able to afford to travel to see them. Others may be grieving the loss of loved ones or navigating strained relationships — and the holidays can serve as a rude reminder of those losses. And for some, the holiday season brings families together who would rather be apart. Whatever the cause, the impact of the holidays on our mental health can be profound.

If this sounds like you, you’re clearly not alone. And if your experience at this time of year is the exact opposite, remember that your friends, colleagues or strangers may be having a hard time at the holidays.

Understanding and navigating loneliness

While the holiday season is portrayed as a time for family and social gatherings, that expectation can inadvertently amplify feelings of isolation. That’s true not only for those who find themselves alone, but also for those who are surrounded by loved ones.

The problem is loneliness is killing us — literally. According to the US surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, loneliness is as bad for your health as is smoking every day. It can increase your risk of mental health conditions, stroke, heart disease and even premature death.

Fortunately, there are ways to tackle the feeling. If you’ve been feeling lonely this holiday season, the first thing you can do is recognize and name it. Let the feeling roll in as if it’s a fleeting moment that will pass. If you try to resist a feeling, usually it will push back, staying longer than its welcome. If you allow the feeling to float on through you, it can float away just as easily as it came.

Next, see if you can pinpoint the source of the feeling. Do the holidays remind you of the loss of a loved one, or are they connected to a negative experience from your childhood? Or is it that you find yourself comparing yourself with others, only to feel like you aren’t measuring up to your own expectations, set by social comparison?

Once you identify the trigger for the emotion, you can try to talk to yourself about it with compassion as if you would talk to a friend. Remind yourself that it’s OK to grieve. Tell yourself that comparison is a distraction and put aside your social media. Or remind yourself that you can make investments in relationships if you really want to — you do have some control.

Lastly, find ways for connection with others in the moment. Is there a friend you haven’t texted in a while? A group activity you could join that leaves you with a sense of community? If you don’t have existing connections to turn to, having a brief interaction with a stranger can work as well. Chat with someone outside of your home or better yet offer to help or give something to a stranger. The sense of connection it can foster may surprise you. And it’s good for your health.

Gratitude, reflection and … anger?

While the focus of this time of year tends to be around reflection and gratitude, for some people it brings on a completely different feeling: anger. Anger toward family members who, when brought together, bring unresolved tensions up to the surface as a group. Anger toward loved ones who bailed on them many years ago. Or anger about life not going according to plan.

Sound like you? If so, put aside your self-judgment and let yourself feel. And then do something about it. What are ways you can share your anger that are respectful and constructive? Is there a conversation you can have with a loved one to work through hurt feelings from the past? If that doesn’t feel doable, consider writing your feelings down in a letter that you may never give the other person. Sometimes the act of getting it out of your brain and down on paper can feel like a welcome release. You can tear up the letter and throw it in the trash or flush it down the toilet, picturing the anger leaving you as you destroy the letter itself.

Handling the stress and pressure

Navigating the expectations and pressures set by society (and yourself) around the holidays can be similar to walking a tightrope. Whether it’s the expertly roasted turkey or picture-perfect family gatherings, idealized holiday movie and social media images can create a sense of pressure that might overshadow the essence of gratitude and togetherness. Ultimately, these unrealistic standards often lead to unnecessary stress and a sense of inadequacy for many people.

To break yourself out of the trap of comparison and never-ending expectations, start by acknowledging that perfection is an elusive goal and not the point of the holidays. Embrace imperfections. Try out new rituals and routines that are relaxed, goofy and inconsistent year to year, just for the sake of having fun.

Set boundaries with family and friends who have high expectations of you, whether it’s your aunt’s commentary on what you should wear to dinner, your mother’s criticism of your cooking, or your father-in-law’s comments about how you should be spending more time with that side of the family than you are. Practice in advance what you’re going to say to people when they push your boundaries.

The holiday blues

This holiday season is going to be hard for a lot of people, for a lot of different reasons. If uncomfortable feelings arise for you this holiday, I encourage you to hold space for them.

If you’re feeling low, give yourself a pass and turn your focus to ways you can take care of yourself and your mental health, whether it’s curling up under a blanket and binge-watching movies, writing in a journal, listening to music, expressing yourself through art or calling an old friend. Recognize what you need to survive this moment. And if nothing else is working, turn to a professional for help.

For many people, it will be the most wonderful time of the year. For others, it won’t. The more we encourage a culture of empathy and understanding around all the emotions that come with the holidays, the more we can strengthen our communities and lift each other up when it matters. And this might be one of the times of year that it matters most.

133,Why France’s Cote d’Azur is one of the world’s best coastlines,"CNN —

It’s a place that oozes sophistication, bonne humeur and joie de vivre, conjuring up an air of elegance unlike anywhere else on Earth. This is the Côte d’Azur, the grand dame destination for European vacations.

Stretching from Cassis to Menton in the far southeast of France, this spectacular coastline is home to the iconic resorts of Antibes, Cannes and St Tropez. And that’s before we get to the glamorous gem that is Nice, the independent principality of Monaco and the beautiful countryside of Provence.

The area earned its reputation as a tourist hotspot during the 19th century, when English and European aristocracy decamped here during the summer for guaranteed good weather and ready access to first-class culture.

Today, it continues to be the ultimate place for the wealthy to kick back. Offering first-class sailing, villas and hotels with a rarified air and opportunities to drive vintage sports cars along its classic Mediterranean coastal roads, it’s no wonder the Côte d’Azur retains its allure all these years on. At its heart there is a simplicity, beauty and old-school charm that is unbeatable.

‘We just use what we have’

Nothing quite sums up the simplicity of the region like its food. This is somewhere that lets the freshest of ingredients do the work, especially in Nice. And few people understand more about the wonder of Niçoise cuisine than Vanessa Massé.

Massé owns Pure & V, a Michelin-starred restaurant that likes to keep things simple. Every morning, she heads to the market, so she can touch, feel and choose the best vegetables for her dishes.

“I love this place,” she says. “I feel… very happy to wake up along the sea and it’s… my time to breathe before a busy day. For me, it’s not working. I (go to the) market every morning.”

Her passion for food is clear as she strolls through the stalls under the warm Mediterranean sun, picking out what she needs for the day ahead.

“There is no blah blah, no we just use what we have,” she says of the way they cook in this part of France. “Cuisine Niçoise they will use of course local ingredients… for me a lot of finger food, a lot of very easy things, a lot of flavors.”

That’s evident in the beautiful food her chefs create, from delicious Soupe au Pistou, made with green vegetables, beans, pasta and potatoes and Le Fleur de Courgette, a simple stuffed courgette flower that is a staple around these parts. Add fresh anchovies straight from the sea and you have a meal that showcases why so many adore Nice’s humble food.

‘You can feel the light’

As if the superb food, gorgeous weather and seaside resorts tumbling down the cliffs towards the shores of the Mediterranean weren’t enough, there is another core aspect to the Côte d’Azur: light.

Bathing the coastline and farmland of Provence, this glorious feature meant that the area became the ultimate destination for artists looking to escape the confines of Paris in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. And no one artist is as synonymous with the Côte d’Azur as Henri Matisse.

“He came here in 1917 at the age of 48. So quite late you would say in his life, but just fell in love with the region and decided to spend the rest of his life here,” explains art enthusiast Florence Tournier, walking through the galleries of Nice’s Matisse Museum.

Although packed with Matisse’s finest works, which are infused with that Niçoise sunlight, there is one painting at the museum that truly stands out. “Tempête à Nice,” the storm of Nice, was painted on Matisse’s first visit.

“It was ruined by constant rain for an entire month,” says Tournier of Matisse’s initial sojourn south. “I think he was very angry and he almost decided to leave and never come back. But the next morning the mistral wind blew the clouds away and this amazing light came to the sea and sky and he decided to stay for the rest of his life.”

The view, painted from the Palais de la Mediterranee, which was a hotel at the time, can still be enjoyed today, something which makes the Côte d’Azur particularly alluring for art enthusiasts. It doesn’t take much sleuthing to find the classic views that have been painted all across the region.

And it’s not just the work of Matisse which helped highlight the true beauty of the region. He was joined by his great friend Picasso, with Renoir, Monet and Chagall all heading here to bring the light to life on canvas.

“Throughout the whole Côte d’Azur you can identify spots that have inspired artists and that were used as decor and model for the landscape of different paintings,” says Tournier.

In fact, there is an oft-overlooked but very beautiful artist’s trail visitors can follow to see these inspirations for themselves. It takes in Antibes, Aix-en-Provence, and, a short drive northwest of Nice, Saint Paul de Vence.

It was here that Chagall did much of his work and you can look across the valley and see exactly what he painted, still the same a century on.

As Tournier says, “You can feel the light, you can feel the colors, you can be in the footsteps of these artists.”

It’s a simple pleasure of the French Riviera that brings true joy.

Purple fields

While the light of the Côte d’Azur provided artists with a reason to flock here 100 years ago, today another simple part of everyday life is also drawing in visitors in their droves: Lavender. The vast swaying fields of purple, found across Provence, are the stuff of which Instagram dreams are made.

And while some might balk at this influx, lavender farmer Jean-Pierre Jaubert is happy to see tourists tramping through his fields. He says it’s great for business.

Lavender is as much a part of the identity of the South of France as the sun and the beach. The flower has grown wild here for hundreds of years.

Speaking in his native French, Jaubert explains that his family has been working these fields for 300 years.

“I think it’s in my veins… What’s more beautiful than this?” he says, gesturing to the fields and breathing in the scent. “The sound of the bees and the smell.”

Provence is a circular story, says Faubert, where the light that drew in the artists helps to fuel the growth of the lavender, bringing more visitors who want to get closer to nature.

Faubert’s farm shop does brisk business, selling all things lavender, from bunches of dried flowers to lavender essence. And it’s also one of the raw ingredients for another quintessentially Côte d’Azur product: Perfume.

The perfect scent

An hour from Nice, the town of Grasse is the perfume capital of the world. Besides lavender, flowers grow everywhere here. And at Fragonard perfumery, which first opened in 1926, they really know how to create the perfect scent.

Karina Hidalgo, who works at Fragonard, says that being able to choose your favorite perfume isn’t as easy as you think.

“When you go to perfumery shops, you would like to try every single bottle,” she says. “After three, your nose doesn’t smell.”

There is, however, a way around this particular issue.

“You smell your clothes, your skin, your hair. Every time you cannot smell (a new scent) your nose needs to smell something that it already knows in order to be able to continue smelling,” says Hidalgo, smiling.

At Fragonard, they can also help you create your own personalized scent, something to remember the Côte d’Azur by. Jessica Buchanan is an expert, known here as a nose, in creating perfumes.

135,"‘It’s lending on steroids’: How Buy Now, Pay Later companies are meeting an influx of demand despite higher costs","New York CNN —

In good economic times and bad, people’s self-control to spend within their means on gifts during the holiday season flies out the window. For decades, credit cards bore the brunt of compulsive holiday spending habits. But increasingly, they’re sharing the spotlight with Buy Now, Pay Later companies.

On Cyber Monday, BNPL purchases hit an all-time high, up 43% from a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics. The number of items per order also rose 11% annually as shoppers used BNPL for larger purchases.

Like credit cards, these companies allow customers to make purchases even if they don’t have the money on hand to pay for the goods or services at the point of sale. Instead, users can pay in interest-free installments over a typical period of six weeks. Unless they make a late payment there are usually no fees. Alternatively, they can elect to make payments over a longer timeframe but they could be subject to an annual percentage interest rate as high as 36%.

Before the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in March 2022, BNPL companies such as Affirm, Klarna, Afterpay, Zip and Sezzle were able to get funds to lend out to customers at a relatively low cost.

That meant they could lend liberally to customers, many of whom don’t have a long credit history or don’t have a high enough credit score to qualify for traditional credit offerings. And, unlike credit card companies, BNPL companies usually don’t run traditional credit checks on customers. In addition, they are not required to report missed or late payments to credit bureaus.

But as the Fed continued to raise rates to fight inflation, BNPL companies have had to pay a lot more for the money they loan out. For instance, one such lender, Affirm, noted in its latest earnings report that its funding costs increased by 195% for the three months ended in September compared to the same period in 2022.

But that doesn’t mean Affirm and other BNPL companies have made fewer loans. “It’s lending on steroids,” said Marshall Lux, a senior research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.

A numbers game

“New users are the highest-risk loans we will write,” Affirm CEO and founder Max Levchin said on the company’s quarterly earnings call last month. “When you have never transacted with Affirm before, by definition we don’t know you as well as we do someone who has transacted already.” That’s why Levchin said the company is “deliberately careful with approving new consumers.”

That’s become even more critical with interest rates at the highest level in over two decades. As Affirm noted in its earnings report, consumers are also adversely affected by higher interest rates because it leads to heftier financial commitments outside of BNPL. For companies like Affirm, this raises the possibility that customers won’t make payments on time — or even worse, at all.

Even though the majority of its customers make payments on time, Affirm has seen a slight uptick in the share of transactions that aren’t being paid on time. For instance, in the quarter that ended in September, 5.15% of loans were more than four days past due, compared to 4.1% from the prior quarter.

So, companies are focused on forging relationships with good customers to get them to be repeat users. The more transactions they make, the more data BNPL companies have to determine how much they can afford to lend to them and at what rate. As the companies have grown, their models for underwriting the loans, which occur on a transaction-by-transaction basis, have become more sophisticated.

“The more you know about your customers, the more safely you can lend,” said Jaime Toplin, a senior financial services analyst at Morning Consult.

Affirm, for instance, saw a 42% increase in the share of transactions coming from repeat users over the past year, according to its earnings report.

Afterpay, another BNPL provider, launched a rewards program two years ago that gives users points if they make on-time payments for at least four orders of $40 or more every six months. But it’s unclear if this strategy is paying off for Afterpay, since it doesn’t publicly disclose the share of transactions generated by repeat customers.

Even if companies are getting better at growing their share of repeat customers, it’s not stopping shoppers from turning to multiple BNPL providers. That’s problematic for the companies because they don’t know what a customer’s total BNPL debt obligations are, said Lux, who worked as a chief risk officer for Chase at the height of the Great Recession. In his view, this is leading people to take on more debt than they can afford.

Shifting away from zero-interest loans

As interest rates have gone up, BNPL companies aren’t making as many interest-free loans, absent any other changes to the terms they set with individuals and merchants.

For Affirm, 74% of its gross merchandise volume was from interest-bearing loans last quarter, compared to 64% a year ago. Affirm’s chief financial officer Michael Linford said in a November shareholder letter that these loans enable the company to “responsibly extend access to credit to more consumers.”

“Rising interest rates have an impact but do not flow through on a one-to-one basis,” Matt Gross, a spokesperson for Affirm, told CNN. “As rates go up, our solutions are even more valuable to consumers and merchants,” he said.

Reworking terms with retailers

There are two major sources of income for BNPL companies — the interest users pay to take on longer-term payment plans and the fees they collect from retailers.

With regard to the latter, it works like this: If an item costs $100, a BNPL company might offer a retailer $95 instead of the full amount the customer has to eventually pay for. Retailers are willing to do that because they otherwise wouldn’t be able to get any money from someone who doesn’t have the funds readily available and lacks access to other forms of credit, said Michael Taiano, a vice president at Moody’s Investors Service who covers US-based lenders.

That also leads to higher average order sizes, since BNPL users “can spend more than they would otherwise because they’re able to spread out the payments,” he added.

“We don’t know to what extent [BNPL companies] are renegotiating pricing with those individual merchants as interest rates have gone up,” since they don’t publicly disclose this, Taiano told CNN. But he believes there’s a high likelihood it’s happening.","['despite', 'later', 'lending', 'affirm', 'rates', 'credit', 'meeting', 'steroids', 'influx', 'customers', 'dont', 'loans', 'companies', 'higher', 'users', 'bnpl', 'demand', 'costs', 'pay', 'interest']","And, unlike credit card companies, BNPL companies usually don’t run traditional credit checks on customers.

136,Tesla failed at battery swapping but Stellantis says it may have the secret,"CNN —

It can take 20 minutes to “fast charge” an electric car up to 80%. But what if you could just change the batteries like they were AAs in a toy, and be back on the road fully charged in a handful of minutes?

It seems like an obvious solution, but there have been some famous failures with battery swapping. A decade ago, Tesla announced it would build out a network of battery swapping stations that could change out Model S’s battery pack in 90 seconds. But like many of CEO Elon Musk’s publicly-announced ideas, it was later dropped with Musk claiming customers weren’t interested.

And in 2013, an Israeli company that promised battery swapping called Better Place went out of business after burning through $850 million in cash and deploying only about 1,000 cars, according to reports at the time.

But the idea has become a reality, again, at least in Asia. Chinese EV maker Nio has been offering battery swapping for its vehicles since 2019. Nio now claims to be the world’s largest operator of battery swapping technology having performed over 32 million battery swaps since then at more than 2,100 stations.

Now Stellantis, the global automaker that makes Jeep, Dodge and Fiat vehicles, is also trying out the idea on a small scale – with a crucial difference – in hopes of incorporating it in future EV models.

Stellantis is working with a company called Ample that has created a new battery swapping system it says can work in virtually any shape or size of vehicle. It says the system doesn’t require any automaker to alter its vehicle to fit a special battery pack.

With Ample’s system, the entire battery pack – which can weigh more than 1,000 pounds – doesn’t get replaced as a single unit. Instead, a number of individually sealed battery modules about the size of a desktop computer are taken out by automated machinery and replaced one by one. In this way, all the vehicle’s batteries can be quickly replaced in easily manageable chunks rather than in a single huge slab.

That means it might take five to, at most, 10 minutes to change batteries, depending on the size of the vehicle and how many modules there are, instead of the 90 seconds Musk had promised. But having separate small battery packs provides numerous advantages.

First, the equipment required to change the batteries can be small. Ample’s battery swap stations, which handle the work automatically, look like backyard sheds with an extra-thick wall. The wall is where the battery modules are stored and charged. There’s no need to dig a hole in the ground underneath the battery swapping station, either, as might be the case if the equipment needed to handle entire big, heavy battery packs.

Because the batteries don’t need high-powered DC fast charging – they have plenty of time to charge inside the hut wall – the battery swapping stations don’t require the kind of high-wattage power connections fast-charging stations do. That simplifies their installation, said Khaled Hassounah, founder and chief executive of Ample.

Also, the vehicle itself can be of any shape or size. An SUV, car or truck doesn’t need to be designed around an Ample battery pack. The battery modules fit into a container on the underside of the vehicle where a battery pack would usually go. The container is adapted to the size and shape of the vehicle. A large vehicle could simply hold more battery modules while a smaller vehicle would hold fewer of them.

Besides Stellantis, Ample is also working with heavy equipment maker Mitsubishi Fuso on a battery-swapping test with commercial trucks in Japan. In the United States, the system is being tested with a variety of different Uber vehicles around the San Francisco Bay area. Ample’s 12 battery-swapping stations in the Bay area are used “a few hundred” times a day, according to the company.

The Ample battery modules can still be charged in the vehicle at a regular EV charger, so drivers would have the option of either plugging in or swapping batteries depending on the situation. As usual, most EV owners could still plug their cars in overnight at home.

Stellantis has not said it will necessarily incorporate the system into its EV models for sale around the world. Next year, Stellantis will use the Ample battery swap system in a fleet of 100 Fiat 500e electric cars in Spain that are part of the company’s Free2Move car-sharing service.

The Fiat 500e, a tiny electric car with a range of about 150 miles, provides a perfect test case for battery swapping, said Ricardo Stamatti-Avila, Stellantis’s vice president for charging and energy.

“If you want to extend the range of a car, the answer right now is you just throw more batteries at it,” he said. “But when you have limited real estate, like in a Fiat 500, that means we’d need to make the car bigger, and then it’s not a Fiat 500 anymore, right?”

Even with larger vehicles, Ample’s battery swapping system could free drivers from having to buy lots of extra battery power they might only rarely use, as they do now. Customers could just rent the extra battery packs they need for the occasional long trip, said Stamatti-Avila.

If the system works well in Spain, he said, Stellantis will look first to commercial fleet customers to start building up an infrastructure of swapping stations. Ordinary retail customers could start using the system once there are a good number of swapping stations available.

On the other hand, if Stellantis’s Spanish experiment doesn’t pan out, this whole battery-swapping thing might just never be talked about again, as happened with Tesla.","['batteries', 'system', 'failed', 'vehicle', 'stellantis', 'battery', 'modules', 'ample', 'size', 'stations', 'swapping', 'vehicles', 'secret', 'tesla']","It seems like an obvious solution, but there have been some famous failures with battery swapping.

144,What is the feast of the seven fishes?,"Whether you’re Italian, Italian American or simply love a seafood spread, cooking up a feast of seven fishes makes for a very special Christmas Eve. In households with roots in the tradition, it’s almost always a family affair, with generations of cooks in the kitchen and favorite foods that return year after year. But anyone can host their own festive seafood feast, and you don’t have to stick to traditional recipes, either.

Here, everything you need to know about the feast of seven fishes, including its history and some of our favorite fish recipes.

What Is Feast of the Seven Fishes?

The Feast of the Seven Fishes is an Italian American Christmas Eve celebration that operates similarly to Thanksgiving, with traditional dishes and practices that span generations, decades and oceans. Known in Italy as La Viglia, which translates to The Eve, as in December 24 or Christmas Eve, The Feast of the Seven Fishes isn’t a religious celebration. Instead, think of it as a big, festive, fish-forward meal. There isn’t a set menu but there are a few dishes most families include, and we’ve got lots of info here that will help you plan a Feast of the Seven Fishes that fits your preferences — and the size of your kitchen.

The History of the Feast of the Seven Fishes

Why do Italian Americans celebrate Christmas Eve with a feast like no other? A confluence of factors led to this tradition.

Firstly, there’s the history of Italy itself. Prior to 1861, the geographic area that’s now Italy was a group of regions, each with its own government. Due to its long coastlines, seafood featured prominently in the cuisines of what we now call southern Italy.

Unfortunately, before and after the unification, southern Italians were also poorer than their northern neighbors, and millions immigrated to the U.S. and other parts of the world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, bringing their food traditions with them. This connection to Southern Italian foodways is why some historians believe Italian Americans honor Christmas Eve with fish-forward meals.

Others note that many Roman Catholics, including those of southern Italian descent, don’t eat meat on Fridays or the eve of some holidays. Additionally, the number seven has Biblical significance: there are seven sacraments and deadly sins in Catholicism.

How to Cook the Feast of the Seven Fishes for Christmas Eve Dinner

The strictest adherents to the seven-fishes tradition will tell you that indeed there should be seven fish on the dinner table; others say that any and all seafood, including shellfish, count toward the final fish tally. The key to committing to cook seven different kinds of seafood is spreading out the dishes throughout the meal; instead of preparing seven whole fish for what would be an excessively large main course spread, offer perhaps three small appetizers, a soup, pasta, then entrée plus a side salad, each with seafood as the focus.

Tips for Shopping and Prepping

Buying the fish:

• Buy the freshest seafood possible from a reputable fish monger. Order what you need a week in advance because it’s a busy time of the year.

Menu planning:

• It’s okay to serve small “tasting-size” portions of each dish. With this in mind, assume each recipe you make will serve 1 1/2 times as many people as it says: a recipe for 4 will serve 6; a recipe for 6 will serve 9; a recipe for 8 will serve 12.

• Plan for two or three courses to be cold or room temperature: there aren’t enough burners on the stove for seven.

• You don’t need a ton of side dishes; many of the fish dishes have one built in.

Setting up for the feast

• Consider how many plates you own: we love serving each dish as a separate course, but only when we have enough dishes to carry it off. Three dishes served on one plate is fine.

• Decorations are traditionally Christmas-inspired, given that this feast is thrown on Christmas Eve.

145,How to get rid of ladybugs in the house,"So many homeowners can mark the coming of fall by an unwelcome visit from one the garden’s most recognizable beneficial insects and perhaps hundreds of her friends.

Ladybugs will not harm your home, but that doesn’t keep homeowners from seeking ways to get rid of ladybugs (also known as lady beetles) that aggregate on inside walls to escape the onset of cool weather and hibernate for the winter.

The interlopers are the Asian lady beetle (Harmonia axyridis), which were imported to the US from the 1960s to 1990s by federal, state, and private entomologists and released in an attempt to control insect pests such as aphids. Ladybugs, after all, are voracious predators.

Asian lady beetles can be identified by a small M or W, depending on how you look at them, on the shield-like section behind their head. Unlike the native lady beetle, the Asian species likes to aggregate inside to overwinter.

Why are There Ladybugs in My House?

The Asian lady beetles cluster inside your home for a very simple reason: to stay warm. This aggregation is triggered as the temperatures start to drop, so homeowners in northern states may notice the behavior sooner than the rest of the country.

The ladybugs are attracted to lighter areas that have a dark feature, such as a crevice or a crack in a southeast-facing wall or window illuminated by the fall sunlight, says Dr. Brian Forschler, a professor of entomology at the University of Georgia.

The ladybugs enter your home through these cracks, and when they find a comfortable spot to hang out for the winter, they leave a chemical marker behind that serves as a calling card for the rest of their friends. That’s why homeowners will spot ladybugs gathering in the same location year after year.

Are Ladybugs Harmful?

Ladybugs won’t damage your home or harm your pets. They don’t eat wood and they are not disease carriers. They can bite you — what Dr. Forschler says would feel like a pinprick — but ladybugs are much better known and appreciated for the way they devour insect pests in the garden. An adult lady beetle is capable of eating up to 270 aphids per day.

Among the insects ladybugs feed on are aphids, mites, scales, thrips and white flies.

How to Get Rid of Ladybugs

While not harmful, they can be considered a nuisance if they gather indoors in large numbers. If agitated or disturbed, by a broom for example, ladybugs will release foul-smelling liquids — a defensive reaction known as “reflex bleeding” — that can stain drapes or clothes.

For this reason, Dr. Forschler says the best way to get rid of them is to vacuum them up and then dispose of them.

How to Keep Ladybugs Away

You could use either vinegar or ammonia-based cleaners to clean the spot where the ladybugs aggregated, removing the pheromones marking the ladybug’s hangout. But to keep ladybugs from invading your home, you’ll need to seal up the cracks through which they entered.

“Removing the pheromone might reduce the number that ‘decide’ to spend the winter at that site, (but) it probably won’t stop them as well as sealing the cracks and crevices on that side of the building,” says Dr. Forschler.

That would mean caulking your home’s exterior crevices and the cracks around doors and windows — and there likely are a lot of them. Maybe you and any of your houseguests just look the other way?

“Keeping them out is entirely possible, but hardly practical,” says Dr. Forschler. “If you can convince people not to worry about (the ladybugs), that’s huge.”

If you have a serious infestation, call a professional pest control company for help.","['known', 'homeowners', 'forschler', 'cracks', 'ladybugs', 'dr', 'lady', 'inside', 'house', 'rid', 'spot']","Ladybugs will not harm your home, but that doesn’t keep homeowners from seeking ways to get rid of ladybugs (also known as lady beetles) that aggregate on inside walls to escape the onset of cool weather and hibernate for the winter.

146,Opinion: The finest speech ever given in a presidential debate,"Editor’s Note: Todd Graham is a professor of debate at Southern Illinois University.

CNN —

I’ve watched more than 8,000 debates. Admittedly, my life is not terribly exciting. But after Wednesday night’s fourth Republican presidential debate at the University of Alabama, I was rollin’ like the tide.

If you were lucky enough to watch, you were treated to the finest speech ever given in a presidential debate. Let’s get right to it — here’s how the four candidates scored:

Chris Christie: A+

Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images

Since all great speeches should have a title, I’m naming it “Chris Christie’s Retribution Speech.”

To make a memorable argument in a debate, you need at least three things. First, the issue being debated has to be salient. Second, you need to lock down your position with good examples and evidence. Finally, your delivery is crucial. But even that’s not enough. For an argument to stand out in a debate, it must contain all three of those elements — and it must be a position not yet heard by the debating audience.

The “Chris Christie Retribution Speech” met all the criteria.

First: was the topic salient? Indeed it was, and the former governor of New Jersey knew it. Here’s part of his answer when asked what he thought of former President Donald Trump’s comments this week, that if elected again he would be a dictator only on “day one.”

“Completely predictable,” said Christie. “This is an angry, bitter man, who now wants to be back as president because he wants to exact retribution on anyone who has disagreed with him, anyone who has tried to hold him to account for his own conduct…. Do I think he was kidding when he said he was a dictator? All you have to do is look at the history…”

Second: Christie’s reasoning was solid, and his explanation of Trump’s popularity was smart debating. He took a weakness (Trump is polling way higher than Christie) and turned it into an attack on his debate opponents. Christie continued, “You want to know why those poll numbers are where they are? Because folks like these three guys on stage make it seem like his conduct is acceptable.”

Third: You really need to watch his delivery. It’s a 2-minute speech, and it’s glorious. Watch Christie’s nonverbal movement and listen to his cadence. Hear the phrases and where Christie places the emphasis. One line stands out: Trump’s phrase of “I am your retribution,” when quoted by Christie, was chilling.

Christie might have just given the single most important speech in presidential debating history. It was certainly the finest.

Other Christie stand-out moments: Confronting fellow debater Vivek Ramaswamy, who was once again being himself. Christie told him to stop insulting Nikki Haley, said Ramaswamy had a smart-ass mouth, and gave this knock-out blow: “All he knows how to do is insult good people who’ve committed their lives to public service and not say anything that moves the ball down the field for the United States.”

Christie continually chastised Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and others for not answering the question, astutely channelling the audience’s frustration with politicians’ question dodging.

Finally, when talking about the sensitive topic of transgender care, while others like Ramaswamy and DeSantis were vilifying transgender kids and their parents, Christie reminded the audience of the sheer hypocrisy. “Republicans believe in less government, not more…yet we want to take parental rights away,” he said.

And while Christie said he does not personally favor gender-affirming care, he’d rather have parents decide with their children rather than the “jokers” in congress overriding parent’s decisions.

Nikki Haley: A

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

The former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina governor was lucky enough to collect some new donors this week. And that news, along with Haley’s rising poll numbers, should have been accompanied by a trigger warning because DeSantis and Ramaswamy began the debate with a barrage of attacks against her.

And some of the criticisms landed — such as Haley’s apparent double standard on our relationship with China, and that she is taking too much money from big corporation leaders, thereby making her indebted to them.

Haley was fortunate that the attacks were scattershot. Usually in presidential debates, the person getting teamed up on eventually wears down. Given the lack of a uniform attack from her opponents, an absence of specificity on some of the critiques and the fact that Christie defended Haley, the arguments against her simply didn’t stick. In fact, thanks to Ramaswamy’s excessively nasty and rude vitriol, I wouldn’t be surprised if Haley didn’t get even more support from a sympathetic audience.

But let’s not forget that Haley, if given the time, can probably answer most of the criticisms. She defended her corporate relations, such as Boeing, with ease. Haley’s policy focus was evident once again; and she had an excellent answer for why we should prioritize supply issues when dealing with this difficult market and inflation. Haley also reminded us that deficits (and inflation) aren’t just a Democrat problem because Trump’s tenure only made it worse.

What I liked most about Haley in this debate was her demeanor. Todd Graham

What I liked most about Haley in this debate was her demeanor. I’ve criticized Haley in previous debates for being too eager to jump into the fray and quibble, especially about unimportant issues. Not this time. Haley was much better at selecting the time and place for her rebuttals.

How she handled the tag-teaming from DeSantis and Ramaswamy was impressive. Most people would have lost their temper (Christie was on the edge) and let it affect their debating. Instead, Haley went the opposite direction and played it cool and calm. It was the perfect attitude adjustment.

Even after being called a fascist by Ramaswamy, Haley simply smiled and said, “I love all the attention fellas. Thank you for that.” And then again after Ramaswamy’s flailing stream of consciousness insults, a debate moderator asked Haley if she’d like to respond. She replied with a bit of a smile. “No. It’s not worth my time to respond to him.” BAM.

Ron DeSantis: C

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Some things never change. Florida’s governor simply can’t fix his nonverbal communication, especially his tortured facial expressions. It’s baffling and now I couldn’t stop staring.

On foreign policy, DeSantis’s strengths were talking about the approach Florida took to China, but he missed badly when explaining the legality of his previous rhetoric about killing fentanyl smugglers, vigilante-style.

DeSantis began this answer, as he did several times in the debate, by telling a story. The problem is that his stories are forced and poorly timed. Answer the question first, and then, if you must, tell a story. But I prefer my presidential debates to be story-free. They just don’t work in debates like they do on the stump.

Finally, DeSantis has no transitions in his debating style. He attacks, introduces new topics, and randomly begins telling stories with no set-up and no clear way out.

DeSantis is still a C debater. He’s not terrible. He’s not terrific. He’s just Ron.

Vivek Ramaswamy: F

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

What’s a troll’s biggest fear? Being ignored. Trolls crave attention. You can read elsewhere about all of Ramaswamy’s antics. (Each debate he seems to be trying to outdo his previous one, so you can only imagine how ridiculous he was at times with his mean spirited, undignified verbal vomit.)

Imagine how upset Ramaswamy must have been when Haley simply ignored his attacks and said he wasn’t worth her time. Not responding to him is probably worse for his ego than any verbal insult.

You know you’re in trouble when a presidential moderator — Elizabeth Vargas — asks you point-blank about one of your policy proposals. “Is this a serious policy proposal, and if it isn’t, why do you keep repeating it?”

At one point in the debate, Ramaswamy had a good debate strategy, but failed to successfully execute it. His plan seemed to be to highlight Haley’s lack of knowledge about Ukraine by demonstrating basic facts she is unaware of. It’s a winnable strategy. My teams have used similar strategies to highlight our opponent’s ignorance on any given topic.

But Ramaswamy undermined his “gotcha” moment. Ramaswamy demanded Haley name three provinces in Ukraine where she might send troops because he figured she’d be stumped.

Unfortunately, and this cannot be overstated, nobody cares. Apparently, Haley has not fully memorized the military strategy in various regions in Ukraine. You know what Ramaswamy included with this burger? Nothing, that’s what.

My grade is as Christie predicted when he called out Ramaswamy: “This is the fourth debate that you would be voted in the first 20 minutes as the most obnoxious blowhard in America.”","['ramaswamy', 'speech', 'debating', 'opinion', 'presidential', 'given', 'debate', 'desantis', 'answer', 'haley', 'debates', 'christie', 'finest']","But after Wednesday night’s fourth Republican presidential debate at the University of Alabama, I was rollin’ like the tide.

CNN Opinion asked political contributors to weigh in on the third Republican presidential debate of the 2024 race. The views expressed in these commentaries are their own.

The wild, final Republican presidential debate of 2023, filled with vicious, personal attacks by the candidates, demonstrated once again that the nomination is Donald Trump’s to lose because all but one of his challengers are too frightened to take him on directly.

Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, identified the stakes early in the debate by going directly after Trump. “The truth needs to be spoken. He is unfit,” he said. “There is no bigger issue in this race.”

But the other three candidates failed to follow Christie’s lead, and instead tore into one another.

“Nikki, you were bankrupt when you left the UN,” Vivek Ramaswamy said to Nikki Haley early in the debate, accusing her of enriching herself since leaving the government by her ties to big corporations. “You are corrupt.”

Later, in case anyone had missed the point, Ramaswamy held up a notepad on which he had scrawled “NIKKI = CORRUPT” in big letters.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis attacked Haley as well, accusing her of bowing to the wishes of her fast-growing network of big-money contributors.

“Nikki will cave to those big donors when it counts,” DeSantis charged.

Haley tried to shake it off: “I love all the attention fellas, thank you,” she responded, denying the allegations of corruption.

But like DeSantis and Ramaswamy, the former South Carolina governor never truly answered the spot-on observation by Christie about the former president and Republican frontrunner: “His conduct is unacceptable. He is unfit.”

With a commanding lead in Iowa, where caucus votes will be cast in 40 days, Trump has boycotted the debates, secure in the knowledge that his would-be rivals would largely avoid mentioning him — positively or negatively — in every debate.

“This is the problem with my three colleagues: They’re afraid to offend Donald Trump,” Christie said, in the most clear description of the stakes. “You have to be willing to offend with the truth.”

For all the insults and attacks, the candidates other than Christie did their best to avoid offending the front-runner. It was, collectively, their one clear success.

Geoff Duncan: Haley’s success continues – but it’s far from enough

Geoff Duncan CNN

Two things were true heading into Wednesday night’s GOP fourth and final presidential debate: former US Ambassador Nikki Haley had momentum and former President Donald Trump remains the frontrunner, despite his legal challenges. After this debate, it seems clear Haley knows ignoring Trump is not an option and she is preparing to take him on.

In two of the three early states, Haley has emerged as the clear second place candidate to Trump. In Iowa, a Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa poll showed Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis tied at 16%, after a 10-point surge from Haley, and Trump with a 27-point lead. In New Hampshire, a University of New Hampshire/CNN poll last month put Haley at 20% and DeSantis at 9% – and Trump at the top with 42%. In South Carolina, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in October showed Trump at 53% and Haley at 22%, double her nearest competitor.

Her success made her an immediate target. As Haley deflected broadsides from DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy, she also turned her fire toward Trump, criticizing him by name on issues important to GOP voters, including China and spending.

To be sure, Haley could do more to stand up to Trump. No candidate in the race has been willing to take on the former president with more vigor than former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. As he pointed out, Trump is an “angry, bitter man,” and he rightly took his competitors to task for indicating that they could support even a convicted Trump in a previous debate.

Two things are necessary for Republicans to dethrone Trump: consolidation of the field and a willingness to take on the frontrunner. We’ve achieved the former – Wednesday’s debate was half the size of the fourth showdown in 2015. Let’s hope this matchup marked the start of the latter.

Kate Bedingfield: Biden got a lot of good fodder

Kate Bedingfield (CNN)

If you’re the Biden campaign, you probably didn’t see anything in tonight’s debate that changes the likelihood that former President Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee. What you did see is a Republican field that refuses to take on one of their biggest vulnerabilities in the general election: Their support for abortion bans.

There was not a single question tonight about the issue that has defined every election since the fall of Roe v Wade in June of 2022. Republicans can ignore it in their own primary debate, but they can’t ignore it at the ballot box.

The Biden campaign should call out that omission, press the issue with media and force the Republican candidates to answer for their extreme positions; they all have past votes and quotes supporting bans of some sort.

The president’s campaign can also use any number of moments throughout the evening to reinforce its message that the GOP is Trump’s party and that MAGA extremism is the cost of admission to be a Republican today.

Three of the four candidates didn’t speak up to say that Trump promising to be a dictator on day one was disqualifying, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis seemed to argue that Trump didn’t govern like enough of a dictator when he was in office and a President DeSantis would fix that. Only former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie made a sustained and consistent argument against Trump throughout the debate, as he has in previous debates – and it doesn’t seem to be moving his numbers in the right direction.

For the Biden campaign, tonight gave them good fodder to push on issues that are general election vulnerabilities for Republicans and continue to paint the GOP as extreme.

Sophia A. Nelson: Haley showed she’s still her party’s best bet in November

Sophia A. Nelson Andrew Sample Photography

Nikki Haley came under hostile fire in the GOP debate Wednesday, attacked from all sides by the other candidates. But as in the previous debates, it was Vivek Ramaswamy who went after the former UN ambassador with sexist and ugly attacks.

Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s vigorous defense of Haley was a powerful moment. Christie scored big points — and likely made inroads with millions of college-educated women who know what sexism feels like, coming from the likes of an obnoxious smart-mouth like Ramaswamy.

Christie remained focused like a laser beam on the absent GOP front runner, former President Donald Trump, who is leading by over 40 points nationally. He tried to goad his three GOP rivals into answering whether Trump was fit to hold the presidency, but none of them would be drawn, no matter how hard he pressed.

Meanwhile, Ramaswamy arduously — and falsely — insisted that the 2020 election was stolen. Let’s hope that Ramaswamy, who seems to offend everyone, has made his last showing on a national debate stage. He is not just divisive but — to borrow a term from former President Donald J. Trump — he’s the epitome of a “nasty” man.

In addition to being the only woman, Haley looked like the lone adult on the stage. She kept her cool while the male candidates barked and pointed fingers at one another.

Yes, Haley took some hits Wednesday night. But over the course of the debate, she played it smart, showing once again that if the GOP hopes to win against Joe Biden next November, she’s the party’s best bet.

Jill Filipovic: How Haley won the gender war

In the Republican presidential debate Wednesday night, one candidate was the clear target of most the ire. It wasn’t the far-and-away frontrunner, former President Donald Trump, who didn’t even bother showing up. It was Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador and former governor of South Carolina, who was hit with blow after blow from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy.

Haley is fair game for criticism. She is, after all, running for president. In New Hampshire and South Carolina, she’s running ahead of all three of the men on stage Wednesday night; in Iowa, she’s neck-and-neck with DeSantis. But the attacks on Haley were less measured critique than hostile indignation, a tone that DeSantis and Ramaswamy seemed to largely reserve for their attacks on her.

Ramaswamy was smarmy with everyone, but seemed particularly antagonistic to Haley, whom he has personally attacked throughout his campaign.

Despite the barrage, Haley held her own on stage, at one point refusing to even dignify Ramaswamy’s bashings with a response. The audience loved it, laughing and applauding in response.

Haley is striking a difficult balance, wanting to come across as a Thatcher-esque figure – a conservative woman who gets things done – without being painted as too feminist, domineering or schoolmarmish. Her dismissal of Ramaswamy fit the bill: She came off as above the fray, while he looked like an irritating child the adults decide is best ignored.

But she wasn’t the only one speaking in her defense. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who seems to be running less to win than to be a voice of anti-Trump reason, defended Haley at length from Ramaswamy at one standout moment. This, too, had a gendered element: Christie taking on the role of white knight, swooping into to defend Haley’s honor.

Perhaps he would have done the same for any other politician he respected. But the optics – the sense of Christie as a stand-up guy – wouldn’t have been quite as strong.

In a vacuum, this GOP debate would suggest that while the party hasn’t moved forward on women’s rights, it has progressed on its treatment of individual powerful women. After all, the three debate moderators were female, and while Haley was dog-piled by DeSantis and Ramaswamy, she wasn’t treated to the kind of hostile sexist attacks and condescension women in politics have so often seen, perhaps most notably 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at the hands of Trump.

But Wednesday’s debate was far from the full picture: The most notoriously noxious and sexist candidate, who continues to enjoy the enthusiastic backing of his party and its voters, wasn’t even on the stage.

Patrick T. Brown: Calvin Coolidge? Really?

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis may have had his best debate of the campaign Wednesday night – whether it was too little, too late will be up to the voters. His first answer out of the gate dinged former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley for her distance from the Republican Party base on issues like gender transition surgeries for youth, and he wasn’t afraid to mix it up with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy at various points throughout the evening.

But DeSantis’ final answer to a moderator’s question left me questioning to what extent he has learned the lessons of former President Donald Trump. Asked which president he’d most like to model himself after, DeSantis avoided the predictable mention of Ronald Reagan by citing Calvin Coolidge, a favorite of limited-government-type conservatives. “Silent Cal knew the proper role of the federal government,” he said.

That may be so. But a Coolidge-inspired approach to federal policy – one that prioritized saying little and focusing on cutting spending – is one better fit for the Republican Party of the tea party era than for the brash, muscular vision embraced by Trump.

Applauding “Silent Cal” may win the hearts of conservative wonks, but it suggests that the Florida governor may still hew a little too closely to the pre-Trump consensus to appeal to the former president’s supporters.

Roxanne Jones: Haley’s war talk won’t win her votes

Roxanne Jones CNN

Nikki Haley has often sounded like the most commonsense presidential candidate on the GOP presidential debates and Wednesday night wasn’t the exception. There’s no doubt this explains her surprising rise in national polls, challenging Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for second place behind former President Donald Trump.

But Haley fell flat at the fourth and final GOP debate Wednesday night at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. For me, the former US ambassador lost major points when the talk turned to war and she responded like a Doomsday despot.

According to Haley, America should send troops to “take out the cartel in Mexico.” She said she would take a much different and more aggressive approach to deal with Iran, China, Ukraine and Hamas in Gaza. “We need to make sure that we have full clarity that there is a reason again that the Taiwanese want to help Ukrainians because they know if Ukraine wins, China won’t invade Taiwan. There’s a reason the Ukrainians want to help Israelis because they know that if Iran wins, Russia wins. These are all connected but what wins all of that is a strong America, not a weak America. And that’s what Joe Biden has given us.”

For Haley, whose husband, National Guardsman Maj. Michael Haley, is now dispatched in Djibouti in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Horn of Africa, America’s military might is limitless. Yet, her war mongering felt tone deaf considering America’s waning support for military intervention around the world.

In every GOP debate, Haley has gained momentum with her sharp intellect and ability to handle herself under attacks. And though, she continued to show she could go toe-to-toe with her critics, it’s doubtful her performance Wednesday night was enough to convince Republican voters that she’s the right woman for the job. In the end, after all the bickering and cheeky insults, it’s seemingly still Trump—polling at almost 60% nationally—whom most GOP voters want to see as their nominee.

During Wednesday night’s fourth and final GOP presidential debate it was interesting to see the clear line drawn down the middle of the stage separating the quartet of candidates into two factions: Chaos candidates stage left – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy, both of whom have seemingly interpreted the mantra “go big or go home” as an exhortation to triple down on absurd assertions and wild promises – and Gravitas Grabbers stage right – former US ambassador Nikki Haley and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, seeking to play grownup and look presidential, aiming measured potshots at former president Donald Trump, while trying to fly above the ad hominems and spitballs being tossed cross-stage from the other wing.

The split between Ramaswamy and DeSantis was most prominent in the debate segment focused on China. DeSantis warned of China exporting authoritarianism around the world after invading and toppling Taiwan. “The 21st century has to be an American century. We cannot let it be a Chinese century,” he thumped.

Ramaswamy, meanwhile, accused Haley of being supported by those who “grovel to China” and said he stood by his bizarre proposal to open a branch of the NRA in Taiwan and give every citizen a gun and training on how to use it, which Christie sarcastically rebutted by noting that the US doesn’t have “constitutional authority over Taiwan to give them a Second Amendment,” before pivoting to a critique of Trump’s China tariffs as responsible for skyrocketing inflation (so it wasn’t just Bidenomics after all!)

Haley’s language was similarly restrained, noting that her priorities to rein in China included winning the war in Ukraine, building a pan-Asian regional alliance and moving strategic manufacturing to friendly countries. (And, in an admission that surely won’t play well with the base, she noted that the supply chains for masks and Covid testing both run through China, highlighting their critical importance in combating the pandemic.)

Nevertheless, all four were clearly in agreement that China should be seen as America’s enemy number one. Given that a significant number of Democrats also hold that belief, if you’re Asian American and one of the probably few people who watched this debate, the exchange on stage felt like an uncomfortable preview of the anti-China rhetoric that will be employed by members of both parties as a means to unite voters around a common enemy, once campaign season begins in earnest.

Carrie Sheffield: The thing that was lacking on the debate stage

Carrie Sheffield Barry Morgenstein

With sparks flying at each other instead of at the malaise gripping our country, Wednesday’s GOP debate sadly lacked consistent voices offering a bold, strong, positive vision.

Much of the debate seemed wasted energy, with candidates attacking one another instead of dissecting progressivism and the Biden agenda, which has resulted in President Joe Biden’s incredibly low poll numbers. Americans hold a dismal view of the president’s governance, as inflation-fueled Bidenomics helps push home ownership out of reach for millions.

When the candidates did tackle problems, they offered a smart diagnosis. Both entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis correctly identified what Ramaswamy called “bureaucrats in those three-letter agencies that are writing regulations that Congress never gave them the authority to write,” and DeSantis called out “this massive fourth branch of government, this administrative state which is imposing its will on us and is being weaponized against us.”

By reforming regulatory red tape, some economists estimate the US economy could expand by hundreds of billions of dollars each year. But the candidates didn’t offer a more proactive vision of their own formulas for economic success.

The debate also saw much talk about Israel and Hamas – and with it another missed opportunity. The candidates wasted a key moment to reach female voters by not pointing to some progressives hypocritically claiming to support women but hedging on protecting Israeli women from rape. This was an opportune time for Republicans to show women who truly stands with us. It is conservatives who offer resolute and unwavering commitment to protect women from bodily harm and sexual degradation.

Instead of a circular firing squad, conservatives need greater discipline and focus against Biden to defeat progressivism in 2024 and offer a positive vision of what they stand for, not just what they’re against.

Susanne Ramirez de Arellano: A Trump-like Republican response on immigration

Susanne Ramirez de Arellano Frank Moya

During Wednesday’s presidential debate, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy decried what he described as President Joe Biden’s authoritarian streak. “We’re marching toward fascism under Biden,” Ramaswamy declared.

That statement was rich, coming the day after a town hall in Iowa at which the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, former President Donald Trump, said he would act as a dictator on “day one” of a new presidential term. “We’re closing the border and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling.’ After that I’m not a dictator,” Trump said.

Trump and his allies have also kept open the possibility of renewing his administration’s policy of separating families at the southern US border.

The word “dictator” should not be taken lightly by anyone. For many voters, especially Latinos, the word conjures images of authoritarian rulers like Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet — not an American president.

I was expecting that the candidates would address what Trump said. They didn’t. Chris Christie called Trump a dictator, and that’s where the discussion ended.

In fact, on immigration, the Republican candidates at Wednesday’s debate sounded a lot like Trump. They demonized immigrants, many of whom are Latinos. And they didn’t stay far from what the former president has said he would do: deport huge numbers of migrants and militarize the border.

Catch and deport, Ambassador Nikki Haley said on Wednesday, is how she’d handle the immigration question. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis proclaimed he would adopt a policy of shooting on sight any undocumented immigrant crossing the border, who might or might not be a drug trafficker. There was little in any of it that seemed likely to sway many Latino voters to embrace the Republican presidential candidate.

According to a recent Axios-Ipsos Latino Poll conducted with Telemundo, 32% of all respondents said neither Democrats nor Republicans care about Latinos. That result would seem to raise the stakes for both parties, as they attempt to win the support of this vitally important bloc of voters.

The thinking of the GOP contenders seemed to be that Latinos, a key voting bloc, are abandoning the Democrats for the Republican Party, out of a fear that the Democratic Party’s “wokeness” will lead to some sort of socialist authoritarianism.

But, nonpartisan and unaffiliated Latino voters, many of whom are young voters, are fast becoming one of the largest swing voter groups in the next elections. And there was little in Wednesday night’s debate that would lead them – or other Latinos – to conclude that the Republican candidates on the stage, or the party in general, have their best interests at heart.

W. James Antle III: The sound and the fury of Christie’s attacks

Chris Christie garnered rave reviews for his no-hold-barred performance in the fourth Republican presidential debate. The former New Jersey governor has made taking the fight to former President Donald Trump – who has yet to show up to a debate – central to his campaign, and he did so again on Wednesday.

Yet as he reprised his role in the fourth presidential debate Wednesday night, he was unable to dispute a key point made by moderator Megyn Kelly: that broadsides against Trump have done little to diminish the former president’s popularity with Republicans.

If anything, Christie has probably damaged his own.

Christie even seemed to concede the point. “It’s often very difficult to be the only person on the stage who’s telling the truth,” he replied, seeming to implore higher-polling candidates — who he said may “have future aspirations, maybe those future aspirations are now or maybe they’re four years from now” — to join him in targeting Trump.

Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, now locked in a fierce battle for second place, will eventually have to figure out how to resolve this same quandary. A Christie-style full frontal assault against Trump is clearly a political loser in a Republican primary.

But to beat Trump, they will have to figure out how to run against him, and their more subtle criticisms of “chaos” or the former president’s age have only gotten them so far.

The candidates all complain about the polls, but they can read them as well as anyone else.

Lanhee J. Chen: Voters are looking for health care solutions. The GOP contenders came up short.

Lanhee J. Chen Lanhee J. Chen/ECG Studios, LLC

Health care did not come up until the end of Wednesday night’s presidential debate, but the issue has the potential to vex Republicans well into next year’s general election in November. The topic has become a major focus of the 2024 campaign — and the target of attacks from President Joe Biden and his surrogates — after former president Donald Trump declared last week that he would get rid of Obamacare if elected again.

None of the answers from the GOP presidential contenders so far should give Republican voters comfort that their nominee, whether it ends up being Trump or one of the contenders on the debate stage, will be poised to adequately rebut those attacks.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis promised a new and better alternative to Obamacare but wasn’t able to provide additional details on exactly how he would lower health costs, which have climbed since Obamacare’s passage in 2010. Nor did he appear able to offer consumers more choice, something that the law has curtailed.

Vivek Ramaswamy made some valid points about a lack of transparency in our health care system but offered few specific ideas about how to address this weakness. And his indulgence of crazy conspiracy theories distracted from any strong answers he may have given.

Republican candidates would be smart to get smart on health care issues, and fast. There’s no dearth of ideas from conservative policy analysts and thinkers offering market-based reform on specific ways to expand incentives for health savings, increase transparency in health spending, and lower costs. These would all be ways to improve the health system in ways that Obamacare did not and cannot.

CNN —

I last saw Norman Lear in February of 2020, when I was part of the team producing the documentary series, “History of the Sitcom,” for CNN.

Bill Carter Bill Carter

How could we have done that history justice without hearing from arguably its most prolific, successful and impactful practitioner?

Norman was 98 years old at the time. The shoot was set up at his office in the Culver City section of Los Angeles. Norman, who had a staff of development executives working for him, remained a busy producer, almost half a century past the era that made him a legend — the era of “The Jeffersons,” “Good Times,” “Maude,” “Sanford and Son,” and the seminal comedy that started it all, and changed the television medium forever, “All in the Family.”

I had spoken with Norman many times before, going back to the 1980s, and he was, in all of those conversations, insightful, articulate and full of anecdotal details from his career. In 2015, I moderated an event with him at the Museum of the Moving Image (appropriately located in Queens, New York, home of his most famous character, Archie Bunker). I asked him about the backstory behind the creation of “All in the Family,” some of which was familiar to me:

The two early pilots were rejected by ABC. Norman’s perception was that the flaw in the pilot was the casting of the younger couple, Gloria and Mike, and the show finally met his expectations when Sally Struthers and Rob Reiner joined the cast. However, he never considered altering the stars, Carroll O’Connor and Jean Stapleton, nor even a single line of the startlingly offensive (for that time) dialogue, despite pressure from the show’s new network, CBS.

But he did surprise me that day by saying that he had first tried to convince Mickey Rooney to play Archie, only to have that star from Hollywood’s golden age recoil at the names Archie was calling people — he tossed around words that were commonly used to refer to people of other races, but which now are considered repulsive slurs.

Norman remembered every detail, even the name of Rooney’s agent.

For the doc-series interview, I thought I should research deeper, and dig into Lear’s personal history. From that research, I learned he had served in the Army Air Corps in Italy during WWII. When I asked him about that, he described flying 57 missions (a staggering number) as a radio operator on a B-17.

That hit home. “My Dad was a radio operator,” I told him. Dad flew 33 missions from his base in England; but the job — learn Morse code, deliver regular position reports, fire a .50 caliber machine gun when under attack — was the same in either theater of war, as was the frequently intense combat.

Hearing about my Dad changed the look in Norman’s eyes, as though his recollection was being pulled much further back into the past. He started to tell war stories, including one particular story of how a mission kept getting delayed by weather, until his crew was finally told to shut it down for the day. But the B-17 was able to take off — only to be shot down, with his best Army friend onboard, who was killed in action. This had happened more than three-quarters of a century earlier, but the loss of his friend filled his eyes with tears. Mine too.

It struck me that the reason Lear’s best comedies were such massive hits came down to an accumulation of factors, from timing to casting to his crucial grasping that America was ready for TV comedy that wasn’t based on Mom burning the roast.

But the other essential was Lear’s understanding of the human condition.

Norman always said that Archie contained elements of his own father: the exaggerated gruffness, the grievance psyche, the casual delivery of racial and ethnic slurs.

But he argued that almost everybody had an Archie in their lives, and you couldn’t just dismiss them as narrow-minded bigots; their families still loved them, as America came to love Archie — much to the distress of social scientists of that era.

I connected with that too. I grew up in the borough next to Queens, Brooklyn, and the generation above me shared much with Archie Bunker. In the New York of that era, neighborhoods were bastions of tribalism: The Irish didn’t mix with the Italians who didn’t mix with the Jews. And none of them mixed with the Blacks or Hispanics.

Denigration was a given. Outsiders were unworthy.

My tribe was Irish. From my earliest years I heard my uncles drop slurs without thinking much about them. One uncle never missed “All in the Family.” His Irish tribal blood ran thick, and Archie (played by an actor named O’Connor) was instantly recognizable. The conventional ethnic insults passed my uncle’s lips regularly. But he had fought too, in North Africa and Sicily. And I knew he had a soft heart. He wasn’t filled with venom; just the residue of ancient prejudices.

Lear, a classic Hollywood liberal, who even started up his own organization to advance progressive causes, was able to infuse bigoted Archie with enough identifiable human qualities and frailties that a viewer never doubted his counter-culture-warrior son-in-law, as well as his long-suffering but devoted wife, would embrace him in any time of trouble.

As I would have my Irish uncle.

One aspect of Lear’s genius often gets overlooked. He was surely shaking up the nation’s social consciousness, arguing, more theatrically than Lincoln, for a return to the better angels of our nature.

But 40 million people weren’t tuning in each week for sermons on tolerance and acceptance. Norman Lear’s great accomplishment was putting all our ugly biases on display and making us laugh at them. Hard.

CNN —

The iconic occupied Palestinian territories’ city of Bethlehem will undergo a profound departure this year from its usual jubilant atmosphere.

Rateb Rabie Courtesy Rateb Rabie

For Palestinians, Christmas in Bethlehem represents a window to the world. It has long been synonymous with joy and hope, and an occasion to commemorate the place of birth of the Christmas story itself.

Picture the vibrant streets adorned with festive lights, the air filled with the melodies of choirs and boy scouts parading with their musical instruments, while those who are celebrating taste traditional Palestinian Arabic food.

Nestled in the heart of Bethlehem is the place revered as the birthplace of Jesus, the prince of peace.

This year, however, there will only be a shadow of the dazzling Christmas tree in Manger Square, where Christians, Muslims and visitors from around the world usually gather to celebrate.

Bethlehem will stand dark and deserted – a poignant reflection of the suffering endured by the Palestinian people, particularly in the Gaza Strip.

Earlier last month, the Patriarchs and Heads of Churches in Jerusalem called on their congregations to forgo the customary celebrations, while still upholding the religious and spiritual aspects of Christmas.

This departure from tradition was not an easy decision, as church leaders grappled with the difficult choice of canceling the festivities in the occupied Palestinian territories, Jordan and Israel.

Bishop William Shomali, the General Vicar and Patriarchal Vicar for Jerusalem and Palestine of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, emphasized the somber mood behind the decision. “How can we celebrate Christmas when thousands of Palestinians got killed and injured and thousands of houses were destroyed in Gaza?” he told me.

“The same atmosphere of sadness prevails for the Israeli civilian losses. It is time for compassion and solidarity, not for joyful and worldly celebrations,” he added.

The reality is stark. Since October 7, over 16,000 Palestinians have been reported killed as a result of Israeli attacks, while 42,000 others bear the impacts of injury.

Of those killed, 70% are children and women. Thousands of homes lie in ruins, displacing 1.7 million people who now grapple with the harsh realities of life virtually without electricity, fuel, fresh water, food and medicine.

These devastating statistics – sourced from the Ministry of Health in Gaza, which is Hamas-run – highlight the human cost of the conflict that has persisted since the Israeli occupation 56 years ago.

Gaza’s small Christian community is no exception to the most recent destruction. When I recently spoke by phone with Sister Nabila Saleh of the Rosary Sisters in Gaza, she described her pain as she told me that 53 households were destroyed and 19 Palestinian Christians of the approximately 1,000 remaining Christians in Gaza had been killed.

While this Christmas void will resonate as a tragedy for Palestinians, Christmas in Bethlehem is not just a religious event. It is a day of national significance, fostering cooperation and unity between Christians and Muslims living in Palestine as well as between them and religious communities abroad.

Each year, thousands of pilgrims make their way to Bethlehem, gathering as a beacon of peace, reconciliation and togetherness and sending a powerful message to the world.

Wretchedly, the Israeli occupation has significantly impacted religious tourism in the Holy Land for decades, especially in Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Hotels now remain empty or closed, souvenir shops are shut down, and consequently, unemployment is high.

Exacerbated by the war in Gaza, the decision to cancel the Christmas festivities this year will have a profound impact on Bethlehem’s economy, which is 90% dependent on tourism. In times of crisis and adversity, we turn to the words of Psalms 34:18, which remind us that: “The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.”

It is worth noting that Palestinian Arab Christians hold a crucial role as natural bridges to peace Rateb Rabie

This psalm resonates with all of us Christians as we hope for a swift end to suffering and a prayer for justice amid adversity. It is worth noting that Palestinian Arab Christians hold a crucial role as natural bridges to peace. Rooted in the same aspirations, culture, history and language as Palestinian Muslims, they also share a history of faith with Jews.

This uniquely positions them to connect with diverse communities and to serve as catalysts for dialogue and understanding between Muslims and Jews and on a broader level with the support of Western counterparts.

As the Christmas season approaches, the absence of festivities in Bethlehem serves as a poignant reminder of the urgent need for a lasting peace. This Christmas presents a special opportunity to shed light on the struggles faced by Palestinian Christians, Palestinian Muslims, and Israeli Jews alike, with the hope that renewed focus and dialogue will pave the way for a path to reconciliation.

In a recent telephone conversation, Archbishop Atallah Hanna of Sebastia from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem told me that “canceling the Christmas festivities and the spiritual meaning of Christmas are both a message to the world that the suffering people of Gaza need peace, justice and humanitarian assistance.” He continued, “It’s a call for a ceasefire now. Pray with me for the innocent victims.”

In a world where divisions often overshadow common ground, Christmas in Bethlehem remains a symbol of hope, one that transcends borders, religions and conflicts.

As we navigate these challenging times, let us reflect on the message of Christmas and strive for a future where the streets of Bethlehem, once again, resound with joyous celebrations of peace and unity.","['israeli', 'muslims', 'jerusalem', 'opinion', 'bethlehem', 'christmas', 'different', 'world', 'gaza', 'peace', 'christians', 'look', 'palestinian']","CNN —The iconic occupied Palestinian territories’ city of Bethlehem will undergo a profound departure this year from its usual jubilant atmosphere.

CNN —

We arrive at Erez Checkpoint. Israeli soldiers thumb through our passports, examine every item in our bags, then wave us through. After a long walk through a barricaded no-man’s land, Palestinian officers register our names and passport numbers, then press us for a list of people we’re planning to meet. Our Palestinian fixer intervenes, reminds the guys with the guns to be nice to us foreigners, and presto: We’re in Gaza. On the list of the three or four people we’re scheduled to see in the course of the day is at least one senior official in Hamas.

Ilene Prusher Jordana Miller

This is a routine I participated in, on and off, for 16 years of my life while reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for the American media throughout the 1990s and 2000s, up until my last trip to Gaza in January 2009 at the end of another Israel-Hamas war that shocked the world and caused needless death and destruction. Later, in 2014, I covered a far deadlier 50-day Israel-Hamas war for TIME magazine, this time from southern Israel, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, mainly because by then I had two toddlers at home and no longer believed entering Gaza was worth the risk.

In nearly every trip I made — and there were too many to count — I met with Hamas officials, like seemingly every good journalist did. Like many others, I was curious to hear their viewpoint and, back when peacemaking was a thing and Israel was turning territory over to the Palestinian Authority, I was keen to understand why they wouldn’t get on board with the land-for-peace deal known as the Oslo Accords.

The Oslo process for dividing the land with Israel to create a zone of Palestinian autonomy — and possibly statehood — had been embraced, at least tepidly, by the late Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). But Hamas, the PLO’s most significant Palestinian rival, was fundamentally opposed to peace with Israel, insisting the only path forward was “armed resistance” aimed at eradicating Israel. Throughout the 1990s, when the peace process was moving forward, Hamas sought to derail it by blowing up Israeli buses and cafes. By the early 2000s, when peacemaking ground to a halt, they had killed hundreds of Israeli civilians in this manner, leading to further separation of Israeli and Palestinian societies.

The Hamas leaders and spokesmen who agreed to our interviews were rarely what you would expect of representatives of a terrorist organization. They were men who were fluent in English, logical-sounding about their grievances and highly educated to boot, usually in engineering or medicine. They portrayed themselves as part of a “political wing” of Hamas, one that was unaware of what was being planned by the more secretive military wing. Often, these spokesman insisted, they had no idea that an attack was imminent.

By and large, we reporters ate it up. Our editors wanted us to have access to this shadowy group and to explain its lure for average Palestinians — and in particular, the strategic challenge it presented to Arafat. By claiming that the organization’s left hand didn’t know what the right hand was doing, Hamas made it easy for themselves to evade tough questions — like, why target civilians rather than military targets? — and convenient for so many of us to feel like we were putting our fingers on the Palestinian pulse rather than sitting down for tea with terrorists.

So we sipped their bitter brews, and they talked a good game. “Look, we take no joy in seeing Israeli civilians get blown up,” one spokesman told me — back in the day when Hamas’ worst weapon was a suicide bomber in an urban area — before going on to insist that these attacks were the only rational answer to what they saw as the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands. When I asked why Hamas wouldn’t take a crack at negotiations instead, they responded that there was no point in talking to Israel — and Israel wasn’t exactly jumping to talk to Hamas either. The spokesman insisted I not use his name with that almost-empathetic quote about not taking joy in killing Israelis. In retrospect, I wonder if he said it because he knew it sounded good to the Western ear.

Hamas played other games with language, presenting themselves as reasonable by saying that its leaders would in theory agree to a long-term hudna, or truce, with Israel. Their words sound nice — who wouldn’t chose a lasting truce over the horrific killing and destruction we are now witnessing? — but the reality was that Hamas would never ink a permanent deal with Israel because, their leaders told me, Islam forbade it.

And then there were the outright distortions. Ahead of October 7, Hamas duped Israel into thinking that the organization was uninterested in inflaming the situation and wanted Gazans’ lives to improve. With that in mind, Israel actually relaxed the Gaza border crossings in late September — a week before the attack — to let more Palestinian laborers into Israel. Sadly, the opening to thousands of additional workers from Gaza turned Israel into an information sieve from which Hamas reportedly gathered intelligence for its attack in October.

Hamas also played fast and loose with facts they gave us reporters. During the first major Israel-Hamas war in 2008 to 2009, known as Operation Cast Lead, Hamas said that fewer than 50 of the 1,400 dead in Gaza had been combatants. But more than a year later, Hamas’ interior minister acknowledged in an interview with the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper that between 600 and 700 of its militants were killed in that war. In that and in almost every war since, Hamas or other militant groups in Gaza launched rockets that fell unintentionally on their own citizens, but rarely if ever, owned up to the error, instead blaming Israel for the deaths.

Yet how often did that stop us from reporting what they told us? That dynamic was on display last month when many mainstream media outlets immediately repeated Hamas’ claim that an Israeli air strike had devastated a hospital and killed a big round figure of 500 Palestinians. More details later emerged, indicating that it was most likely Islamic Jihad, a Hamas rival organization, that had fired an errant missile that landed on the site, and that the casualty count was much lower.

Hospitals once again took center stage in the war when Israel surrounded the Al-Shifa Hospital after claiming that Hamas had operated out of it. Hamas has long denied using hospitals despite proof that they do, and did the same this time even though there is evidence that weapons were found on site and tunnels have been built to allow the organization to use Al-Shifa as a base.

Reporters can feel they have little choice but to rely on Hamas’ numbers and denials because there are few reporters left in Gaza and few options to verify anything independently. But many journalists could be more transparent about how they don’t have independent verification and provide context on how unreliable Hamas has proved to be in the past.

One thing already clear after October 7 is that members of Hamas didn’t sound like they experienced “no joy” in the slaughter of more than 1,200 Israelis and the kidnap of more than 200. Hamas gunmen laughed as they committed the attacks, according to eyewitnesses, and they recorded themselves as they gleefully rampaged through Israeli homes.

Did Hamas change? Or was too much of the media too willing to see them as something other than what they always were?

It’s probably a bit of both. Although founded in 1987 as an expressly Palestinian organization, there is evidence that Hamas has been influenced by the style and brutality of global jihadist groups in general, and ISIS in particular. Still, Hamas’ focus has remained on “the Zionist entity,” not the US, other Western targets or other religions per se. And to the extent there was once a political wing that might have had different aspirations, October 7 left no doubt that the military wing is now the center of Hamas power and strategy.

It’s not as if most of us in the media portrayed Hamas as innocent or moderate. But for years, too many of us treated the group more like an opposition party with occasional violent outbursts than a terrorist organization. In fact, while interning at Reuters at the start of my career in the mid-’90s, I learned that we were never to call Hamas or Islamic Jihad terrorists, only militants. Several outlets maintain that policy even amidst the October 7 massacre, which clearly meets the definition of terror as a deadly attack on civilians for ideological ends.

Journalists working in conflict zones too often pull punches in the interest of appearing neutral, or perhaps to ensure that they stay in the good graces of the gunmen in charge. Many of the questions that now reverberate in my head have no easy answers, but I can say that the ultimate goal for too many of us in the media was to ensure continued access to the big story, not to consider whether the people we were dealing with were good actors or reliable sources. Though it’s important for readers and viewers to hear Palestinian voices as well as those of Israelis, treating Hamas like a legitimate government was perhaps the worst of bothsidesism.

In 2014, a German journalist was heavily criticized for embedding himself with ISIS for a documentary. Trying to explain such a despicable group of murderers went beyond the pale, critics said. Weren’t there some actors whose behavior was so heinous that they didn’t deserve a platform or even so much as a quote, which might only afford them a measure of legitimacy?

Is this the approach we should have taken with Hamas, or ought to moving forward? In an ideal world, yes, but in this dystopian one we’re watching unfold, that may be too much to expect. In the meantime, if journalists continue to interview members of Hamas, we should report their words more critically and not take their comments at face value. We should provide context that notes how unverifiable their information is and how poor their track record for accuracy has been. And we should not shy away from asking ourselves whether our interviews afford them too much legitimacy and give them more of a platform than they deserve.","['israeli', 'traveling', 'hamas', 'organization', 'media', 'opinion', 'israel', 'wing', 'war', 'questions', 'gaza', 'report', 'ask', 'palestinian', 'good']","But Hamas, the PLO’s most significant Palestinian rival, was fundamentally opposed to peace with Israel, insisting the only path forward was “armed resistance” aimed at eradicating Israel.

151,Opinion: A legendary director creates his own ‘Alice in Wonderland’,"Editor’s Note: Noah Berlatsky (@nberlat) is a freelance writer in Chicago. The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

CNN —

The 21st century superhero boom has also been a boom (or booms?) of multiverses. Movies like “Into the Spiderverse,” “Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” “The Flash” and many more are fascinated with the possibility of possibility. What if you hadn’t made that mistake? What if you got bitten by the wrong radioactive spider, or even by a radioactive cat?

Noah Berlatsky Noah Berlatsky

Different worlds may include different evil alter-egos, but they also give you the chance to be someone different, cooler, better. With enough worlds, anyone — everyone! — can be their very best heroic self. Lots of choices give you, and you, and you lots of paths to empowerment.

“The Boy and the Heron,” the latest animated film of legendary Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki, sounds at first like it may be in that empowering multiverse tradition. It’s about a young boy, Mahito Maki (Soma Santoki) who travels to another world to rescue his dead mother.

In this case, though, the alternate reality serves not to open up possibilities, but to close them down. Imagining different outcomes is ultimately a reminder that the only outcome is the one you’re in, the way staring at the double in a mirror is a reminder that, however much you might wish otherwise, you’re still you. That doesn’t make the film a tragedy, exactly. But it does give “The Boy and the Heron” a lyrical weight that sets it apart from even the best of the recent multiverse epics.

Miyazaki is probably the most important Japanese animator of the last 50 years. He’s known for his seamless ability to combine realistic depictions of the natural world with fantastic characters and situations in films like “Princess Mononoke” (1997), “Spirited Away” (2001), and “Howl’s Moving Castle” (2004). He also has an acute sense of tragedy coupled to a hard-won optimism about human possibility; Miyazaki’s worlds are detailed, wondrous and bittersweet.

“The Boy and the Heron” is in the tradition of the director’s best. The movie opens with the night that Mahito’s mother, Hisako, died in a hospital fire in 1943. The next year, Mahito’s father, Shoichi, marries Hisako’s sister Natsuko (Yoshino Kimura), and moves from to her country estate to manage his munitions factory. Mahito is polite to his new mother, but you can see it costs him an effort. He has trouble adjusting to school, gets in fights and strikes himself in the head with a rock so he can stay home.

""The Boy and the Heron"" is a hand-drawn, original story written and directed by the Academy Award-winning Hayao Miyazaki. GKIDS

Mahito also is increasingly irritated by a gray heron that keeps appearing at his window. Eventually, it reveals teeth, and a big-nosed goblin head inside its beak. It tells him his presence is requested … somewhere.

That somewhere turns out to be another world. Natsuko disappears, and the heron taunts Mahito, telling him to rescue her and Mahito’s mother, who the heron says is still alive. Natsuko follows the bird/goblin to a mysterious tower, supposedly built by his great uncle. He enters, and comes out somewhere else, in a world stalked, improbably, by giant flesh-eating parakeets. Also his mother’s elderly maid Kiriko (Ko Shibasaki) is a daring young woman sailor who feeds cute round white blob creatures seafood so they can fly into the stars and become babies in Mahito’s world.

As that description suggests, the other world of “The Boy and the Heron” is more like Alice’s Wonderland than like Marvel’s Earth-41 or Earth-65. The film isn’t mapping out a careful continuity of alternative realities with coherent histories and canon. Instead, it’s tracing the contours of a dream.

A still frame is captured in Academy Award-winning director Hayao Miyazaki's new film. GKIDS

Mayazaki gives even the most surreal set pieces — like a mass pelican attack — a feeling of hyper-real, inevitable beauty. He also has Lewis Carroll’s gift for making nonsense conform to the logic of anxiety. Mahito keeps trying to find Natsuko (or is he trying to find his mother?) even as the world slips its moorings and drifts off on weird tangents. Why do a bunch of stacked blocks control the shape of the world? Why is the king of the parakeets negotiating with Mahito’s great uncle? What’s with the angry stones?

As Carroll knew, and as Miyazaki reminds us, the one alternate world that everyone does visit is the one we find behind our eyelids every night. Dreams can sometimes feel like they open up possibilities. But just as often they’re about disempowerment, as we lose control of memory, emotional response, embodiment, time sense. Nor are dreams an escape in any meaningful sense. You go elsewhere not to change things, but to come back. When you wake up, the real world is still there, with all its losses and stubborn griefs in place.

Mahito’s griefs, in particular, follow him. He resents Natsuko and misses his mother. The trip to another reality offers him the opportunity to fix what went wrong — except of course that it doesn’t, really. One of the film’s most haunting images is of Mahito touching what he thinks is his sleeping mother, only to have the figure dissolve into a viscous liquid, as Mahito steps back and then back again to avoid letting any of it touch his shoes. The new world recapitulates the old, especially in the way it falls apart. All the many doors just lead to the same place; that other alternate world we get to visit besides dream, which is death.

That sounds bleak, and “The Boy and the Heron” is in many ways a sad film, steeped in failure and loss. But Miyazaki has always been a filmmaker of optimism, too. The recognition that this is the one world we’ve got has some bitter in its sweet; it’s this world, after all, in which Mahito’s mother lived, and in which his sibling is going to be born. Part of the allure of dreaming of different possibilities, Miyazaki suggests, is to imagine your way back into the one possibility you have and figure out how to live with it and in it.

“The Boy and the Heron” isn’t empowering except in the sense that it’s about Mahito learning to live with his own limited power — a fate that magic herons, or bows and arrows or a quest can’t really change. The multiverse is just the universe plus regret, denial, hope — the human “power” of wishing things were anything but what and how they are. Miyazaki crawls out of that heron’s throat to lie and say there’s an escape. But it’s a gentle lie, and one that’s part of our one world, too.","['mahito', 'natsuko', 'film', 'alice', 'director', 'mahitos', 'opinion', 'legendary', 'world', 'way', 'creates', 'heron', 'mother', 'wonderland', 'miyazaki', 'boy']","“The Boy and the Heron,” the latest animated film of legendary Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki, sounds at first like it may be in that empowering multiverse tradition.

152,Opinion: Why Aaron Rodgers’ speedy return to football would set a bad precedent,"Editor’s Note: Jalal Baig is a physician and writer based in Chicago whose work has appeared in the Washington Post, NBC News, The Atlantic, Foreign Policy and other publications. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.

CNN —

It’s looking increasingly unlikely that Aaron Rodgers will return to the football field this year, according to news reports this week. And truth be told, that’s probably a good thing.

Last week, the marquee NFL quarterback announced that he was considering a return to the gridiron this season, less than three months after suffering a devastating Achilles tendon rupture minutes into his debut with the New York Jets.

Rodgers is a future Hall of Fame player with access to state-of-the-art medical care and cutting-edge rehab protocols. He is also known to possess a stubborn competitive spirit and a drive to try to achieve on the football field what seems unachievable. It’s no surprise that he would want to attempt an unprecedented recovery after [his] Achilles surgery.

“Anything is possible,” said Rodgers in a recent interview when asked about the prospects of a return to playing this year. “It’s not ‘why try?’, it’s ‘why not?’” he said.

“From September 12 on, my goal was to come back to the practice field and try to play. It was contingent on my health and our team being in position to make a run. That’s why I worked so hard for those 77 days, to get back on the field,” he added.

But reason appears to have won out. In the face of the Jets’ waning playoff fortunes, the four-time NFL MVP appears to have halted his pursuit to return this year in favor of an optimal return for next season.

For medical professionals like myself, there were always serious doubts as to whether Rodgers would be able to overcome the natural limits of human biology and recover from his injury on an accelerated timeline.

The quandary faced by Rodgers is one that many professional athletes confront at some point in their careers when hurt. For them, there will be pressures to return after a major injury that the average patient will never be subjected to.

Rodgers came to the Jets earlier this year after a storied career with the Green Bay Packers, where he was considered key to the team’s ability to contend for the postseason.

But just four plays into the new season, the quarterback was injured during a sack by Buffalo Bills defensive end Leonard Floyd. Two days later, Rodgers underwent an Achilles’ repair surgery by orthopedic surgeon Dr. Neal ElAttrache, who has operated on numerous elite athletes. From the beginning, Rodgers says he was asking his doctor about how fast they could speed his recovery.

“I asked [Dr. ElAttrache] if we could push it, if we could push it beyond the normal protocols. I’ve just wanted to do things quicker, smart, but quicker. It’s just about being smart with the rehab and pushing it as much as I can and then backing off on the days that it doesn’t feel good,” Rodgers said, according to an article published on the Jets’ website.

The part of the body that Dr. ElAttrache was tasked to operate on is crucial for a football player’s success. A 2023 study found that more than 40% of NFL skilled position players do not successfully return to play after rupturing their Achilles tendon.

The Achilles tendon is a band of connective tissue that links calf muscles to the heel. It is the body’s largest tendon and makes an athlete’s explosiveness and essential movements possible.

In order to potentially expedite Rodgers’ recovery, an internal brace — called a SpeedBridge technique — was used to connect the top part of the Achilles tear to the heel bone. The brace consists of a very strong and wide suture tape that spans and mechanically protects the rupture site.

“Before this device was around, you really couldn’t rehab [athletes] incredibly fast because as you rehab, you are putting stress on the repair site. Now, because you are protecting the repair site with the suture, you can actually rehab them sooner,” Dr. Selene Parekh, a professor of orthopedic surgery at Thomas Jefferson University told me, adding that the device can allow an athlete to get “back in the game a little bit quicker.”

One of the first prominent athletes to use the SpeedBridge protocol was running back Cam Akers, who tore his right Achilles tendon prior to the 2021 NFL season. He returned to the Los Angeles Rams less than six months later and in time for the playoffs. While his overall playoff performances were middling with 67 carries for 172 yards, his comeback was achieved far sooner than the usual nine- to 12-month timetable.

But some experts in the field of orthopedics say the SpeedBridge should not be considered a panacea that can circumvent human physiology. The Achilles tendon needs at least five to six months to heal, they say, before it can be safely exposed again to the demands of professional football.

“In orthopedics, we haven’t necessarily found amazing ways to cheat Mother Nature as we like to sometimes think. At the end of the day, there’s no question he [Rodgers] is not as healed now as he would be half a year from now,” Dr. Daniel Guss, a professor of orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School, told me.

“Athletes have superhuman abilities, but not superhuman biology,” Guss said.

A traditional, pocket-passing quarterback like Rodgers may face fewer risks from surgery than a wide receiver or running back, whose style of play requires sharp changes of direction and explosive bursts of speed. But an unhealed tendon always remains vulnerable to catastrophic re-rupturing or to becoming stressed and re-injured.

Apart from these complications, his well-publicized possible return risks setting dangerous precedents for similarly stricken athletes in the future.

If Rodgers can return to quarterback the Jets in less than three months after a grievous injury, other NFL and college and high school players will envision similar recoveries for themselves. And inevitably, these expectations will ripple outside football to other sports.

Of course, there’s no uniform timetable given the manifold considerations — age, position, contractual status, available medical resources, personal aims — surrounding each individual’s comeback from injury.

This is where doctors will have to emphasize to their patients, also eager to speed up the timeline of return from injury, the limited applicability of his story, tantalizing though it may be. The application of advancements in sports medicine must always be tailored to each individual patient’s best interest.

What is clear is that Rodgers’ injury has had a seismic effect on the floundering Jets’ franchise, which remains deeply unsettled at the quarterback position as their season limps to a close.

Die-hard fans may still be clamoring for a Rodgers return to salvage their season, but most of us are glad that it looks like he’ll be taking time to heal. That’s good news for his career going into next year, as well as for the fortunes of his team.","['speedy', 'quarterback', 'athletes', 'aaron', 'precedent', 'opinion', 'injury', 'set', 'achilles', 'tendon', 'field', 'season', 'jets', 'return', 'bad', 'rodgers', 'football']","CNN —It’s looking increasingly unlikely that Aaron Rodgers will return to the football field this year, according to news reports this week.

153,Selena Gomez confirms she’s in a relationship with Benny Blanco,"CNN —

Selena Gomez has confirmed she is dating record producer Benny Blanco.

After an Instagram fan account posted an image of the pair looking cozy on Thursday, the “Only Murders in the Building” actress responded in a series of comments affirming her feelings for Blanco.

“He is my absolute everything in my heart,” Gomez’s comment pinned on the post reads, while another simply says: “LOVE.”

The pop star and actress has recently been working with Blanco on her latest hit, “Single Soon.” They previously collaborated on several songs, including “I Can’t Get Enough” in 2019, which features Blanco dancing in a teddy bear costume in the music video.

An Instagram post on Gomez’s account also shows he was present at her birthday celebrations in July this year.

But not everyone is happy for the former Disney star, leading the 31-year-old to defend Blanco, shooting back at one fan’s comment with: “I don’t understand. If you actually care about me. This is my happiest. If you don’t feel free to say whatever you want. But I will never allow your words to guide my life. Ever. I’m done. If you can’t accept me at my happiest then don’t be in (m)y life at all.”

Some Gomez fans believe Blanco had a dig at her in a 2020 interview promoting “Lonely,” his collaboration with friend and singer Justin Bieber – who is also Gomez’s ex-boyfriend.

“Justin is not one of those, like, cookie-cutter pop artists, you know they’re, like, ‘This is my new single and here’s my makeup line,’” Blanco said, which fans took to be a swipe at Gomez’s cosmetic brand, Rare Beauty, which she founded the previous year.

But Gomez appears not to care about this speculation, telling a fan, “lol yeah and he’s still better than anyone I’ve ever been with. Facts.”

To another, she wrote, “then why has he been the best thing that’s ever happened to me. The end.”","['shes', 'selena', 'confirms', 'gomezs', 'yearbut', 'star', 'relationship', 'benny', 'single', 'post', 'fans', 'gomez', 'blanco', 'dont', 'pop']","CNN —Selena Gomez has confirmed she is dating record producer Benny Blanco.

Derek Hough’s wife Hayley Erbert is recovering after emergency surgery.

The “Dancing with the Stars” judge shared on social media that Erbert, who is also a professional dancer, had fallen ill.

“At the end of last night’s tout performance in Washington, D.C., my wife Hayley became disoriented and was taken to the hospital,” he wrote in a note on Instagram. “She was diagnosed with a cranial hematoma from a burst blood vessel and required an emergency craniectomy.

156,Beyoncé and Taylor Swift have never had the rivalry many try to suggest,"CNN —

Beyoncé vs Taylor Swift is less about them than it is about a larger discussion about erasure and ethnicity.

Both women have been successful performers for decades, endorsing each other’s artistry along the way. But many of their supporters and cultural critics continue to compare their careers, along with how their work is received and acknowledged.

The latest example was the reception this week to Swift being named Time’s 2023 Person of the Year. New York Times bestselling author and cultural critic Luvvie Ajayi Jones noted Beyoncé’s omission from the list of individuals considered.

“Taylor being TIME person of the year while Beyoncé was not even nominated when they had VERY comparable years in terms quantifiable impact is actually wild,” Ajayi Jones wrote on Instagram.

“They both had record-breaking sold out world tours and BOTH shifted economies ad BOTH had documentaries come out,” she continued. “ONE of them was crowned the PERSON OF THE YEAR. While the other was not even considered for the title.”

Swift’s “Eras Tour” reportedly grossed more than an estimated $1 billion, while Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” tour reportedly grossed an estimated $570 million. However, she had 56 tour dates compared to Swift’s 146.

“Whether or not you are BeyHive [the term for her hardcore fans] or can’t stand her, you cannot deny the obvious erasure,” Ajayi Jones added. “Because there is only ONE main thing that makes her and Taylor different. You can be one of the most influential women in the world, and because you’re Black you can still be locked out.”

Other well known people, including journalist Cari Champion, responded with support in Ajayi Jones’ comments on the post.

“When tell you that YOU always have the time and you are ON TIME,” Champion remarked.

TV personality and author Nicole Waters commented, “She’s won everything and still can’t win. We thank God she doesn’t measure her worth by accolades issued by ‘not us.’ And that’s the lesson.”

For some, the selection of Swift is a continuation of the debate about industry disparities between Black and white artists and how their work is valued.

In 2017, there were accusations of racism after Adele topped Beyoncé in the album of the year category at the Grammy awards.

Yet the argument can be made that far from allowing issues of race to hold her back, Beyoncé has used it to fuel her art (see “Lemonade,” “Black Is King” and “Renaissance” for confirmation of that). It also bears mention that while she has not yet won an album of the year Grammy, Beyoncé holds the all-time record for most Grammy wins by a single artist with 32.

So while comparisons between the two artists may continue, the women themselves have only shown each other love.

Taylor Swift pushes back on comparing tours

In her interview with Time, Swift called out those who would position her in competition with Beyoncé.

“There were so many stadium tours this summer, but the only ones that were compared were me and Beyoncé,” Swift said. “Clearly it’s very lucrative for the media and stan culture to pit two women against each other, even when those two artists in question refuse to participate in that discussion.”

She also hailed Bey, saying “She’s the most precious gem of a person — warm and open and funny.”

“And she’s such a great disrupter of music-industry norms,” Swift said. “She taught every artist how to flip the table and challenge archaic business practices.”

Concert films

Both artists recently released films documenting their tours and attended the film premieres for the other.

In October, Swift gushed about Beyoncé showing up for the premiere for her “Eras Tour” concert film in Los Angeles.

“I’m so glad I’ll never know what my life would’ve been like without @beyonce’s influence. The way she’s taught me and every artist out here to break rules and defy industry norms,” Swift wrote in the caption of a video posted on social media showing the two of them inside of the theater. “Her generosity of spirit. Her resilience and versatility. She’s been a guiding light throughout my career and the fact that she showed up tonight was like an actual fairytale.”

Swift returned the gesture the following month, when Beyoncé’s film premiered in London.

Beyoncé literally gives Swift her flowers

In 2021, both women had a big night at the Grammys.

Swift won album of the year for “Folklore” and Beyoncé notched her 28th Grammy, becoming the most Grammy-winning female artist of all time.

The latter sent the former a beautiful bouquet of flowers with a note that read, “Congratulations on your Grammy. It was great seeing you on Sunday night. Thank you for always being so supportive. Sending love to you and your family. B.”

Swift shared a photo of the flowers and note on social media writing, “Woke up to flowers from the queen of grace & greatness @beyonce and suddenly it’s the best Friday EVER. Thank you B and congratulations on your epic achievement Sunday night!!”

Beyoncé shares the stage with Swift

Kanye West leaping on stage to hijack Swift’s win for best female video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards has gone down in pop culture history.

West grabbed the microphone and said, “Yo Taylor, I’m really happy for you. Imma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!”

The camera panned to Bey in the audience, looking flabbergasted.

Later, when Bey’s “Single Ladies” won for video of the year she brought Swift out to have the moment she had earlier been denied.

“I remember being 17 years old up for my first MTV Award with Destiny’s Child and it was one of the most exciting moments in my life,” Beyoncé said. “So I’d lke for Taylor to come out and have her moment.”

Afterwards Swift had nothing but praise for what she had done.

“They told me to stand by the side of the stage and I didn’t really know what was going to go down, but I thought it was so wonderful and gracious of her to do what she’s always done,” Rolling Stone reported Swift as saying at the time. “She’s always been a great person before anything else. Before the talented artist, the superstar, she’s always been a great person and I just, I thought I couldn’t love Beyoncé more tonight, then tonight happened and it was just wonderful.”

That love clearly couldn’t be more mutual.","['suggest', 'shes', 'artist', 'try', 'tour', 'women', 'taylor', 'beyoncé', 'grammy', 'won', 'person', 'swift', 'rivalry']","CNN —Beyoncé vs Taylor Swift is less about them than it is about a larger discussion about erasure and ethnicity.

157,Mariah Carey sends Brenda Lee flowers for holiday chart topping hit,"CNN —

The Queen of Christmas has no problem giving another holiday star her flowers.

Mariah Carey is celebrating Brenda Lee’s Christmas classic, “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart, 65 years after the song’s initial debut.

Lee posted a photo on her Instagram stories of the flowers Carey sent her, along with a card that read: “Dearest Ms. Brenda, congratulations on your historic No. 1. Have a Merry Christmas. Love, Mariah.”

Lee wrote on the photo: “Thank you for your sweet note, @mariahcarey! Wishing you the merriest Christmas, too!” and included the audio of Carey’s hit, “All I Want For Christmas Is You.”

Carey’s song has topped the charts for the holiday season the past four years with Lee’s song peaking at No. 2 behind it, according to Billboard.

Lee was just 13 when she recorded “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” and it debuted to modest acclaim in 1958.

Since then, the tune has become a mainstay for the season and is Lee’s signature hit.

“I’m happy for everybody here that’s worked so hard to make this happen because in today’s world, everything moves so fast and furious,” Lee told Billboard when it hit no. 1. “But I’m telling you this: My label has come to bat.”

Carey’s song is No. 2 behind Lee’s.

158,Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were not ‘psychotic’ enough to publicly ‘hard launch’ a first date,"CNN —

Taylor Swift is clearing a few things up related to the much-debated timeline of her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.

In an interview with Time Magazine published Wednesday – wherein Swift was named the outlet’s 2023 “Person of the Year” – she said her relationship with Kelce actually started earlier this summer when he “very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell.”

She was referring to a July episode of Kelce’s podcast “New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce,” which he co-hosts with his brother, where he revealed that he attempted to give Swift his phone number by way of a friendship bracelet during one of her concerts.

According to the “Anti-Hero” singer this week, they quietly “started hanging out” right after that.

“By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple,” she told Time in this week’s interview, referring to the Chiefs game where she was first seen in person in September.

“I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game?” she pondered, going on to assert that they “would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.”

Since that September game, Swift has attended a total of five of Kelce’s football games, and they made cameos on “Saturday Night Live” in October. Kelce also flew down to Argentina last month to catch his second “Eras Tour” concert.

Acknowledging the public nature of the relationship in Wednesday’s interview, Swift says they’re not trying to hide anything at this point.

“I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” she said. “We’re just proud of each other.”","['date', 'travis', 'kelce', 'think', 'podcast', 'taylor', 'referring', 'game', 'launch', 'publicly', 'hard', 'interview', 'relationship', 'started', 'psychotic', 'swift']","CNN —Taylor Swift is clearing a few things up related to the much-debated timeline of her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.

159,Meryl Streep nearly wasn’t cast in ‘The Devil Wears Prada’ because some people thought she wasn’t funny,"CNN —

It’s now virtually impossible to imagine “The Devil Wears Prada” without Meryl Streep’s bravura portrayal of icy fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly, but the three-time Oscar winner almost didn’t land the part, the movie’s producer, Wendy Finerman, told the “Hollywood Gold” podcast.

“And Meryl, people thought we were crazy. I mean, I had people call me up and say, ‘Are you out of your mind? She’s never been funny a day in her life,’” Finerman told podcast host Daniela Taplin Lundberg in an episode released on Wednesday.

“She has been funny and they were wrong but this was clearly a different kind of role for her,” Finerman added, while Lundberg recalled Streep’s more comic performances in “She-Devil” and “Death Becomes Her.”

Before 2006, when “The Devil Wears Prada” was released, Streep was acclaimed as a predominantly dramatic actress, known for her Oscar-winning performances in “Sophie’s Choice” and “Kramer vs. Kramer.”

She eventually received yet another Oscar nomination for her performance as Miranda Priestly, the editor who inspires terror in her employees, including her assistants, played by Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt.

The character, first created by Lauren Weisberger in her 2003 novel of the same name, is widely acknowledged to have been inspired by Vogue editor Anna Wintour.

“I think that (casting Streep) was part of the fun of the unexpected,” Finerman added, before recalling the process of working with the legendary actress and visiting her house with binders filled with ideas for the film.

“(Streep) calls me and says ‘Wendy, what else do you have? Where’s the whole thing?’ She’s amazing,” Finerman said.

160,"This US bought a house in France for $20,000 without seeing it","CNN —

Her fascination with France began when she spent a summer in the European country while working as an au pair back back in the 1970s.

From then on, Ellen, originally from the East Coast of the US, made it her mission to travel to France whenever she got the chance to.

She met her now husband Joseph, from the West Coast, in the late 1970s and the couple went on to marry and have three children, continuing to travel to the country as a family once every two years or so.

“It’s funny, Joseph and our daughter would tease me, because anytime we were planning a vacation, I always wanted to come to France,” Ellen admits.

“They liked France too, but they would say, ‘Can we go somewhere else?’ [I would say,] ‘Yes, as long as we stop in Paris first or something like that.’ So, it was a compromise usually.”

‘Half house’

Ellen and her husband Joseph came across a rundown home in the historic village of Lonlay l'Abbaye in Normandy and purchased it unseen. Ellen and Joseph A.

Although Ellen and Joseph, who have chosen not to disclose their surname, had been toying with the prospect of moving to France for years, it wasn’t until they were both approaching retirement age that they began seriously thinking about buying a property there.

Ellen came across a tiny rundown home in the historic village of Lonlay l’Abbaye in Normandy, northern France, while browsing French real estate online, back in 2014.

“The house was affordable,” says Joseph, who previously worked as a business executive. “It was obviously a bit of a ruin. But it was within our budget.

“And that was always foremost in our minds. What can we budget? How much should we plan to spend on improvements, and so on and so forth. So, the budgetary element was pretty important for us.”

They then spent some time checking out the “charming” village on Google Street View, and eventually came across an account of two American soldiers who’d been “helped by the French Resistance in the village during World War II.”

The couple made the decision to purchase the house, which has around 400 square meters of living space, unseen, arranging for an inspector to view it beforehand.

While the property was on the market for around 18,000 euros ($19,400), Ellen and Joseph ended up purchasing it for around 13,000 euros following negotiations with the seller.

“It really wasn’t in move-in condition at all,” says Ellen, explaining that the house would need extensive work to make it liveable again. “The seller kind of agreed with that.”

Once the sale was finalized, they brought in local builders to begin demolition work on the property, overseeing things from their California home.

“They kept us informed. They would send us photographs to show us how the work was progressing,” explains Joseph. “And we would exchange ideas on how the renovation should unfold. So it worked out ok.”

The couple continued to travel to France regularly, flying over in 2015 and 2016 and checking on the progress of the work.

The following year they decided it was finally time to start the process of packing up their lives in the US and moving to France.

The first big step was applying for a long stay visa, which took a few months to finalize, then came what Joseph describes as the “wind down procedure.”

“Prior to your departure, there’s the decision to leave your homeland to go to another country, and all of the implications associated with that decision,” he notes. “All the preparation that has to be done in advance.”

They sold off many of their possessions, keeping only items of sentimental value, and set things in motion so that they could manage their affairs from France.

Big move

They completed extensive renovation work on the home over a period of nearly seven years, replacing the floors and walls, as well as the electrics and plumbing. Ellen and Joseph A.

Ellen and Joseph, who also have a property in New York, decided to rent out their home in California rather than sell it.

They then set about renting an apartment in Paris as their base while work on their Normandy home continued.

“We found that, to be in the parts of Paris that we wanted to live in, it was much less expensive to rent than it would have been to buy,” explains Ellen.

“Plus, the older that you are, the more difficult it is to get a mortgage. We would have had to have sold up and probably bought cash in Paris.”

They arrived in Paris to begin their new lives in April 2017.

Ellen and Joseph quickly set about getting to know their new community, while also traveling back and forth to Lonlay l’Abbaye to check on the renovation work.

“Each year, we budgeted for a different phase of renovation,” says Ellen, before describing how they replaced the floors, walls, electrics, and the plumbing in the home.

“We sought out good building materials and learned about ventilation and humidity issues in old stone houses.”

Ellen goes on to point out that they were able to keep the original staircase inside the house, along with a wooden cabinet that had been in the study.

While they had no choice but to get new windows and doors, they opted to replace them with replicas.

“We like to think that the ghosts of the American GIs who helped to liberate this village would still recognize our house if they walked past it on the street,” she adds.

Their goal was to both transform the tiny house into a liveable second home, and “restore it and leave it in good authentic condition for future generations.”

“We wanted to keep it looking the way it was,” says Ellen. “We didn’t want to make any big changes.”

Renovation project

""We're extremely proud of the builders, who managed to transform this from basically a small country ruin to a very liveable place,"" says Joseph. Ellen and Joseph A.

She points out that any major changes to the outside of our Normandy house had to be approved by the local authorities and the Architectes de Batiments de France, officials concerned with protecting monuments and historic areas, due to the house’s proximity to the village’s 11th century abbey.

But as the work continued to progress, the global pandemic hit, which led to renovations being halted for around two years and they were unable to travel to Normandy to visit.

Thankfully, Ellen and Joseph were able to resume work on the home once restrictions were lifted and had completed the structural work and painting by December 2021. Their new windows were installed a year later.

“We’re extremely proud of the builders, who managed to transform this from basically a small country ruin to a very liveable place,” says Joseph, adding that they’re still working on the furnishing and the “decorative side of” things.

They’d also eventually like to finish off the attic, which is currently used as storage space, and perhaps add a “half bath” up there.

Ellen and Joseph estimate that they spent a total of 65,000 euros (about $70,000) on the building works and labor, and a further 5,000 euros on appliances and furniture.

Now settled in France, they continue to flit back and forth between Paris and Lonlay l’Abbaye, stressing that they wouldn’t have it any other way.

“It’s kind of like a French Brigadoon,” Joseph says of Lonlay l’Abbaye. “There’s a certain magic to the village. The history. The Abbey. And everything is just so close. You’re surrounded by these small hills with trees and grass.

“It’s really a dramatic departure from living in a city like Los Angeles, New York or Paris.”

They’ve formed strong friendships in Lonlay l’Abbaye and travel there by train “every five or six weeks,” staying at their “half house” for a few weeks, before heading back to their rented apartment in Paris.

According to Joseph, the journey between the properties is a little over two and a half hours – their home is a 20-minute taxi ride from Flers station in Normandy.

Both feel that life in France has done wonders for them, explaining that they walk a lot more, and eat much better due to the readily available fresh produce.

“Our daughter thinks that we’ve definitely extended our lifespans by moving here,” says Ellen.

“It just seems like a much healthier lifestyle for us.”

Early on, they decided to “shoulder the responsibility” of learning French to make the transition easier, and stress that this has helped tremendously when it comes to forming bonds.

“Now 90% of all speaking that we do is in French,” says Joseph. “Even though we are far from proficient in French, it’s just something that really, really matters to us. And of course, it makes a difference to other people as well.”

However, the couple admit that they still occasionally find it daunting while attending a dinner with only French speakers who want to discuss philosophy.”

They’ve had to adapt to some of the cultural differences between the French and Americans, and say that some have been easier to get used to than the others.

For instance, Joseph points out that the French are “very, very private” in comparison to Americans, and perhaps less willing to share their lives.

“They don’t invite you to their home right away,” he notes. “They don’t address you in the first person.

“And that’s in contrast to the United States, where people are much more open with each other.”

However, Ellen acknowledges that she’s always been “more comfortable with the French frame of mind” when it comes to relating to people and forming friendships, so this has suited her fine.

“Maybe I’m just a little more introverted,” she notes.

The couple, who chronicled the renovation in an online blog, have found life in France to be more affordable than in the US, noting that their health care costs and property taxes are considerably less now.

In fact, they say the latter is roughly five to six times more on their properties in the States.

“I think that’s one reason why a lot of Americans are thinking of Europe,” says Joseph. “Because of the cost of living, and the property taxes, but also the health care.”

While they both miss living in southern California, neither has any regrets about leaving, admitting that it had become quite draining for them towards the end.

“The traffic. The craziness. And then, to some extent, politically. The divisions in the US were very stressful,” says Ellen.

“It’s not like we were having daily battles with people. But it was hard to watch. It’s still hard to watch the press from overseas and see how divided America is.

“Gee, it doesn’t feel like the America we grew up in anymore.”

They’ve gotten to explore much of France during their time there and have been enjoying learning about the different regions.

“We fully appreciate how much the French enjoy and appreciate the seasons, the moments and the food,” says Ellen. “It’s a different cultural thing, but it’s something you can appreciate.”

They say that they’d advise anyone considering a similar move to research their chosen destination carefully and refrain from trying to “replicate America” wherever they go.

“Leave some of those expectations behind,” says Ellen. “Because you don’t want to just beat your head against a brick wall, and insist on thinking like an American. Saying ‘well, this should be easy, and they should do it this way.’”

They acknowledge that spending so much time in France beforehand made things easier for them, stressing that things may have turned out differently if they had been less familiar with the country.

“We have encountered that with some friends,” says Joseph. “You [can] get some real culture clash.”

Ellen and Joseph currently have no plans to buy a place in Paris and say they’ll continue to move between their apartment in the 7th arrondissement and the countryside, perhaps spending eight months in Paris and four months in Lonlay l’Abbaye in the future.

“It’s kind of an ideal situation where you have a place to get away to. To enjoy everything that Paris has to offer, but then to also get a break from the noise and the business.”

Although they’ve returned to the US to spend time with their family and friends since relocating, they have no intention of returning to the country to live at this point, and can see themselves remaining in France for the rest of their lives.

“There are moments, of course, when we do miss a place, or something from the United States,” says Joseph.

“But this is a way of life. We’re trying to be Americans enjoying France and living here compatibly with the country.

No one was injured during Sunday’s incident, but at least one of the tourists lost a cellphone in the mishap, which occurred while the gondolier was trying to maneuver under a low bridge, police said.

There was no damage to the gondola but its upholstered chairs and blankets were thrown into the canal, a spokesman for the city’s gondola association told CNN Thursday.

He confirmed that the gondolier had instructed the tourists not to move around or stand up to take selfies during the maneuver, but due to a language barrier, the tourists did not comply.

The association recently limited the number of riders on gondolas from six to five, with the maximum weight per rider capped at 230 pounds.

There are currently 430 licensed gondoliers in Venice who work in shifts to accommodate tourists. The trade is often passed down from fathers to sons. There is currently only one licensed female gondolier.

Badly behaved tourists have been an issue in recent years, with notable episodes including a man who dived into the canal from a three-story building and others fined for swimming in the water.

Meanwhile, back in May, authorities launched an investigation after a mysterious green blob turned the canal fluorescent green. They discovered that a chemical had been dumped in the water, but it is not known how it came to be there.

Next year, Venice will institute an entrance fee for day trippers to the city to combat over-tourism.","['canal', 'water', 'licensed', 'green', 'venice', 'stand', 'currently', 'gondola', 'selfies', 'capsizes', 'tourists', 'gondolier', 'maneuver']","CNN —A group of Chinese tourists landed in cold water in Venice after the gondola they were in flipped over while they were standing up to take selfies.

162,National scenic trails: These three US trails are now national parks,"CNN —

Three scenic trails in the northern United States have new status as National Park System sites.

The Ice Age, New England and North Country national scenic trails were previously administered by the National Park Service as part of the National Trails System.

They’re now part of the National Park System, bringing the total number of units from 425 to 428, according to an NPS news release. The system includes more than 25 naming designations, including national scenic trail, national seashore, national monument and so on. The 400-plus sites are commonly referred to as “parks.” There are 63 sites with “national park” in their name – blockbusters such as Grand Canyon National Park and Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

The new scenic trail designations double the number of sites in that category from three to six. The trails join the Appalachian, Natchez Trace, and Potomac Heritage trails.

“The new status for the Ice Age, New England, and North Country national scenic trails will increase public awareness and use of these amazing pathways,” said National Park Service Director Chuck Sams, in a statement. “Their combined 5,500-plus miles travel through parts of 10 states and hundreds of communities, from large cities to rural towns, providing countless close-to-home opportunities for people to easily access green space and enjoy the benefits of outdoor recreation.”

The Ice Age National Scenic Trail stretches nearly 1,200 miles in Wisconsin in a landscape of rolling hills and ridges, lakes and river valleys — “reminders that just 15,000 years ago, during the Ice Age, much of North America lay under a huge glacier,” NPS says in the news release.

In Connecticut and Massachusetts, the New England National Scenic Trail extends 235 miles from the shores of Long Island Sound to mountain summits.

The North Country National Scenic Trail is still in progress and is expected to be a 4,600-mile continuous path when it’s finished, traversing parts of eight states: Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Wisconsin.","['park', 'trail', 'age', 'states', 'trails', 'ice', 'national', 'country', 'parks', 'scenic', 'north']","CNN —Three scenic trails in the northern United States have new status as National Park System sites.

163,Ski resorts that are good bets for snowy slopes this season,"CNN —

Skiers, take note.

Less snow is falling worldwide, according to analysis of data gathered since 1973 by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. The Northern Hemisphere’s middle latitudes (the area north of the tropics and south of the Arctic) are seeing the most notable decline.

Last winter, ski resorts in places such as Austria, Vermont, Switzerland and Spain’s Sierra Nevada region had unexpected closures because of unseasonably warm winter temperatures.

“In the United States, winters are now 2.3°F milder than a century ago,” said Bob Henson, a meteorologist and journalist with Yale Climate Connections. “Although heat waves are a huge risk with summer warming, winters are warming even more dramatically than summers in many areas,” he said.

In some ski areas, the effect has been drastic.

Once the world’s highest ski resort at over 17,000 feet (5,180 meters), Bolivia’s Chacaltaya now sits abandoned after a glacier melted away. And a small ski area in Le Sambuy, France, recently closed for good because of a lack of snow.

“The world’s warming winters are especially devastating for ski areas at lower elevations or in other settings that are just barely warm enough,” Henson said.

Planning a ski vacation requires some careful consideration for optimal conditions.

“As a general rule, the highest-altitude resorts – including several in the Colorado Rockies and the Western Alps – will have the most reliably cold weather and the longest snow seasons, since they’re less dependent on periodic Arctic intrusions in order to stay cold enough for snow,” said Henson.

And while high-altitude areas can suffer from prolonged dry periods, the ability to make snow can lessen the impact on ski conditions, he said. However, snowmaking has a “substantial carbon footprint,” he pointed out.

Managing ‘snow-sure’ expectations

As with any especially weather-dependent trip, balancing priorities can be tricky.

“We are really careful about what we say to clients when they ask for snow-sure resorts,” said Sarah Plaskitt of ski travel website Scout Ski.

“Everyone always wants village charm and high altitude and ski-in, ski-out. But charm comes from being old and traditional, and they didn’t build villages right up in the high-altitude slopes hundreds of years ago, nor did they design those villages around ski resorts.”

It’s easy to obsess about snow before you arrive. All that matters is what the snow is like the moment you are putting on your boots. Sarah Plaskitt of Scout Ski

Plaskett recommends places such as Zermatt, Val d’Isère and Méribel – popular ski resort towns in Switzerland and France – that have charming villages as well as access to higher-altitude slopes.

“It’s easy to obsess about snow before you arrive,” she said, and for some people, that obsession starts months in advance of a trip.

“All that matters is what the snow is like the moment you are putting on your boots,” she said. “Even if the snow is really bad, we rarely get complaints as everyone just ends up having a great time anyway.”

From Europe and Japan to Alaska and Utah, read on for some of the highest likelihoods for snowy slopes for a ski vacation this winter. (Just keep in mind that great snowfalls in previous years don’t 100% guarantee great snow this season.)

Alyeska Ski Area, Alaska

The ski season usually runs from late November to late-April at Alaska’s largest ski resort, Alyeska, located just 45 minutes from Anchorage in the Chugach Mountains and the resort town of Girdwood.

The slopes here – including what’s billed as the longest continuous double black diamond ski run in North America, on the resort’s North Face – see an average of 382 inches (about 970 centimeters) of annual snowfall, lending new meaning to steep and deep.

And the best news for skiers who suffer from altitude sickness? You’re only 2,300 feet (about 700 meters) above sea level where the cable car drops you at the top of Mount Alyeska, which means you can score all the big mountain ski thrills and powder without the potential altitude effects that can be an issue at much higher resorts.

Zermatt, Switzerland

The Swiss mountain town known for the Matterhorn is one of the biggest ski areas in the world and has the highest cable car station in all of Europe, too, at over 12,700 feet (about 3,870 meters).

You can usually ski year round in Zermatt atop a glacier at Matterhorn Glacier Paradise, where 13 miles (21.1 kilometers) of groomed runs offer views spanning some of France, Italy and Switzerland’s highest mountains in addition to the Matterhorn’s iconic peak.

Zermatt’s car-free village does alpine charm in a big way, especially when you’re staying at central spots such as the grande dame hotel Mont Cervin Palace, open since 1852, or the stylish Schweizerhof, both just steps from the town’s cable car and train station.

Whitewater Ski Resort, British Columbia, Canada

Ski resorts in Whistler and Banff are no slouches in the snow department. But don’t overlook Whitewater Ski Resort along Canada’s Powder Highway in the Selkirk Mountains of British Columbia, which sees some of Canada’s snowiest skiing conditions, too.

The resort gets roughly 222 inches (about 564 centimeters) of annual snowfall, according to OntheSnow.com, across more than 3,200 acres of total skiing terrain with a season that usually runs from December into April.

Stay close to the mountain at the affordable Alpine Inn & Suites (rates start around $90 per night, converted from CAD to USD) in the artsy mountain town of Nelson, which claims to have more restaurants per capita than foodie hot spots such as Vancouver and San Francisco.

Val Thorens, France

Part of the 3 Vallées (the largest connected ski area in the world), France’s Val Thorens takes the title of the highest ski resort in Europe, at an elevation of over 7,500 feet (about 2,285 meters).

The slopes here usually stay open well into May, with an average snowfall of more than 201 inches (about 510 centimeters) and over 90 miles (145 kilometers) of runs to schuss down.

You can take some of the stress out of all the moving parts of a ski trip by making it an all-inclusive vacation when you stay at Club Med Val Thorens Sensations, where kids 3 and younger stay free and your ski pass, group lessons and meals and drinks are all wrapped into the price.

Hokkaido, Japan

A popular destination for keen Australian skiers and other intrepid powder hounds from Japan and abroad, Hokkaido island usually gets about a whopping 1,500 centimeters (590 inches) of snow a year thanks to Siberian winds that lash the region with light and dry powder.

It makes for predictably epic ski conditions at spots such as Hanazono Niseko and Rusutsu, to name just a couple of Hokkaido’s over 100 ski resorts.

You’re not doing skiing in Japan correctly, of course, if you’re not spending time recuperating from the slopes in an onsen. One of Hokkaido’s best hot springs can be found south of Niseko and Rusutsu at Noboribetsu, a historical spa town known for its mineral-rich waters.

Alta, Utah

Last ski season, 13 of 15 Utah ski resorts broke all-time records for snowfall. But the fairest among them might be Alta Ski Area, just a 45-minute drive southeast of Salt Lake City in Utah’s Wasatch Mountains and consistently ranked among North America’s top ski resorts for snowfall, with an average of 352 inches (about 894 centimeters) accumulating annually, according to OntheSnow.com.

Alta’s 2022/2023 season was the resort’s snowiest on record, with 903 inches (2,294 centimeters) of the white stuff.

South Lake Tahoe saw its snowiest season on record last year, with Kirkwood Mountain Resort leading the resort pack with more than 700 inches of snow (1,778 centimeters).

It was an unusually epic season for the mountain, to be sure (although average snowfall at Kirkwood is a none-too-shabby 343 inches – about 871 centimeters). But the resort’s high base elevation of 7,800 feet (about 2,375 meters) — and its peak elevation of 9,800 feet (nearly 3,000 meters) — make it a reliable, snowy favorite for skiing in the Sierra Nevada.

Wolf Creek Ski Area, Colorado

Breckenridge, Aspen, Steamboat and Vail often take the spotlight in Colorado. But for the ski resort that’s often the snowiest in the state, head to Southwest Colorado and Wolf Creek Ski Area, where OntheSnow’s figure for average annual snowfall stacks up at 319 inches or 810 centimeters (compared to an average of 234 inches in Vail).

You can stay on the mountain, just a few miles from the slopes, at the no-frills Wolf Creek Ranch Ski Lodge, where rooms and cabins with full kitchens start from around $200 per night.

The outdoorsy town of South Fork, along the Rio Grande River about 19 miles away from the ski resort, is a good base for snowmobiling trips into the surrounding Rio Grande National Forest and has breweries, pizzerias and barbecue joints for low-key, après-ski fun.

164,Step inside this immersive installation aimed at altering your perception,"CNN —

Imagine relinquishing all sense of space and self — standing inside an area of stark darkness, interrupted by endless grids of light, and punctuated throughout by rising and falling acoustic tones, altering depth perception and consciousness.

No longer left to the imagination, that experience is possible by stepping inside an infinity illusion called “Light High.” Using thousands of LEDs and mirrors, water and sounds, German artist and spatial designer Jacqueline Hen’s award-winning installation aims to explore the glitch between analog and digital.

“It almost feels like entering the Matrix,” Hen said of her walk-in artwork, which she is featuring at the annual Amsterdam Light Festival, where more than 20 exhibits are lighting up the famed canals of the city until January 21, 2024.

“Light lets you create new realities within a space,” Hen told CNN ahead of the light festival. “For me, it’s very interesting to experiment and investigate the perception of reality and also the proprioception, so perception of body in space.”

Creating the 60-square-meter (646-square-foot) installation was no easy task, she added.

“Everything needs to be built really precisely (and) leveled perfectly because if the mirrors are (even just) one millimeter off, it wouldn’t work,” Hen said. “It needs to be perfect.”

She added that while she enjoys the whole process of preparing the electronics and welding, it can sometimes get quite repetitive, describing it as “thousands of steps until you reach the final artwork.”

Light as a portal to another world

The Cologne-based artist and spatial designer is known for creating light-based immersive art experiences. Last year in Switzerland, she exhibited “Formation of the Sun” at the Grindelwald Light Art Festival.

The installation featured a 17-meter (56-foot) golden inflatable sphere made with holographic foil and filled with haze and sounds. It is punctured by two strong light beams that collide in the center of the work, and shattered throughout the space by mirrored artifacts, as if “the light is bending the space to its gravitational center,” Hen said.

The collision theory of how the galaxy was created served as her inspiration, she said, adding “I tried to create this immersive and also emotional space that somehow blurs the boundaries between mythical and scientific thinking.”

Another recent work featured human performers as part of the installation in Dortmund, Germany. Titled “Sympoiesis,” it had “futuristic beekeepers” interacting, examining and distributing thousands of tiny lights meant to resemble insects.

“This work was about the overlay of performance and everyday life to create alternate realities,” she said.

The artist says her thought process first begins with sensory perception of a space, and how people would move through it, and then the concept and techniques flow from there.

While Hen said she never actively sought out a career as a light artist, she’s always been fascinated by all kinds of light. While in university, she started experimenting with the medium. Today, she is fostering the next generation of designers as a professor for artistic experimental design basics at RheinMain University of Applied Sciences in Wiesbaden, Germany.

“It’s a big responsibility to create an environment where the students feel free to experiment, discuss, question the status quo, and feel safe expressing their thoughts,” Hen said.

She hopes her work will continue to foster a sense of altered perception and allow people to “defer from (their) every day.”","['hen', 'aimed', 'artist', 'thousands', 'installation', 'immersive', 'jacqueline', 'step', 'altering', 'light', 'work', 'inside', 'space', 'create', 'perception']","Hen won the International Light Art Award for her Matrix-like installation, “Light High,” shown here.

165,Tencent Helix: Chinese tech firm’s vast new campus unveiled,"CNN —

The architects behind Chinese tech giant Tencent’s vast new campus unveiled their plans for the site on Thursday, describing their helix-inspired centerpiece as the “headquarters of the future.”

Set to accomodate over 23,000 employees across nearly 500,000 square meters (5.38 million square feet), the campus will be almost twice the size of Apple’s California headquarters when it opens in five years’ time.

Digital renderings of the design, shared exclusively with CNN by architects Büro Ole Scheeren, show four towers spiraling out from an open central space dubbed the “Vortex Incubator.” The landmark structure will become the focal point of an ambitious — and largely car-free — “future city” being built by Tencent, owner of messaging services WeChat and QQ, in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.

Speaking to CNN via video call, the architecture firm’s founder, Ole Scheeren, said his building’s “swirling vortex geometry” will create an “ecosystem where everything comes together, where work merges into a very collaborative interactive environment.”

A central area dubbed the ""Vortex Incubator"" will sit at the heart of the campus. Buro-OS

The German architect’s vision was chosen by Tencent, China’s most valuable publicly traded company, following an international design competition.

The lower floors of the scheme, which is named Tencent Helix, connect the office towers via a large lobby and communal educational, recreational, sports and fitness facilities, including basketball, tennis and badminton courts. At ground level, restaurants and shops will erode the distinction between public and private space

This layout means that the building “doesn’t have a front and a back,” said Scheeren, who is known for co-designing Beijing’s famous CCTV Headquarters. He added that the structure’s appearance will vary depending on which angle it is viewed from: “It remains very recognizable, but it changes quite a lot in a subtle way.”

City within in a city

First unveiled by Tencent in 2020, the wider neighborhood — previously known as “Net City” — is being built on a stretch of reclaimed land jutting out into the Pearl River estuary. It will connect to the rest of Shenzhen via ferries and the city’s subway system. (And although the district is “predominantly car free,” Scheeren said, employees will be able to access Tencent’s headquarters via road bridges linking to parking spaces and drop-off points.)

The technology firm’s headquarters will be one of dozens of structures, including schools and public amenities, on the site. While some of the buildings are already under construction, others have not yet had their designs unveiled.

An aerial view of the plan shows pedestrian pathways spiraling out into the surrounding neighborhood. Buro-OS

To create a sense of cohesion between the new headquarters and its surroundings, Scheeren’s helix motif — which he said evoked galaxies and bands of cloud around the eye of a storm — will extend into a network of pedestrian pathways spiraling out from the centerpiece structure. The new master plan also includes an undulating path that Scheeren said may look “something like a High Line 2.0.”

“I found a way, without changing any of the existing buildings, to strategically engage them through a pedestrian network and landscaping — and, in a way, to use the public space as a means to tie the whole master plan together,” he added.

Reimagining ‘gimmicky’ corporate campuses

The German architect stressed that incorporating nature into his design would offer “connection to outdoor space … but at the same time remain a really functional workspace.”

The building will be orientated to benefit from natural ventilation, while a “sponge city” concept — whereby rain is absorbed or captured to protect against storm surges or for use in irrigation — will be employed to reduce water waste.

Despite Tencent Helix’s huge floor area, its relatively compact shape sets it apart from many sprawling US tech campuses, which Scheeren described as being “suburban” in design. “I wanted to create something that is more urban,” he said.

The architect added that corporate campuses has become “gimmicky,” and that he favored offices that “recognize you as a serious worker and not somebody who’s just hanging around on a beanbag the entire day.”

“The office is no longer just a cubicle — but it’s also not a children’s playground,” he said, adding that “to create environments that implicitly tell you can never leave is also a highly problematic approach.”

Tencent Helix is expected to open in time for the technology firm’s 30th anniversary in 2028 and will replace the company’s main Shenzhen office as its global headquarters.","['tech', 'vortex', 'city', 'chinese', 'scheeren', 'tencent', 'space', 'create', 'firms', 'spiraling', 'campus', 'helix', 'public', 'vast', 'headquarters', 'design', 'unveiled']","Buro-OSThe German architect’s vision was chosen by Tencent, China’s most valuable publicly traded company, following an international design competition.

167,"Rembrandt painting once valued at $15,000 sells for almost $14 million at Sotheby’s auction","Editor’s Note: This article was updated with the final sale price and other details following the auction’s conclusion.

London CNN —

A painting valued at $15,000 just two years ago fetched almost £11 million ($13.8 million) at a Sotheby’s auction on Wednesday after being identified as the work of the Dutch master Rembrandt.

“Adoration of the Kings” had been virtually unseen since the 1950s, when it first came to light. It was acquired by collector J.C.H. Heldring in Amsterdam in 1955. His widow sold it to a German family in 1985, where it remained until it was sold by Christie’s in Amsterdam two years ago.

At the time of that sale, Christie’s attributed the biblical scene to the “Circle of Rembrandt,” suggesting it had been carried out by a student or an artist close to the famous painter, and estimated its value at between €10,000 and €15,000 (then around $10,600 to $15,900).

Extensive tests revealed changes that Rembrandt had made to the painting. Sotheby's

The monochromatic painting, which measures 9.6 x 7.3 inches, was purchased by an anonymous buyer for €860,000 (then around $910,000) at the Christie’s sale — more than 50 times the painting’s estimated value at the time. It was later identified as “a work of great significance” by the Dutch painter, according to a Sotheby’s press release published prior to Wednesday’s sale.

After the anonymous buyer consigned it to Sotheby’s, the auction house embarked on an 18-month research project to arrive at the painting’s true attribution and value.

The examination, which involved X-rays and infrared imaging, as well as intensive discussions with leading Rembrandt scholars, led Sotheby’s to conclude the painting is “an autograph work by Rembrandt.” Prior to the sale, the auction house gave the work an estimated value of £10 million to £15 million ($12.6 million to $18.8 million).

The auction house believes it was painted early in Rembrandt’s career, around 1628, when he would have been aged 21 or 22 and living in the Dutch city of Leiden.

A rare find

The vast majority of Rembrandt’s works hang in museums around the world, and almost all of those that have come to auction over the past three decades “have been portraits or studies of single character heads,” according to the Sotheby’s release.

As such, “Adoration of the Kings,” which depicts the encounter between the Three Wise Men and the baby Jesus, represented a “fantastic opportunity” in the art world, George Gordon, co-chairman of Old Master Paintings Worldwide at Sotheby’s, told CNN prior to the sale.

In a phone call with CNN, he said: “I would say that it’s particularly significant because it adds to our understanding of Rembrandt at this crucial date in his development and career, when he was clearly very ambitious and developing very quickly as an artist.”

The earliest reference to the painting appears to be from the 1714 inventory of a collector in Amsterdam, Constantijn Ranst. It was then offered for sale in 1814 and again in 1822, after which it disappeared from view until the mid-20th century.

It was included in museum exhibitions and referenced as a Rembrandt work by leading Rembrandt scholars in the 1950s, but in 1960 German art historian Kurt Bauch, who only knew the painting from a black and white photograph, described it as a product of the Rembrandt School and omitted it from from the catalogue raisonné he was compiling. Thereafter, the painting was “entirely overlooked and completely ignored in the Rembrandt literature,” according to Sothebys.

Gordon told CNN that those bidding at the Christie’s auction in 2021 “must have thought it was much better than the description and that it might well be a Rembrandt.”

Sotheby’s close examination revealed a number of changes and revisions that Rembrandt made, including to the baby Jesus’ halo and the Virgin Mary’s headdress, according to the auction house.

“Very few narrative paintings by Rembrandt remain in private hands, making this an opportunity for a private collector or an institution that is as rare as it is exciting,” Gordon had said in the news release.

“This sophisticated painting is in equal measure a product of Rembrandt’s brush and his intellect. All the hallmarks of his style in the late 1620s are evident both in the visible painted surface and in the underlying layers revealed by science, showing multiple changes in the course of its creation, and casting fresh light on how he thought,” he added.","['14', 'valued', 'paintings', 'sothebys', 'million', 'auction', 'rembrandt', '15000', 'cnn', 'christies', 'painting', 'work', 'sale', 'sells']","London CNN —A painting valued at $15,000 just two years ago fetched almost £11 million ($13.8 million) at a Sotheby’s auction on Wednesday after being identified as the work of the Dutch master Rembrandt.

168,Florence Nightingale: ‘Final’ photos of nursing pioneer up for auction,"London CNN —

Photos thought to be among the last taken of Florence Nightingale are among a number of items related to the famed English nurse going up for auction in London.

The small, sepia images were taken by Eliza Francis “Fanny” Pettit, who was Nightingale’s companion late in her life, and show the nurse sitting in an armchair, according to auction house Roseberys.

A photo from the sale shows Nightingale sitting in an armchair. from Roseberys London

They measure just 5.9 x 5.9 centimeters (2.3 x 2.3 inches) and were taken around 1910. Nightingale died on August 13 of that year, at age 90.

“The family history behind these photographs leads us to believe that they may be the final images taken of Nightingale,” Jack Wallis, a works of art specialist at Roseberys, told CNN.

“We can be certain that they were taken in 1910, and as such almost certainly in the final weeks or months of Nightingale’s life,” he said. The photos were exclusively exhibited at the Florence Nightingale Museum in London, confirming their authenticity, Wallis added.

“What makes them so special is their personal, candid nature - they are informal shots captured for posterity by a close friend to remember a much-loved principal,” he said.

Born in 1820, Nightingale was an English nurse who became the first woman to receive the Order of Merit, for her efforts treating wounded soldiers during the 1853-1856 Crimean War. She became famous as the “Lady with the Lamp” because of her reputation for making rounds at night to check on the patients.

Nightingale went on to play a key role in formalizing education for nurses, setting up the Nightingale School of Nursing at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London in 1860.

International Nurses Day is celebrated every year on May 12, Nightingale’s birthday, in her honor.

Other items in Thursday’s sale include a travel teapot and silver-plated tea caddy, given to Pettit by Nightingale, as well as a letter written by housekeeper Elizabeth Bosanquet detailing the last hours of Nightingale’s life.

In the letter, Bosanquet invited Pettit to visit “to look on Miss Nightingale’s peaceful face.”

“She passed away quietly at 2pm yesterday resting on her pillows just as she had been placed the night before,” it reads, according to Roseberys.

“It was very peaceful and merciful and one is so thankful she slept away with no suffering,” Bosanquet wrote. “We shall all be the better for her wonderful influence.”

Wallis said that “it is very rare for a collection of this nature to come to market, particularly in relation to an icon of British history such as Florence Nightingale.”

169,"FDA approves two gene therapies for sickle cell, bringing hope to thousands with the disease","CNN —

The US Food and Drug Administration approved two gene-based treatments for sickle cell disease Friday, including the first therapy that uses the gene-editing technique CRISPR, opening a new era of treatments for genetic conditions.

The medicines, called Casgevy and Lyfgenia, are potential cures for people with sickle cell, a debilitating and life-shortening inherited red blood cell disorder that disproportionately affects African Americans.

Casgevy is the CRISPR-based treatment, made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Crispr Therapeutics; Lyfgenia, made by bluebird bio, uses an older gene therapy approach. Both were cleared for people 12 and older with histories of vaso-occlusive crises, painful events caused by the disease.

“Sickle cell disease is a rare, debilitating and life-threatening blood disorder with significant unmet need,” said Dr. Nicole Verdun, director of the FDA’s Office of Therapeutic Products within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “We are excited to advance the field especially for individuals whose lives have been severely disrupted by the disease by approving two cell-based gene therapies today.”

Casgevy will cost $2.2 million for the one-time treatment, Vertex said in a regulatory filing, while Lyfgenia will cost $3.1 million, bluebird said in a news release.

A drug pricing analysis group, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, had suggested that a price of $1.35 million to $2.05 million for each therapy would have made them cost-effective and encouraged the companies to consider pricing the medicines at the lower end of that range to enable broader access.

For many in the sickle cell community, the approvals have been a long time coming. The disease afflicts about 100,000 people in the US, including an estimated 1 of every 365 Black babies born, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and has long been considered neglected by the pharmaceutical industry. About 20,000 people in the US are thought to have a severe enough form of the disease to potentially qualify for a treatment like this.

“To have sickle cell suddenly be the focus of this dramatic new approach to therapy development is, on the one hand, great, because hopefully it will undo some of that history of neglect and really give the sickle cell community the attention that is always needed,” Mayo Clinic bioethicist Megan Allyse said. She notes, however, that access to such a cutting-edge treatment, which now carries a price of more than $2 million, remains a major question.

The first ‘molecular disease’

The underpinnings of sickle cell have been understood for almost three-quarters of a century; in 1949, chemist Linus Pauling published a paper in the journal Science describing how the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin is different in people with sickle cell, declaring the malady the first “molecular disease.” That was four years before the famous double-helical structure of DNA was proposed.

“We’ve kind of been waiting for this ever since DNA was first discovered,” said Dr. Lewis Hsu, chief medical officer for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America and a physician who treats kids with sickle cell. “It’s been a long, long time coming.”

Sickle cell is caused by a genetic mutation that leads red blood cells, which contain hemoglobin and ferry oxygen around the body, to be misshapen, like crescents or sickles. These misshapen cells can get stuck in vessels, causing organ damage and – a hallmark of sickle cell – horrible bouts of pain that can last days, called vaso-occlusive, or pain crises.

Johnny Lubin is one of the youngest people to have had the CRISPR treatment, as part of a clinical trial. Before he went through it, he recalls, he had one main concern.

“I was worrying that I might get, like, superpowers,” said Johnny, now 15, who lives in Trumbull, Connecticut, about 60 miles north of New York City.

Before he had the treatment, “it was kind of hard for me to do things like have fun and stuff, because I’d always have to be worried about if I’d have a pain crisis,” Johnny said. The pain “would mostly be in my lower back, and it would always be like a pounding pain. … It hurt a lot.”

Until now, the only hope for a cure for people with sickle cell was with a bone marrow, or stem cell, transplant. But Johnny, like more than 80% of patients with sickle cell, couldn’t find a donor that matched.

For the first 13 years of his life, Johnny was hospitalized every few months because of pain crises and other complications from the disease. His parents had to stock opioid pain medicines and always had a “go bag” with them in case they needed to go to the hospital on short notice.

But since October 2021, when Johnny received a one-time infusion of his own gene-edited cells, he hasn’t had another crisis.

“He’s been like a normal child,” said Johnny’s mother, Fabienne Desir. “It’s life-changing for us.”

A new tool for editing genes

CRISPR is a gene editing technique that enables scientists to make precise cuts in DNA. The first scientific paper about it was published in 2012, and its development – by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier – won the Nobel Prize in chemistry just eight years later.

For sickle cell, patients’ cells are removed from the body and CRISPR is used to make an edit that turns back on production of fetal hemoglobin, a form of the protein that babies make in the womb. Once the edited cells are returned, the fetal hemoglobin can make up for the mutated hemoglobin that causes sickle cell, explained Dr. Monica Bhatia, chief of pediatric stem cell transplantation at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, who helped run the trial Johnny participated in.

“Fetal hemoglobin, we know, has a higher oxygen-carrying capacity than adult hemoglobin or sickle hemoglobin,” Bhatia said.

Making fetal hemoglobin along with sickle hemoglobin renders a patient similar to someone with sickle cell trait, Bhatia explained; that’s when someone inherits one sickle cell gene and one normal gene, and they “do not have any of the complications of the disease,” she said. “It is more than good enough.”

Indeed, Dr. David Altshuler, chief scientific officer at drugmaker Vertex, pointed out that some people naturally have genetic mutations that keep fetal hemoglobin high, “and they don’t have symptoms, even if they have the disease.”

“So it was like a physiologic, demonstrated approach that would work if you could turn on fetal [hemoglobin],” he said.

Clinical trial results, including Johnny’s, bear that out. In data cited by the FDA ahead of an advisory committee meeting on the therapy in October, 29 of 30 patients reached the trial’s main goal: freedom from a pain crisis for at least 12 months after treatment. The longest time without a crisis was 45.5 months, almost four years, and researchers will continue to follow the patients.

The hope is that the effects could last their entire lives.

“We don’t have as much long-term data as we do for stem cell transplant,” Bhatia said. “But that would be the hope, is that this would be comparable to a transplant and it would be sustained.”

The second therapy approved on Friday, Lyfgenia, was expected to be approved a few weeks later. It involves an older technology, using a virus to deliver a healthy copy of the gene that produces adult hemoglobin to make up for the one producing the sickled form. It also involves removing the patient’s cells and then returning them. It’s shown similarly encouraging results.

“These both bring tremendous benefit to the patients,” bluebird CEO Andrew Obenshain said.

Whether people will be able to afford and access these treatments, though, is a key question. In addition to the multimillion-dollar price tags of the treatments themselves, they require the infrastructure of large medical systems.

“I don’t know whether it will get covered and paid for,” Hsu said.

Bluebird said Friday that it’s in “advanced discussions” with the largest commercial health insurance providers in the US, as well as more than 15 Medicaid agencies, representing 80% of people with sickle cell in the country. The company noted that it has designed “outcomes-based” contract options for insurers that tie payment for the therapy to how well it works over time.

The drug will start to be available early next year, bluebird said.

Hsu noted another factor influencing how easily people will be able to access these new treatments is where they’re offered: typically at academic medical centers in larger cities.

“I’m in Illinois, and they’re basically concentrated in Chicago, which leaves the entire rest of the state kind of bare, and so people would have to travel a very long distance to be able to get to this,” he said. “And then some states, there just isn’t anything.”

And the treatments aren’t simple; they require a lot of additional care around them that adds to the cost. For the CRISPR treatment, patients typically stay in the hospital for about a month to prepare for the re-infusion of gene-edited cells, first going through what’s known as “conditioning”: several days of chemotherapy to wipe out their bone marrow, which makes blood cells and platelets, so they’re ready to receive the new cells. The bluebird gene-editing treatment requires the same chemotherapy conditioning.

After the infusion, “it takes a period of time for those cells to kind of take up residence in the bone marrow and grow,” Bhatia said.

That period around the infusion can be very difficult for patients and their families; Johnny’s mom described how Johnny’s “whole GI tract was inflamed; he couldn’t swallow. That was really painful. It was hard to watch.”

And that chemotherapy conditioning carries risks, including the possibility of infertility, Hsu noted. He pointed out there are methods of trying to preserve fertility before the treatment, but coverage for that can vary by state as well. And more than half of people with sickle cell in the US depend on Medicaid for their primary insurance, according to the advocacy organization Sick Cells.

The conditioning treatment also carries a potential risk of cancer; two patients in earlier stages of bluebird’s trial died after developing leukemia, which the company suggested was unlikely to be related to the gene therapy itself but potentially from the chemotherapy needed to prepare for it.

The FDA included its strongest warning, put in a black box on the drug’s label, about the potential risk of blood cancer with Lyfgenia, noting “patients receiving this product should have lifelong monitoring for these malignancies.”

The FDA didn’t include a similar warning for Casgevy. Regulators said Friday that was because Vertex hadn’t seen cases of cancer in its clinical trials.

Vertex’s Altshuler said his company is working on improving the conditioning process to make it gentler, to “create the opportunity for the new cells to go in without any other damage to the body,” although he noted that it’s still in the research phase.

Scientists also are vigilant about potential off-target effects of the CRISPR gene-editing approach – meaning DNA could be cut in an unintended place – and the FDA convened a full-day meeting in October to assess those risks. Many experts there expressed confidence that those risks were “relatively small.”

To Altshuler, the bigger deal in an approval of Casgevy is that there’s such an advancement for sickle cell disease, not that it’s the first CRISPR therapy.

“We’re not about a tool; we’re about the disease,” Altshuler said. “Once we found the way in, and now we’ve shown you can treat this disease very effectively if you can increase fetal [hemoglobin], we’re going to drive on that.”

The company is in the very early stages of researching how to achieve an increase in fetal hemoglobin using a pill, so patients wouldn’t need to go through the conditioning and gene editing process, Altshuler said.

He noted that it’s very early days but said that kind of approach could be the answer to the “very valid” question of “how are we going to help people around the world with this therapy?”

The majority of patients with sickle cell live in Africa and India, and bluebird’s Obenshain said the company doesn’t have plans to introduce “this version” of its gene therapy there, noting that it’s too expensive to manufacture.

“Basically, for every patient, we manufacture one drug lot,” Obenshain said.

For Johnny and his family, the effects of his treatment have been so transformative they now celebrate the day he got the infusion of gene-edited cells as his second birthday. He can go swimming – previously an activity guaranteed to trigger a pain crisis – without fear and spent all of last summer in the pool, his family says.

And although he didn’t gain the superpowers he worried about, he got something potentially even better: the chance to be a normal kid.

170,‘Turtwig’ ancient turtle species discovered after fossil mystery solved,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Ancient plant fossils that puzzled scientists have turned out not to be plants after all, new research has revealed.

Instead, the small round shapes bearing a leaflike pattern were once the shells of baby turtles that lived during the time of dinosaurs. Scientists have nicknamed the turtle species “Turtwig,” after a Pokémon character that is half-turtle, half-plant.

The discovery marks the first time baby turtle carapaces have been found in northwestern South America, according to the study authors.

The results of their research were published Thursday in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.

“In the Pokémon universe, you encounter the concept of combining two or more elements, such as animals, machines, plants, etc.,” said lead author Héctor Palma-Castro, a graduate student of paleobotany at the National University of Colombia, in a statement.

“So, when you have a fossil initially classified as a plant that turns out to be a baby turtle, a few Pokémon immediately come to mind. In this case, Turtwig, a baby turtle with a leaf attached to its head.”

But it took some sleuthing to solve this paleontological mystery that began decades ago.

Wrong place, wrong time

It all started when Colombian priest Padre Gustavo Huertas discovered the fossils in the Paja Formation. The formation is part of one of Colombia’s geological heritage sites called the Marine Reptile Lagerstätte of the Ricaurte Alto.

Previous fossil discoveries from the site include dinosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, ichthyosaurs, turtles and crocodile relatives called crocodylopmorphs dated from the Early Cretaceous Period, between 113 million and 132 million years ago.

Huertas collected fossils and rocks at the site, near the town of Villa de Leyva, from the 1950s to the 1970s. When he found the leaf-patterned rocks, he deemed them a fossil plant. Huertas went on to describe the specimens as Sphenophyllum colombianum in a 2003 study.

But other scientists were surprised to hear that the plant was discovered in northern South America and dated between 113 million and 132 million years ago. The now-extinct plant, once prevalent around the world, died out more than 100 million years earlier, according to the fossil record.

Previous research about the plant showed that its leaves were typically wedge-shaped with veins that radiated out from the base of the leaf.

The age and location of the fossils intrigued Palma-Castro and Fabiany Herrera, the assistant curator of paleobotany at the Negaunee Integrative Research Center at Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History.

Herrera collects and studies plants from the Early Cretaceous Period (100.5 million to 145 million years ago) in northwestern South America, a part of the continent where little paleobotanical research takes place.

Both fossils, about 2 inches (5 centimeters) in diameter, were housed in collections at the National University of Colombia’s department of geosciences. As Herrera and Palma-Castro examined and photographed the fossils, they thought something seemed strange.

“When you look at it in detail, the lines seen on the fossils don’t look like the veins of a plant — I was positive that it was most likely bone,” said Herrera, the study’s senior author, in a statement.

Solving a fossil mystery

Herrera contacted his colleague Edwin-Alberto Cadena, a senior lecturer and paleontologist who studies turtles and other vertebrates at Del Rosario University in Bogotá, Colombia.

“They sent me the photos, and I said, ‘This definitely looks like a carapace’ — the bony upper shell of a turtle,” said Cadena, a study coauthor, in a statement. “I said, ‘Well, this is remarkable, because this is not only a turtle, but it’s also a hatchling specimen, it’s very, very small.’”

Cadena and one of his students, Diego Cómbita-Romero at the National University of Colombia, compared the fossils with the shells of other extinct and modern turtles.

“When we saw the specimen for the first time I was astonished, because the fossil was missing the typical marks on the outside of a turtle’s shell,” said study coauthor Cómbita-Romero in a statement. “It was a little bit concave, like a bowl. At that moment we realized that the visible part of the fossil was the other side of the carapace, we were looking at the part of the shell that is inside the turtle.”

During their analysis of the shells, the researchers determined that the turtles were about 1 year old at the most when they died.

As young turtles develop, their growth rates and sizes can vary, Cómbita-Romero said. But it’s rare to find remains of young turtles because the bones in their shells are so thin.

“These turtles were likely relatives of other Cretaceous species that were up to fifteen feet long, but we don’t know much about how they actually grew to such giant sizes,” Cadena said in a statement.

The researchers didn’t blame Huertas for mistakenly categorizing the fossils as plants. What he believed to be leaves and stems were the vertebrae and rib bones within a turtle’s shell.

“We resolved a small paleobotanical mystery, but more importantly, this study shows the need to re-study historical collections in Colombia. The Early Cretaceous is a critical time in land plant evolution,” Herrera said.

The research team next aims to uncover the forests that once grew in the region, he said.

“In paleontology, your imagination and capacity to be amazed are always put to the test,” Palma-Castro said. “Discoveries like these are truly special because they not only expand our knowledge about the past but also open a window to the diverse possibilities of what we can uncover.”","['turtles', 'plant', 'million', 'shells', 'species', 'university', 'solved', 'fossils', 'turtwig', 'ancient', 'fossil', 'discovered', 'mystery', 'study', 'turtle', 'research']","CNN —Ancient plant fossils that puzzled scientists have turned out not to be plants after all, new research has revealed.

171,Shoes and germs: Should you ask your party guests to go barefoot?,"Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.

CNN —

At-home holiday parties are on many people’s calendars right now, and germ-conscious hosts are faced with a dilemma: Should I require my guests to take off their shoes at the door, especially if the gathering is cocktail or formal attire — or the guest is a stylish shoeaholic like Carrie Bradshaw?

In a 2003 “Sex and the City” episode, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is asked to leave her $485 Manolo Blahnik shoes at the door during a New York City baby shower hosted by her friend Kyra (Tatum O’Neal) and soon finds they have been stolen.

“I hadn’t even done a full lap around the party,” Carrie lamented later at a lunch with her friends. The iconic TV character had been forced to walk home in her party dress and old gray sneakers lent by her host.

“Why in the h*ll did you take off your shoes to begin with?” asked Carrie’s friend Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall).

“We had to!” Carrie explained. “For their kids — apparently we drag things in on our heels that make children sick.”

While the episode, “A Woman’s Right to Shoes,” was designed to discuss dilemmas facing single people in a world focused on families with children, the underlying question — and debate — around footwear and health remains: Is there significant evidence going shoeless stops the spread of germs in a home?

“Absolutely,” said Gabriel Filippelli, chancellor’s professor for the department of Earth sciences at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and executive director of Indiana University’s Environmental Resilience Institute.

“We can track in all sorts of bacteria, but certainly some of the ones we’re most concerned about are E. coli that cause severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting,” he said. “There’s been studies that swab the bottom of shoes and something like 99% of the shoes test positive for fecal material.”

Heavy metals and more

However, bacteria are not the only danger that rides along with the dust and dirt surrounding rural and urban homes, gardens and parks, said Jill Litt, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado in Boulder who is currently working as a senior researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, or ISGlobal, in Spain.

“Studies have shown that in urban areas where there are older homes, lead in dust can be tracked into the home on the surface of shoes,” she said. “Other studies have shown that you can bring in pesticide residues from gardens via shoes.”

Heavy metals like lead and copper and zinc permeate the soils of urban parks and streets from decades of pollutants, while pesticide levels can be high in rural agricultural areas, Litt added.

Homes built before 1978 are very likely to contain lead-based paint, which can chip, peel and disintegrate into dangerous dust, experts say. There is no safe level of lead at any age, but children are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of heavy metals and pesticides due to their small size and proximity to contaminants as they crawl, roll and play on the floors of the home.

“For little ones, hand to mouth is one of the primary ways children get exposed to toxic substances and infectious disease agents,” said Litt, who is also a leader of Reimagining Environments for Connection and Engagement: Testing Actions for Social Prescribing in Natural Spaces. Funded by the European Union, the project aims to fight loneliness with natural spaces.

Wet mop first

Before you ask folks to take off their shoes, be sure the home is as dust-free as possible, experts say. Never vacuum or sweep with a broom first, as that will only stir up all the toxins, sending them airborne. Instead, reach for the wet or spray mop. As counterintuitive as it may be to add water to dirt, it’s actually the best way to remove toxins, Litt said.

The same goes for any horizontal surface, Filippelli said, but stay away from feather dusters. “Do more regular cleaning of horizontal surfaces with a damp cloth — that’s windowsills, tables, coffee tables, chair bottoms, chair seats and other furniture in addition to the floor.”

Use the “three-bucket” method if you live in an older home with lead paint or an area with high levels of lead outside. Have one bucket ready with an all-purpose cleaning solution, another to rinse and an empty bucket.

“Some folks also use a very weak vinegar solution in their wash water, which works really well,” Filippelli said. “There are some super sterilizers on the market, but when cleaners are really good at killing bacteria, they’re usually not very good for us as human beings. Whenever you can smell a superstrong smell from something, you got to at least think twice about it.”

Dip your mop into the cleaning solution, squeeze the excess water into the empty bucket, and begin to mop, starting from the farthest point from the door. Work toward the door, using the clean water as a rinse as you go. Flush water into the toilet when it looks dirty or with each new room — don’t throw it outside.

“The highest concentration of germs is in the interior entry way and levels go down as you move greater distances from this area,” Litt said. “Carpeting retains a lot of dust so that would be one thing I would remove if you had concerns about dusts and potential health concerns.”

Carpeted areas should be vacuumed with a device that has a high-efficiency particulate air, or HEPA, filter, not bagless vacuums, and throw the bag or filter away in an outside trash can when done.

Honor cold feet

Taking off shoes at the door may be the best way to limit germs and potentially toxic dust from coming inside, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t think of your guests’ comfort, Filippelli said. Providing washable slippers or nonslip socks can be a thoughtful gesture.

“I do not like to walk around with bare feet inside, so here’s my hack. I have some warm slippers right inside my front door — a lot of other cultures do that as well,” he said.

“Go to any Asian household, or even a Middle Eastern one and there’s often a little cubby right inside the door with washable slippers. You’re supposed to take your shoes off there and take the slippers and put those on.”

Would that have solved Carrie’s shoe-removal problems? No, those were taken care of when she asked Kyra to buy new Manolo’s as a gift for Carrie’s impending marriage — to herself.

“That’s all she registered for?” Kyra asked the salesperson, as her kids ran around the swanky Manolo Blahnik store on Madison Avenue.","['guests', 'litt', 'lead', 'water', 'slippers', 'party', 'right', 'germs', 'door', 'dust', 'carrie', 'shoes', 'barefoot', 'ask', 'asked']","“I hadn’t even done a full lap around the party,” Carrie lamented later at a lunch with her friends.

172,‘The Brick’ is at the center of our galaxy. An unexpected new finding may help unlock its mysteries,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

A box-shaped cloud of opaque dust that lies at the center of our galaxy has long perplexed scientists, and observations that reveal a new detail about its composition are deepening the mystery — possibly upending what’s known about how stars form.

The cloud, nicknamed “the Brick” for its visual impenetrability and rectangular appearance, was previously estimated to hold more than 100,000 times the mass of the sun. And such a dense blob should be churning out massive new stars, based on researchers’ current understanding of star formation.

But it’s not.

The Brick is largely dormant. And the latest observations, made using the James Webb Space Telescope, did not reveal any hidden, young stars.

The new Webb data instead unveiled that the Brick is not just made up of gas. It’s also littered with frozen carbon monoxide — much more than previously expected — according to a study published Monday in The Astrophysical Journal. And there’s more ice forming deeper into the Brick.

The findings could have drastic implications for how scientists analyze this region going forward. More carbon monoxide ice inside the Brick could dramatically change how researchers study and measure dark clouds in the center of the Milky Way.

“We are (now) closer to understanding what exactly is happening in the Brick and where the mass is,” said University of Florida astronomer Adam Ginsburg, lead author of the study. “But we opened more questions than we closed with this.”

Among those questions: Why and where is this carbon monoxide freezing into ice?

Other mysteries that loom for this region remain unanswered as well: Why can’t we see any new stars forming? Is the Brick not as dense as scientists once believed? And what are the strange ridge- and filament-like features that show up within the Brick?

“We have more to investigate before we can really be sure what’s going on,” Ginsburg said. “I would say we’re in the hypothesis-forming phase, not the drawing conclusions phase.”

What Webb revealed

Ginsburg and his fellow researchers, which included University of Florida graduate students, first got their hands on this new Webb data in September 2022.

It was a crucial moment. As the most powerful space telescope ever constructed, Webb could offer never-before-seen insights into the Brick. But right off the bat, Ginsburg and his team found the data needed a lot of work. The Webb telescope orients itself using a map, determining which direction it’s pointing by referencing where it is in relation to known stars.

An image of the Brick captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. The cloud resides near the galaxy’s center, about 26,000 light-years from Earth, according to NASA. Adam Ginsburg

The trouble was, “there’s so many stars at the galactic center that it gets confused,” Ginsburg said. So, researchers had to spend months cleaning up the data, orienting it to line up correctly with the existing maps of the sky.

Then, as they peered at the Brick, they found that the images from Webb were turning out the wrong color.

“All the stars were coming out a bit too blue,” Ginsburg said, prompting researchers to wonder if something was wrong with the data.

But it turned out, he said, the problem was with their assumptions. The scientists hadn’t expected there to be so much carbon monoxide ice — and that was the cause of the color change, according to the study.

Learning of the existence of the ice could have broad ripple effects for all kinds of research into the center of the Milky Way, said Dr. Natalie Butterfield, an assistant scientist at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, who was not involved in the study.

Butterfield said her own research — which includes studying supernovae and the radiation between star systems — could be forever altered by understanding the existence of this carbon monoxide ice. It could change how scientists estimate the mass of all the clouds in the galactic center.

Why carbon monoxide matters

There are several perplexing things about all this carbon monoxide ice. For instance, the area is fairly warm — around 60 Kelvin (minus 351.67 degrees Fahrenheit) — while carbon monoxide typically freezes at 20 Kelvin.

It could be that the dust inside the Brick is much colder than the gas, causing the carbon monoxide around the dust particles to turn solid. Or, Ginsburg said, it could be that water is freezing, trapping carbon monoxide inside.

The answer matters.

All the ice in a region such as the Brick can give scientists new insight into our solar system — even our home planet.

The ice and water that exist on Earth, for example, likely arrived here via comets. So, where ice exists in the universe and how it forms can help researchers understand where these comets come from and how they collected the materials they deposited.

Where are the stars?

And then there is the big mystery of why there is a lack of star formation within the Brick.

Scientists already know that new stars are brewed from dust clouds and hydrogen molecules. But scientists cannot directly observe hydrogen molecules within the Brick — or anywhere else in the universe — because they’re invisible to telescopes.

However, scientists also know that for every hydrogen molecule, there’s likely a certain amount of carbon monoxide. And carbon monoxide is visible — so scientists can measure it as a proxy for identifying how many hydrogen molecules are in a given area.

Researchers have been using this method for measuring hydrogen molecules for 50 years, Ginsburg said.

But they’ve always assumed the carbon monoxide was gas — not solid ice, as the Webb data revealed. This finding opens a whole new can of worms, Ginsburg said.

Ginsburg noted that it’s crucial for researchers to understand what state of matter the carbon monoxide is in — gas or solid — to arrive at the right answers.

Every new piece of knowledge about the Brick and its makeup better informs why this opaque cloud isn’t producing stars, even though — by most accounts — it should be one of the most active star nurseries in the galaxy.

“It’s a really natural place for new stars,” Ginsburg said. “But we haven’t found very many — only a very, very tiny handful.”

There are some possible answers that Ginsburg and other researchers are anxious to explore: Perhaps the Brick is more spread out — less compact — than scientists once thought. Or maybe it’s just too young, and its star-forming days are ahead.

Those are questions, Ginsburg and Butterfield said, that Webb can continue to help researchers answer.

“It’s just an impressive, impressive telescope,” Butterfield said. “I think this is just the first of many unique results that will be coming out of the JWST for the galactic center.”","['galaxy', 'mysteries', 'center', 'webb', 'carbon', 'unlock', 'unexpected', 'researchers', 'stars', 'monoxide', 'ice', 'brick', 'telescope', 'scientists', 'ginsburg', 'help', 'finding']","It’s also littered with frozen carbon monoxide — much more than previously expected — according to a study published Monday in The Astrophysical Journal.
More carbon monoxide ice inside the Brick could dramatically change how researchers study and measure dark clouds in the center of the Milky Way.

173,Scientists reveal new insights into mysterious baboon mummies of ancient Egypt,"CNN —

To date, tens of millions of animal mummies have been unearthed in Egypt. But while there are millions of mummified cats, dogs, ibises and birds of prey, primate mummies are rare — and little understood.

Now, new analysis of mummified baboons is shedding light on the animals’ place in ancient Egypt, revealing that, while they were prized as sacred animals, their living conditions were less than ideal.

Researchers analyzed bones from mummified baboons, which were discovered in the early 1900s in the necropolis Gabbanat el-Qurud, in the so-called Valley of the Monkeys, to the southwest of Egypt’s Valley of the Kings. The bones represented dozens of individual baboons — from infants to adults — in two species: the hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas) and the olive baboon (Papio anubis).

These species weren’t native to Egypt — they were imported from two regions: “the olive baboon from the south (present-day Sudan), and the hamadryas baboon from mountainous areas bordering the Red Sea, in Sudan and southwards to Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia,” said lead study author Wim Van Neer, a professor emeritus at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels. “The exact provenances still need to be documented in more detail,” Van Neer told CNN in an email.

Of all the animals that the ancient Egyptians venerated, baboons were the only ones not native to Egypt, Van Neer added.

The baboons are thought to have played a role in ancient Egyptian rituals, the scientists reported Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. But raising and caring for large wild animals — particularly non-native species — is challenging. Before their deaths the baboons were sunlight-deprived and developed bone ailments from poor nutrition, researchers discovered. Examination of the skeletal remains revealed signs of rickets; the baboons had deformed arms, legs and faces, undeveloped teeth, osteoarthritis and other pathologies due to deprivation and metabolic disease.

Their deformities resembled those seen in the bones of baboons from two other ancient Egyptian sites — Saqqara and Tuna el-Gebel — dating to around the same period, the authors wrote.

“This excellently crafted and executed study confirms the results of some earlier investigations concerning the health status of baboons in ancient Egypt,” said Dr. Salima Ikram, a Distinguished University Professor of Egyptology from the American University of Cairo, who was not involved in the research. “More importantly, it also establishes the fact that different types of baboons were being brought to and reared in Egypt,” Ikram told CNN in an email. “It is fascinating to think that the ancient Egyptians tried to institute a breeding programme for baboons so that they could both be revered as well as used in religious rituals.”

A jumble of bones

At the three main Egyptian sites where mummies of Old World monkeys were interred, 463 mummified primates have been discovered, according to the study. The baboon bones examined for the new analysis were collected in 1905 and 1906 by archaeologists from the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle de Lyon in France (now the Musée des Confluences).

In the tombs were pieces of dried skin with long tufts of hair still attached, suggesting that the animals had been placed there as mummies. The French archaeologists recovered 23 skulls, 24 mandibles and more than 200 isolated bones, which were assembled into complete skeletons regardless of whether all the bones belonged to the same baboon, according to the study.

Two skeletons had been cobbled together from bones belonging to two different baboons, and one skeleton represented three of the primates. Of the four skeletons that were properly put together, only one had the correct skull. After analyzing the bones one by one, the study authors identified 36 different baboons of all ages, a set with more adults than juveniles and a few more males than females.

The bones also revealed signs of metabolic problems during adolescent growth, including curved shafts, misshapen shaft heads and arthritic joints. Two female baboons had suffered from tooth decay. There were lesions in some of the skulls; two of the primates had shortened snouts, and two others had snouts that bent to the left.

The mummies were also centuries older than previously thought. Based on the mummies’ proximity to nearby ceramic artifacts in the tombs, earlier estimates placed them between the first and second centuries at the earliest, and possibly as recent as the seventh century.

But when the study authors examined bone collagen and fibers from a textile that had been wrapped around an intact baboon mummy, they found that the animals were likely entombed between 803 and 520 BC. The researchers confirmed that time frame using a technique called radiocarbon dating, which can determine the age of organic material by measuring the amount of decay in a radioactive isotope of carbon.

Sacred and suffering

Conditions for the captive primates may have been even worse than their remains suggested, as bones often don’t preserve records of parasites and other types of ailments, the researchers reported.

However, it’s important to note the scientists’ findings don’t suggest that the baboons were being intentionally abused. Their keepers likely did the best that they could to care for the animals, “but this must not have been easy,” Van Neer said.

“Baboons are good climbers and they were therefore probably kept in buildings or enclosures with high walls to prevent them from escaping. Because of the lack of sunlight they developed the metabolic disorders that we see, mainly rickets. There are no signs of broken bones that would suggest the animals were ill-treated physically,” he said.

“Unfortunately, the Egyptians did not know enough about the care and feeding of baboons,” Ikram added. “While trying to give them reverence and care they actually established conditions detrimental to the health and well-being of the animals — the way to hell is paved with good intentions!”

174,Rishi Sunak is picking a fight on the migration issue that he probably cannot win,"CNN —

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has a major problem.

As his governing Conservative Party prepares to enter what will likely be an election year in 2024, it is languishing behind the opposition Labour Party in polls week after week.

The Conservatives have been in power since 2010, during which time they’ve gone through five prime ministers and virtually every possible iteration of conservatism imaginable. And after 13 years in power, it’s fair to say the party looks a little tired and out of ideas.

This is why Sunak is leaning into the Conservatives’ historical trump card issue: immigration.

Sunak, himself the son of immigrants, is currently throwing absolutely everything he has at trying to bring down the UK’s net migration numbers – which reached a record high of 745,000 in 2022.

That high number exists for various reasons: The UK has had generous policies to welcome people fleeing Ukraine and Hong Kong in recent years.

Since leaving the European Union, the UK is no longer part of the Dublin Regulation, an EU law that is designed to share the burden of hosting asylum seekers across the bloc by allowing member states to return migrants to the EU country they first entered – something the UK used effectively and benefited from.

The implications of this can be seen most clearly in the number of people now crossing the English Channel in small boats.

The boats are largely run by criminal trafficking gangs who help migrants illegally enter the UK in unsafe, crowded vessels that have on multiple occasions led to people drowning.

While these small boats are not the chief reason for the UK’s immigration numbers, they arguably have the highest profile.

In 2018 , the number of people detected crossing the English Channel in small boats was 299, according to Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. In 2022, that number was 45,755.

Of course, 45,755 is a fraction of the 745,000 net immigration total. However, for the places that are most affected by these small boat landings, that enormous increase is very visible. For the people who live in areas where these migrants end up being housed while their asylum claims are processed, it is impossible not to notice the influx into local populations.

Politically, small boat crossings have become a touchstone issue for the next election – hence Sunak making stopping the boats one of his five key priorities at the start of this year.

He has inherited a controversial plan from his predecessors whereby the UK reached an agreement with Rwanda that refugees could be sent to that country instead of staying in the UK. To date, the UK has not sent a single person to Rwanda because courts have prevented them from doing so. Most notably, the European Court of Human Rights has blocked flights to Rwanda from taking off. In short, there are human rights concerns that people who are sent to Rwanda could still face oppression in Rwanda or be sent back to their country of origin.

Sunak this week unveiled a bill that was designed to block any legal reason that planes were not flying people to Rwanda. His immigration minister resigned hours later and it is possible that his government will lose a vote on the bill in parliament next week. Meanwhile it was revealed that the British government had paid the Rwandan government an additional £100m this year as part of the deal. It had already sent £140m to the country.

For a country that in 2016 voted to leave the European Union, a foreign court interfering with domestic law is something that creates political opportunities. Enter Nigel Farage.

Farage, one of the most high-profile Brexit campaigners, has been using his media profile and daily TV show to talk about small boats for a long time.

His tactic of attacking Sunak and the Conservatives from the right has over time forced some on the right of the Conservative Party to call for increasingly tough action on immigration. Some even think there is an argument for the UK leaving the ECHR. And with an election coming up, some are even wondering if promising some kind of referendum on the UK’s membership of the ECHR in the Conservative manifesto might be a way of keeping voters who are tempted to cast their ballots for smaller right-wing parties.

Indeed, Sunak’s recently-sacked home secretary said in a statement to parliament earlier this week: “The powers to detain and remove must be exercisable notwithstanding the Human Rights Act, the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention, and all other international law … it is now or never. The Conservative Party faces electoral oblivion in a matter of months if we introduce yet another Bill destined to fail. Do we fight for sovereignty or let our party die?”

If this all sounds familiar, that’s because it’s all happened before. It was Farage’s Euroskeptic rabble-rousing that forced former Conservative leader David Cameron to put a Brexit vote in his party’s 2015 manifesto. Cameron won that election, but was forced to resign a year later after losing the referendum. Sunak can at least ask Cameron for advice, having recently made him the UK’s foreign secretary.

While Cameron has been publicly supportive of Sunak’s Rwanda plan and the bill introduced this week, it’s not hard to imagine him telling his boss that on Europe and immigration, the Conservatives simply cannot win.

The reality is that the bar set by Farage and some of his own MPs is so high that there is no way Sunak can clear it. Whatever he does, it will never be enough for the voters most-motivated by migration.

On the left – which in modern British politics can at times really mean center-right – Sunak risks looking cruel, kicking down at people who are fleeing war zones and trying to send them to a place where they are still not safe.

Sunak is desperate to flip the debate over to Labour, forcing them to take a position on immigration – but this issue is intensely toxic for Conservatives. There will always be people with the luxury of sitting outside of mainstream politics who can make noise.

And beside all of this, British attitudes to migration have evolved in the past few years – the idea of simply being strong on immigration winning votes for the Conservatives is not as true as it once was.

Some who saw it as a key issue now recognize that the health service benefited from migrant labor. Some feel post-Brexit that their concerns were addressed and that the country now has control over immigration. There are still people who care a lot about migration, of course, but the general direction of travel is that views are softening.

Given the difficult position he’s in, it’s no surprise that Sunak is looking for wedge issues ahead of the next election. But it might be that the PM has picked a fight he simply can’t win.","['rishi', 'rwanda', 'fight', 'immigration', 'party', 'sunak', 'picking', 'week', 'migration', 'small', 'conservatives', 'uk', 'boats', 'issue', 'probably', 'win', 'sent']","The implications of this can be seen most clearly in the number of people now crossing the English Channel in small boats.

175,Egypt’s president expected to secure third term as the world’s eyes are fixed on Gaza,"CNN —

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to secure his third term in power in a Sunday presidential election that critics have called a sham, as global attention is focused on the bloody war in neighboring Gaza.

The 69-year-old president has enjoyed two months of a pause in criticism from Western allies over his authoritarian rule and heightened crackdown on dissent, experts say, attributing the shift to Sisi’s renewed diplomatic relevance on the international stage due to the Israel-Hamas war.

Several top Western officials have paid Sisi visits since the war began, including United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

HA Hellyer, nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in London, said that Cairo has historically been “a critical interlocutor for the international community in general when it comes to the Arab-Israeli conflict.”

“As the Israeli-Palestinian question diminished in importance in many policy arenas, which was clearly a fundamentally flawed approach, so did Cairo’s geopolitical weight,” Hellyer told CNN, adding that with the Palestinian issue now prominently back in discussions, “there is a new prioritization internationally for good and comprehensive contact with Egypt.”

Egypt controls the Rafah crossing, the sole remaining link between the Gaza Strip – which Hamas controls – and the outside world. Egyptian officials have played mediation roles in previous wars between Israel and Hamas, as Cairo maintains diplomatic ties with both sides. During the current conflict, Egypt’s good offices have been used to deliver crucial aid into Gaza and to help secure the release of some of the hostages held there by Hamas since its militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting more than 240 others.

Egypt has also helped foreign nationals escape the carnage in Gaza, along with injured Palestinians. More than 17,000 Palestinians have so far been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which cites sources from the Hamas-controlled enclave. Aid has also been able to trickle into Gaza through Rafah.

Meanwhile, Sisi is moving to quietly secure another presidential term with little to no opposition at home or abroad, critics say.

“There are no elections. There is electoral theater,” Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington, DC, told CNN, citing the lack of viable opposition to Sisi.

The former field marshal rose to power in 2013 after overthrowing Mohamed Morsy, Egypt’s only democratically elected president, in a military coup. Sisi ran for president in 2014 and 2018, winning both elections with a sweeping majority. In 2019, his government passed constitutional amendments that permitted him to run for a third term.

“The terrible violence we’re witnessing (in Gaza) helped Sisi divide the attention of the public from their domestic concerns onto what’s happening, particularly the Palestinians in Gaza,” Kaldas said. “And as a result, somewhat reduce the level of focus on their own domestic plight, particularly their economic struggles.”

Egypt has also spent the past two months reminding its international partners of how “vitally important” it is, Kaldas said. Egypt can say: “See the useful role we play in negotiations and facilitation of the humanitarian assistance that needs to go to Gaza,” he added.

Sisi has appeared keen to capitalize on the crisis and present himself as a champion of the Palestinian cause. In a speech last month, the president repeated his call for a ceasefire, as well as his refusal of the “displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip,” calling such a prospect a red line.

While diplomats have been focused on Gaza, critics and human rights groups have lambasted Egypt over the past two months for what they say is its suppression of political dissent and silencing of opposition candidates.

Former lawmaker Ahmed el-Tantawy, who was the most prominent potential challenger to Sisi before he ended his campaign in October, said his supporters were restricted from registering their endorsements for him. He ended his campaign after failing to register the number of signatures required to run.

The Egyptian National Elections Authority (NEA) denied el-Tantawy’s claims, according to state media.

Three other candidates are running for president, with little support expected for each. These are the head of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, Farid Zahran; Wafd party nominee Abdel Sanad Yamama; and Republican Peoples’ Party candidate Hazem Omar.

Rights watchdog Amnesty International said last month that “genuine opposition candidates (were) barred from running” in Sunday’s election, adding that since October 1, Egyptian authorities “have arrested and interrogated at least 196 individuals due to their participation in unauthorized protests, as well as on allegations of engaging in terrorism-related activities and spreading ‘false news.’”

Amnesty also criticized Egypt’s prosecution of el-Tantawy, along with members of his campaign, which the rights group says are under fire “in retaliation for exercising their rights to political participation and to freedom of expression and association.”

El-Tantawy is accused of circulating election-related papers without the permission of the authorities. His trial date was pushed to January 9.

“Once more, the Egyptian authorities lay bare their utter intolerance for even the faintest whisper of dissent,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, as he urged the country to lift “sweeping restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.”

The Egyptian government’s foreign press center did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.

‘No one will come out to vote’

Just days before the election, streets in the capital, Cairo, were draped with large banners bearing Sisi’s portrait. An increased security presence is noticeable throughout the city, with officers and checkpoints dotting squares, highways and the entrances to bridges.

Among those boosting the pro-Sisi campaign is the Nation’s Future Party. “We are all with you” and “beloved of millions,” read the party’s pro-Sisi banners.

Despite the president’s high-profile election campaign, public sentiment is marked by frustration. Grievances regarding the economy are most evident.

Magdy Gerges, an Egyptian in his 50s who works as a driver, said economic hardships were painful, but that he feels a sense of security under Sisi’s rule.

“I’m one of those who suffer from the high prices, but this man (Sisi) gives me something more important than food; that I feel safe whenever my daughters go out,” Gerges told CNN. “By the end of the day, we will manage with our income, but what good is money if there is no security?” he said.

Gerges noted however that there are no other viable alternative candidates for voters to choose from, especially given the region’s precarious security situation.

“Even if we want to choose someone else, we have no alternative,” he said.

Another citizen, who asked to remain anonymous fearing reprisal from Egyptian authorities, questioned the legitimacy of Sunday’s election, saying polling stations will be empty since Sisi’s victory is clear.

“No one will come out to vote. People know the result in advance, so why this farce?” the man told CNN, saying it might have been better to “save these huge sums of money in the difficult economic conditions we are living in.”

Hellyer, of the Carnegie Endowment, said that with the current crisis in Gaza, Cairo might even see “potential for substantial economic assistance” from foreign nations, given the role it has played.

Egypt has been struggling to dig itself out of a debt hole that experts say requires structural reforms to avert economic collapse. Cairo’s allies in the Persian Gulf, who for years bailed out the most populous Arab nation, had in recent months criticized Egypt, saying the days of blank cheques are now over.

Egypt’s economic woes are far from resolved. Inflation is still high, and a foreign currency crisis remains unremedied. The country is also yet to meet the terms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $3 billion loan secured in December 2022 but which is yet to be disbursed.

Kaldas, of the Tahrir Institute, said that the Egyptian pound is expected to devalue further. The dollar now trades officially at 31 Egyptian pounds, and if the government decides to further devalue the exchange rate after the elections, that will translate to higher inflation, a deepening of economic hardship for individuals and businesses, and a rise in poverty, he said.

“There is no short-term scenario that doesn’t mean more economic pain for the average Egyptian,” Kaldas added.

The election takes place from December 10 to December 12. Results are expected by December 18.","['worlds', 'international', 'egyptian', 'economic', 'expected', 'sisi', 'egypt', 'opposition', 'eyes', 'egypts', 'president', 'gaza', 'term', 'cairo', 'election', 'secure', 'fixed']","CNN —Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to secure his third term in power in a Sunday presidential election that critics have called a sham, as global attention is focused on the bloody war in neighboring Gaza.

176,Bear attacks in Japan are at a record high. Climate change and an aging population are making the problem worse,"Tokyo CNN —

Seishi Sato had an ominous feeling when he saw something rustling in a bush during a recent stroll in a forest in northern Japan.

Before he knew it, two Asiatic bears had sprung from the shrub, one charging at him as he frantically tried to fend it off while fearing for his life.

“When I saw them, I was so close and I thought I was in deep trouble,” the 57-year-old from Iwate prefecture, in northeast Japan, told CNN.

He survived the attack — but not without plenty of scratches and puncture wounds on his arm and thigh.

Sato is among at least 212 people who survived what has been a record year for bear attacks in Japan, according to the Ministry of Environment. Six people have died.

With a month of 2023 still to go, this year’s total has already far surpassed the 158 that took place throughout the whole of 2020 (the previous record year). And the number of bear attacks have never exceeded 200 per year since record began in 2006.

Sightings of “kuma”, or bears, are not unusual in Japan but are generally concentrated in the northern part of the country, where mountain ranges, lush bush and crystal-clear rivers provide an ideal habitat and abundant sources of the acorns, beechnuts, fruits and insects that make up their diet.

But experts say Japan’s bears are increasingly venturing out of their traditional habitats and into urban areas in search of food. Some suggest this is because climate change is interfering with the flowering and pollination of some of the animals’ traditional sources of food.

“Bears are expanding their home range this year and are coming down to areas near human settlements in search of food,” said associate professor Maki Yamamoto, who studies bears at the Nagaoka University of Technology in Niigata.

Increasingly, this is bringing them into the paths of people like Sato, who was attacked just a half-hour walk from the shop he runs, where he sells pet supplies and mushrooms he picks from the forest.

“People are becoming very alert to this situation,” said Sato, adding that other residents had been attacked outside the front doors of their village homes.

As of November, there had been 19,191 sightings across the country, up from 11,135 sightings throughout the whole of the previous year and 12,743 in 2021.

Iwate, where Sato lives, has logged more cases than anywhere else - 5,158 – followed by its neighboring prefecture of Akita, which has reported 3,000 sightings.

So pressing has the issue become that Environment Minister Shintaro Ito pledged last month to help affected communities.

“We are considering providing emergency assistance to local communities in response to their needs, such as surveying and capturing bears living in the vicinity of human settlements, taking into consideration the wishes of prefectures where human casualties due to bears are particularly on the rise,” he told a press conference.

Protective mama bears

Japan is home to two main types of bear: brown bears, which live in Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan’s main islands, and a small population of Asiatic bears, which reside in Honshu, Japan’s largest island.

Both breeds have an omnivorous diet, enjoy feeding on acorns and tend to avoid humans if possible. An Asiatic bear weighs between 40 and 100 kg while a Japanese brown bear can grow up to 400kg. But both are far from being the biggest bear on earth. Kodiak Brown Bears in Alaska, for example, can weigh up to 600kg.

“Both brown bears and Asiatic black bears are basically timid animals that avoid people,” said Professor Koji Yamazaki from the Tokyo University of Agriculture.

When bears do attack, the cause is usually because a mother bear fears an encounter with a human poses a threat to her cub, experts said.

Sato, who runs the YouTube channel Primitive Forest Bear to share his adventures in nature, recalled that the Asiatic bears he ran into appeared to be mother and child.

He captured the attack on camera and posted the video online as a reminder to others to take care.

The video, which has since gone viral, shows him screaming for his life and hitting the animal with a tree branch to drive it away. At one point, he climbs a tree to avoid being mauled. Luckily, the bear eventually turns away.

“When I saw the video, I was scared to death,” Sato said.

Climate change and population shifts

With encounters on the increase, some experts believe climate change may be a factor in pushing bears further from their traditional habitats.

“The thing is that you can have years of bad harvests and years of good harvest of acorns. And when the harvest is bad, the bears cannot store enough energy before hibernation by eating mountain acorns alone, so they get closer to human settlements looking for fruits, chestnuts, persimmons, walnuts, and farm products in general,” Yamamoto, from Nagaoka University of Technology, explained.

“This year, bears have been appearing more in the villages precisely because of the very bad harvest of acorns from the beech, the bears’ favorite tree,” she said.

Tsutomu Mano, a senior research fellow at the Hokkaido Research Organization, said climate change “is likely to have a significant impact on the flowering time of plants and the activity of insects responsible for pollination, which is necessary for fruiting.”

And when the bears don’t have enough food, they often turn to human neighborhoods to look for leftovers in the bins, he said.

Once they’ve developed a taste for human leftovers they will keep returning for more, Mano said.

Another factor that some believe may be coming into play is Japan’s rapidly shifting demographics.

With a median age of 48, Japan has one of the world’s oldest populations, according to the Economic and Social for Asia and the Pacific, a United Nations’ arm that tracks population trends.

At the same time, the country is experiencing a shift in which younger generations are increasingly moving to big cities for better job opportunities.

Taken together, the two factors mean populations on the rural edges of northern prefectures are fast dwindling, creating conditions such as “abandonment of cultivated land and overgrowth along riversides” that “make it easier for bears to enter,” according to Mano.

According to national broadcaster NHK, out of the 71 people attacked by bears in October, 61 were above the age of 60. Twenty-one people were in their 80s.

On October 24 alone, four people – all in the 70s – were injured in Akita on the same day, the broadcaster reported.

What’s the solution?

At Karuizawa, a resort town located in Nagano prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, conservationists have taken to patrolling the forest with dogs to scare the bears away, according to local media.

But officials in Akita prefecture, which recorded the second-highest number of bear attacks, have a more drastic measure in store. They have begun offering rewards to trappers.

Governor Norihisa Satake announced late last month a 5,000-yen ($33) prize for each bear captured in the prefecture. The authorities are also mulling a proposal to set aside a fund of up to 15 million yen ($100,000) to pay for the transportation of the captured bears.

But experts say a more holistic approach is needed.

“Trapping is not sufficient to manage bears, so it is necessary to consider a combination of various methods,” said Yamazaki, from the Tokyo University of Agriculture.

The first step was to study what types of bear – in terms of their ages, genders and locations - were going astray and why, he said.","['record', 'sato', 'brown', 'making', 'climate', 'japan', 'population', 'problem', 'high', 'bear', 'bears', 'asiatic', 'university', 'change', 'prefecture', 'human', 'worse', 'acorns']","Before he knew it, two Asiatic bears had sprung from the shrub, one charging at him as he frantically tried to fend it off while fearing for his life.

178,Billionaire Ken Langone is latest GOP megadonor to endorse Nikki Haley,"CNN —

Billionaire Ken Langone on Friday endorsed Nikki Haley’s presidential bid in the latest sign of the Republican moneyed class rallying behind her as the main alternative to Donald Trump in the GOP primary.

“I think she is just what we need right now. I think her approach is smart. I think she’s qualified,” Langone said on Fox News. “More importantly, I think the American people need this kind of leadership – statesmanlike, elegant. Just think of … where we have been in the last six or seven or eight years. It is not good at all.”

Langone, a co-founder of Home Depot, is the latest in a growing list of wealthy donors to back the former South Carolina governor. The network associated with billionaire Charles Koch announced its support for her last week, as did North Carolina retail magnate Art Pope. Earlier this week, LinkedIn co-founder and billionaire Democratic donor Reid Hoffman gave $250,000 to support her campaign.

Langone said that while he likes GOP contender Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor’s “numbers aren’t moving.”

“The writing is on the wall,” Langone told Fox News. “On the other hand, Nikki Haley has had a substantial upswing. The one thing I’m committed to is we have to beat Joe Biden. If Joe Biden is going to be the nominee, we have to beat him. We can’t take any more of this mayhem.”

Asked why he didn’t endorse Trump, Langone said the former president’s time has “come and gone” and condemned his actions toward the end of his White House tenure.

“What Trump put this country through the last three months of his presidency was disgraceful,” Langone said.

“I think what happened on January 6 – all he had to say is ‘Please go home.’ … But he sat in a room and watched it for three hours and did nothing about it and America deserves better than that,” he added.","['joe', 'endorse', 'megadonor', 'think', 'gop', 'support', 'trump', 'week', 'nikki', 'haley', 'langone', 'latest', 'need', 'billionaire', 'ken']","CNN —Billionaire Ken Langone on Friday endorsed Nikki Haley’s presidential bid in the latest sign of the Republican moneyed class rallying behind her as the main alternative to Donald Trump in the GOP primary.

179,Appeals court maintains most of Trump gag order in federal election subversion case,"CNN —

An appeals court has largely upheld the gag order against former President Donald Trump in the federal election subversion case, saying he can be barred from talking about witnesses as well as prosecutors, the court staff and their family members.

But the court said the gag order does not apply to comments made about special counsel Jack Smith and narrows the prohibition Trump had for speaking about witnesses in the case, a change from the original gag order.

The decision against Trump is a striking admonishment for an ex-president facing an upcoming criminal trial, but also makes clear Trump is still allowed to criticize President Joe Biden and the Justice Department and to argue the prosecution “is politically motivated or that he is innocent of the charges against him.”

The three appeals court judges who issued Friday’s ruling — Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard and Bradley Garcia, all Democratic appointees — found Trump’s words on the public stage could undermine the fairness of a jury trial, sway or intimidate witnesses and imperil court staff. The court said that justifies limiting Trump’s speech, even while he campaigns to return to the presidency.

It is the second time in recent weeks that an appeals court has reinstated limits on what Trump can say publicly. Trump’s also under a gag order in New York barring him from attacking court staff in a civil fraud trial against him and his business there. Trump is set to testify in that case on Monday.

Trump vowed to appeal the decision in a social media post on Friday.

Friday’s lengthy opinion came from all three judges who heard Trump’s appeal at the DC Circuit Court nearly two weeks ago, and was written by Millett.

“Mr. Trump’s documented pattern of speech and its demonstrated real-time, real-world consequences pose a significant and imminent threat to the functioning of the criminal trial process in this case,” the appeals court wrote.

The court said that Trump’s campaign for the 2024 presidency “does not alter the court’s historical commitment or obligation to ensure the fair administration of justice in criminal cases.”

“We do not allow such an order lightly. Mr. Trump is a former President and current candidate for the presidency, and there is a strong public interest in what he has to say,” the court said.

“But Mr. Trump is also an indicted criminal defendant, and he must stand trial in a courtroom under the same procedures that govern all other criminal defendants. That is what the rule of law means.”

Court cites Trump’s attacks on Meadows and Pence

In explaining their decision, the appeals court pointed to the former president’s many public statements and attacks against witnesses in the case, including former chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Vice President Mike Pence.

The court said that such statements “pose a significant” risk that witnesses would be intimidated and “unduly influenced” in the case. Some witnesses have “had their lives turned upside down after coming within Mr. Trump’s verbal sights,” the court wrote.

The court also noted that Trump is subject to release conditions barring him from direct communication with witnesses.

That prohibition “would mean little if he can evade it by making the same statements to a crowd, knowing or expecting that a witness will get the message,” the court wrote.

The risk to witnesses “is largely irreversible in the age of the Internet,” the court noted. “Once an individual is publicly targeted, even revoking the offending statement may not abate the subsequent threats, harassment, or other intimidating effects during the pretrial as well as trial stages of this case.”

The court also noted Trump’s public statement shortly after being charged in the case, “If go after me, I’m coming after you,” as a broadly threatening message toward people working on the case, and said his “messaging [was] daggered at likely witnesses and their testimony.”

Trump is still able to publicly share opinions about witnesses who include several high-profile critics of his who served in his presidential administration.

Trial delay would ‘simply compound the problem’

In the ruling Friday, the appeals court pushed back forcefully against Trump’s argument that his criminal trial should be delayed until after the 2024 presidential election as an alternative to limiting his speech, writing that it would be “counterproductive, create perverse incentives, and unreasonably burden the judicial process.”

Trump has repeatedly argued in court that his criminal trial in the election interference case, which is scheduled for March, should be delayed until after the November presidential election. So far, all of his efforts have been rejected.

“Allowing prejudicial statements to go unchecked for an even longer pre-trial period would simply compound the problem,” the appeals court wrote.

The court also said that allowing the former president’s threatening speech to “override the district court’s control and management of the trial schedule” would incentivize other criminal defendants to also say or post harmful things as a means of delaying their own prosecutions.

The gag order doesn’t prohibit Trump from making any comments but rather statements “made with the intent to materially interfere” with the case. For instance, Trump can publicly speak about witnesses, the appeals court said, but not about their “potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding.”

The appeals court said his words about possible witnesses would have to be looked at in context.

“That allows the former President to continue to speak out about those same persons’ books, articles, editorials, interviews, or political campaigns as long as he does so in a manner that does not concern their roles as witnesses or the content of any expected testimony,” the court wrote.

In addition, the court strongly backed his ability to disparage the special counsel.

“As a high-ranking government official who exercises ultimate control over the conduct of this prosecution, the Special Counsel is no more entitled to protection from lawful public criticism than is the institution he represents,” the court wrote.

180,Comer says special counsel indicted Hunter Biden to ‘protect him’ from House GOP investigation,"House Oversight Chair James Comer told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Friday he believes special counsel David Weiss indicted Hunter Biden to shield him from his scheduled deposition next week in front of Comer’s committee.

“My concern is that Weiss may have indicted Biden to protect him from him having to be deposed in the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday,” Comer said on CNN’s “The Lead with Jake Tapper.”

Comer then went further, arguing that Weiss’ entire criminal investigation – which has now indicted Biden in two states and could send him to prison for more than 40 years – “has been about a cover up.”

The Kentucky Republican framed the dozen federal charges brought against Biden so far, relating to a 2018 gun purchase and an alleged tax evasion scheme, as “the least little thing.”

“Look what he’s done,” Comer said. “Anybody else in America would already be in prison.”

In the interview, Comer repeatedly claimed Hunter Biden is guilty of illegal foreign lobbying and “influence peddling” schemes involving his father. Hunter Biden hasn’t been charged with lobbying offenses and nothing in the indictments backs up the GOP claims that Joe Biden was involved in his son’s business deals.

Comer’s comments come as he has demanded Hunter Biden appear for a closed-door deposition on December 13. Biden’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, has told Congress his client is only willing to appear for a public hearing. If Biden does not appear on Wednesday, Comer said he will hold the president’s son in contempt of Congress for evading his subpoena, taking the standoff to a breaking point.

Lowell told CNN’s Pamela Brown Friday evening that a decision had not yet been made on whether his client will appear for the deposition.

Lowell also told Brown that Comer’s suggestion Hunter Biden was charged to protect him was “ridiculous.” Had the Republican chairman argued the move was to protect the special counsel, Lowell said he might have agreed.

“(Weiss is) doing this because he took such unbearable pressure and heat and criticism on June when we did the deal that he reneged and now he’s going to show over and over again that he is not going to make another mistake that subjects him to that kind of political pressure,” he told Brown on “The Source.”

The criminal case into the president’s son was nearly resolved in July, but a planned plea deal fell apart after scrutiny from a federal judge and legal disputes between the two sides.

The new tax charges stem from Hunter Biden’s lucrative overseas business dealings – including his involvement with Ukrainian energy company Burisma and a Chinese private equity fund – which are at the center of House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden.

This story has been updated with additional details.

181,Montgomery riverfront brawl: Trial of two men charged in the melee is expected to begin today,"CNN —

Two men involved in an August 5th brawl on the riverfront dock in Montgomery, Alabama, pleaded guilty to harassment charges on Friday for their roles in the dispute, which garnered national headlines, according to court documents.

Allen Todd and Zachery Shipman each had a 60-day jail sentence suspended, pending their cooperation in performing their remaining duties, the Montgomery docket says. Both defendants will be required to complete 12 months of probation and 100 hours of community service. They will also have to enroll in and complete anger management training, and pay their individual court costs.

Video of the melee went viral as some believed the fracas was racially motivated. The dispute started when a cruise ship was trying to dock in its designated parking spot, but found a private boat was in its space, Montgomery Police Chief Darryl Albert said in August. The dispute ended with the defendants – the occupants of the private boat – fighting Damien Pickett, the co-captain of the Harriott II cruise ship, when he confronted them about moving.

The riverboat, with 227 passengers, waited about 45 minutes as Pickett tried to reach the occupants of the docked boat using a PA system. But “they were only responded to with obscene gestures, curse words and taunting,” Albert said.

Pickett was then picked up by a young dockworker in another vessel and taken to the dock so he could try to speak with the boat occupants and get them to move, Albert said. There, the boat occupants confronted the captain in a “very hostile manner,” the chief said.

Pickett was “attacked by several members of the private boat” and was treated at a hospital that night, the chief said. Several Harriott II crew members came to Pickett’s defense, according to the chief.

The incident largely broke down along racial lines in a city with both a fraught history of racial violence and a proud place in the civil rights movement.

Police said Pickett, who is Black, and the 16-year-old White dockworker who ferried him over to speak with the owner of the private boat, were both assaulted.

Two other defendants charged in the case were sentenced in October after pleading guilty.

Mary Todd was sentenced to anger management classes after pleading guilty to harassment as part of a plea agreement.

Richard Roberts, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault, was sentenced to 32 days, which he was set to serve on weekends over the course of four months, along with community service.

The two defendants each have a 30-day review scheduled; Jan. 8 for Shipman, and Jan. 9 for Todd.","['riverfront', 'melee', 'pickett', 'men', 'defendants', 'boat', 'dock', 'trial', 'expected', 'private', 'montgomery', 'begin', 'guilty', 'charged', 'todd', 'occupants', 'today', 'sentenced', 'brawl']","Allen Todd and Zachery Shipman each had a 60-day jail sentence suspended, pending their cooperation in performing their remaining duties, the Montgomery docket says.

182,"Man accused of firing shotgun outside synagogue in upstate New York is taken into custody, police say","CNN —

A man taken into custody after shots were fired outside an Albany, New York, synagogue hours before a Hanukkah observance was set to begin told investigators “events in the Middle East” have impacted him, a federal law enforcement official said in court documents.

Mufid Fawaz Alkhader, 28, of Schenectady, faces a charge of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, according to a criminal complaint filed in US District Court for the Northern District of New York.

Mufid Fawaz Alkhader Albany County Sheriff's Office

He had an initial court appearance Friday morning and was detained pending trial after waiving his right to a detention hearing, the US Department of Justice said in a news release.

CNN has reached out to his defense attorney for comment.

Alkhader faces up to 15 years in prison, up to three years of post-imprisonment supervised release and a maximum fine of $250,000.

The incident comes as Jews, Muslims, Palestinians and others in the US say they are growing more fearful of hate-motivated attacks while war between Israel and Hamas continues in the Middle East. Recent cases like the death of a Jewish protester during a rally in Southern California and the shooting of three Palestinian college students in Vermont highlight the mounting tensions.

Alkhader allegedly stood outside of Temple Israel “possessing a Kel-Tec KS7 12 gauge pump shot gun” and then “fired two rounds” into the air Thursday afternoon, according to the criminal complaint.

After the shots were fired, the suspect fled a few hundred yards from the parking lot and was confronted by a person in a vehicle, Albany Police Chief Eric Hawkins said Thursday. The suspect told the man in the vehicle he felt victimized, Hawkins said.

The suspect then dropped the shotgun and police took him into custody, Hawkins said. Based on the information police have, the man acted alone and there was no broader threat to the community, the chief added.

During his interview with law enforcement, Alkhader “said a variety of things,” including “that events in the Middle East have impacted him,” and that he “regularly uses marijuana,” the law enforcement official said in the complaint.

Ultimately authorities found probable cause to conclude that Alkhader “knowing that he was an unlawful user of a controlled substance (marijuana)… did knowingly possess a firearm,” the complaint said.

The complaint also states the gun was manufactured outside the state and has “therefore traveled in interstate commerce.”

Gov. Kathy Hochul directed state police and the National Guard to increase Hanukkah patrols following the incident.

Any act of antisemitism would be unacceptable, “and undermining the public safety at a synagogue on the first night of Hanukkah is even more deplorable,” Hochul said in a news conference Thursday. “As New Yorkers, this is not who we are. This must stop. We reject hate, antisemitism, Islamophobia all hate crimes must stop and all violence in every form must cease.”

183,Federal appeals court blocks some of New York gun law,"CNN —

A federal appeals court has blocked enforcement of three parts of a New York gun law that places restrictions on carrying a concealed firearm.

The 261-page opinion filed Friday partially leaves in place lower-court orders freezing enforcement of the concealed-carry law, while allowing most other aspects of the law to take effect. The law in question, the Concealed Carry Improvement Act, faced legal battles not long after its inception.

One part of the law, according to the opinion, requires prospective gunowners to “submit … a list of former and current social media accounts of the applicant from the past three years to confirm the information regarding the applicant[’]s character and conduct.”

Friday’s opinion from the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals blocks that requirement.

Another provision in the law “makes it a crime to possess firearms in a ‘restricted location,’” which could include private property that’s “generally open to the public” such as a grocery store.

Friday’s opinion strikes down that provision, with respect to “private property held open to the general public.”

Friday’s opinion freezes enforcement of one provision, which would have largely banned carrying a firearm at places of worship, for one group of plaintiffs that had previously sued, alleging “the place of worship provision substantially burdens their ‘right to the free exercise of religion.’”

The court noted its decision is not conclusive, and that the laws might be reinstated after being fully examined by the lower courts.

“Our affirmance or vacatur of the district courts’ injunctions does not determine the ultimate constitutionality of the challenged CCIA provisions, which await further briefing, discovery, and historical analysis, both in these cases as they proceed and perhaps in other cases,” the court opinion said.

Friday’s opinion largely leaves other requirements of the law in place, such as “in-person meeting with a licensing officer” for those looking to carry a concealed license, and “four character references who can attest” to a person’s “good moral character.”

The state can also bar carrying in “sensitive locations” such as zoos and public parks.

In January, the Supreme Court rebuffed an emergency request from challengers to consider the law and kicked it back to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.

Proponents of the law said they were pleased by the decision for allowing much of the measure to remain enforceable by the state.

New York Attorney General Letitia James applauded Friday’s opinion, saying: “Today’s decision to permit the state to enforce critical provisions of the Concealed Carry Improvement Act as the court process moves forward will help keep New Yorkers safe.”

“This commonsense law was enacted to keep guns out of dangerous hands and away from schools, hospitals, parks, public transportation, and other sensitive locations. My office will continue to defend New York’s gun laws and use every tool to protect New Yorkers from senseless gun violence,” she said.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul also praised Friday’s ruling, calling the legislation “nation-leading.”

“These laws instituted common-sense protections to strengthen background checks, protect sensitive locations, and ensure permits are issued responsibly,” she said.

“Now, even after a year of legal assault from right-wing extremists, core tenets of our laws remain in effect following today’s ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Public safety is my top priority, and I’ll continue my efforts to keep New Yorkers safe,” she added.","['blocks', 'york', 'appeals', 'opinion', 'yorkers', 'law', 'court', 'provision', 'sensitive', 'laws', 'public', 'gun', 'concealed', 'federal']","CNN —A federal appeals court has blocked enforcement of three parts of a New York gun law that places restrictions on carrying a concealed firearm.

184,"With 40 days until Iowa caucuses, these Trump voters are looking for alternatives","Cedar Rapids, Iowa CNN —

Sally Hofmann has been thinking and praying about the Republican presidential race.

“I pray for the candidates,” said Hofmann, a conservative Christian who for months has been watching the GOP contenders with an open mind. “I think it’s just so important who gets in office and the direction they lead this country.”

The voting at the Iowa caucuses takes place on January 15, when Republicans gather in neighborhood precincts across the state. But December is when many undecided voters will make their choices, fueling a sense of urgency for the campaigns of Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley and others, who have only 40 days left to make their case.

Hofmann, who twice voted for Trump and was considering him this fall, has settled on a new choice.

“I’m leaning towards DeSantis. I think I’ll go that direction,” Hofmann said in an interview in the living room of her farmhouse outside Cedar Rapids. “I’m thankful for what Trump did when he was in office, but I’ve been a little bit disappointed in Trump lately.”

A season of choosing

As fall turns to winter here, it’s a season of political choosing for Republicans taking part in the first stop of the party’s presidential nominating process. It’s a particularly critical moment for DeSantis and Haley to show that the primary is still a true contest, not merely a coronation for Trump.

There’s little doubt Trump remains an unparalleled driving force in the campaign. He returned to Iowa on Tuesday – his second visit in four days – in a strategic effort to maintain his dominance and avoid allowing too many onetime supporters like Hofmann to break away.

Yet exhaustion with the former president among the party faithful – once barely whispered about – now freely comes alive in conversations with Republicans like Roger Dvorak, who has planted a Haley campaign sign in the front yard of his Cedar Rapids home.

“I would like to see her get the nomination. She’s a woman with empathy,” Dvorak said of the former South Carolina governor, who he has seen twice during campaign stops in eastern Iowa. “She listens to you when you ask her a question, and she gives you an honest answer, whether you like that answer or not.”

But Dvorak’s decision to support Haley is also a reflection of his concern about Trump and the criminal cases pending against him. He believes it would be a distraction the country cannot afford.

“Whether he’s guilty or not, I don’t know. We’ll have to wait and see,” Dvorak said. “I just don’t think he can be effective as a leader of the country.”

Elevating an underdog or humbling a front-runner

The question is how many Iowa Republicans are inclined to go against the grain of their Trump-controlled party as they make their final decisions.

The caucuses have traditionally served as a way of to narrow a crowded field, rather than to pick the candidate who goes on to become the nominee. Many caucusgoers take pride in elevating underdogs or humbling front-runners.

Few credible polls have been conducted in recent weeks, which one Republican strategist told CNN was akin to “flying blind, given so many new developments in the race.” In late October, Trump maintained an overwhelming advantage – more than 25 percentage points – over DeSantis and Haley in an Iowa poll conducted by The Des Moines Register.

It’s unknowable whether that snapshot still offers an accurate view of the state of play.

Marvin Goodyk, a Republican from central Iowa who recently decided to support DeSantis, echoed the sentiment of many voters when he said he neither believed nor was driven by polls.

“First of all, I’m not sure that I agree with all the polls. They’ve lied to me before,” Goodyk said. “It’s not over ‘til it’s over. And if Trump wins, then OK, I go that way.”

Karen Hanna, who voted twice for Trump and had been considering him again this year, also recently decided to support DeSantis. She, too, said she was concerned about “all of the things that Trump is going through with the courts.”

“I like Haley, I do,” Hanna said Sunday, standing near the back of a DeSantis event at a coffee shop in Eldridge. “But I like Ron DeSantis better. She has some good ideas, but I like what he stands for. He’s a good fit for what I believe in.”

For candidates not named Trump, even a race for second place is important, with the margin of victory – or loss – a key indicator of whether a campaign will move beyond Iowa or New Hampshire, which holds the first-in-the-nation GOP primary on January 23.

Reaching a decision

Hofmann, who keeps busy with church activities and her seven grandchildren, has likely paid closer attention to the race than most Iowans, but she is far from a Republican insider. She has not watched any of the presidential debates, because they have been held on Wednesdays, which is traditionally a night many Christians attend church events.

She has not gone to a single campaign rally. And she has seen the candidates only once, from her seat at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition dinner in September. At that point, she was deciding between Trump, Haley and DeSantis.

But she has followed news coverage of the campaign, both on television and online, and studied the positions of various candidates. When Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Bob Vander Plaats, a state evangelical leader, issued their separate endorsements of DeSantis, she took notice.

“I have a lot of respect for them,” Hofmann said. “It helped in my decision, but I still liked to research him on my own and decide.”

In the end, she said, DeSantis won her support because of his strong anti-abortion views and conservative record as Florida governor. She also appreciated his support for Israel.

Feelings toward Trump, she said, are complicated among her conservative friends.

“I have conservative friends who are still Trump supporters,” Hofmann said. “But I also have some friends that are very disappointed in Trump. They don’t necessarily think he’s the man of integrity that they would like to see as president. I agree with some of those thoughts.”

She added: “The more I looked at Trump, the more I just really got discouraged by him.”

But she said she would support him if he became the nominee – a sentiment expressed by many Iowa Republicans who spoke to CNN. For now, though, Trump was not her top choice and she hopes Iowa can spark a new direction for the country.

“I think it’s more of a wide-open race,” Hofmann said. “It won’t surprise me if Trump gets it, and it won’t surprise me if he isn’t the nominee.”

185,CNN to host two GOP presidential primary debates in 2024,"CNN —

CNN will host two Republican presidential primary debates next month in Iowa and New Hampshire – states that hold the first contests in the race for the 2024 GOP nomination, the network announced Thursday.

The events will provide Republican voters an opportunity to hear the governing philosophies of the leading candidates seeking to challenge the likely Democratic presidential nominee, President Joe Biden, in November.

The first debate will take place on January 10 at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, less than a week before Iowa caucusgoers weigh in on the Republican presidential race. The second debate will be January 21 at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire.

To qualify for participation in the Iowa debate, candidates must receive at least 10% in three separate national and/or Iowa polls of Republican caucusgoers or primary voters that meet CNN’s standards for reporting, according to the network. One of the three polls must be an approved CNN poll of likely Iowa Republican caucusgoers.

Candidates will be invited to participate in the New Hampshire debate if they receive at least 10% in three separate national and/or New Hampshire polls of Republican primary voters that meet CNN’s standards for reporting. One of the three polls must be an approved CNN poll of likely New Hampshire Republican primary voters. Candidates who finish in one of the top three positions in the Iowa caucuses will receive an invitation to participate in the New Hampshire debate.

Former President Donald Trump, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have hit 10% in at least three qualifying polls, including one of likely caucusgoers in Iowa. DeSantis said Thursday in a post on X that he is “looking forward to debating in Iowa!”

The qualifying window for the Iowa debate closes on January 2 and the New Hampshire debate qualifying period ends on January 16.

According to the network, in each debate, candidates must also meet the definition of a “natural-born citizen,” as well as age and residential requirements as defined by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, file a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission and agree to accept the rules and format of the debate.

To determine polling eligibility in Iowa, only polling data collected from surveys that began no earlier than October 15, and released no later than 12:05 p.m. ET on January 2, will be considered.

In New Hampshire, only polling data collected from surveys that began no earlier than November 1, and released no later than 12:05 p.m. ET on January 16, will be considered.

Poll results reported with a decimal place will not be rounded up or down in either case.

National and state polling shows that former President Donald Trump holds a commanding lead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. But a handful of Republican candidates are battling to be the alternative to Trump.

The Republican National Committee said Friday that candidates are free to participate in any forum or debate of their choosing during January, freeing them from a previous requirement that prevented them from participating in non-RNC-sanctioned debates.

“We have held four successful debates across the country with the most conservative partners in the history of a Republican primary. We have no RNC debates scheduled in January and any debates currently scheduled are not affiliated with the RNC,” the RNC’s Committee on Presidential Debates said in a statement. “It is now time for Republican primary voters to decide who will be our next President and candidates are free to use any forum or format to communicate to voters as they see fit.”

ABC News and WMUR-TV will also hold a Republican presidential primary debate in Manchester, New Hampshire, days after the Iowa caucuses. The debate, in coordination with the New Hampshire Republican State Committee, will be held at Saint Anselm College on January 18.

Read the full CNN debate criteria below.

186,IOC: Some Russian Athletes Able to Compete Under Neutral Status at 2024 Olympics,"Chesnot/Getty Images

A limited number of Russian athletes will be able to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics under a neutral designation amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, the International Olympic Committee announced Friday.

""Only a very limited number of athletes will qualify through the existing qualification systems of the [International Federations],"" the IOC said in a statement.

The decision to allow a limited number of Russian athletes to compete in the 2024 Games comes after the IOC suggested in March that individual Russian and Belarusian athletes be allowed to return to competition under a neutral status as long as they have no military links.

Belarus has been a military ally to Russia amid the country's invasion of Ukraine, and Belarusian athletes have also been barred from events by the IOC.

The IOC said Friday that any athletes or support personnel ""who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies will not be eligible to be entered or to compete.""

Additionally, athletes and support personnel ""who actively support the war will not be eligible to be entered or to compete,"" the IOC said.

Prior to the start of the war, Russia sent 335 athletes to the Tokyo Olympics, which were held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Russian athletes competed under the Russian Olympic Committee as part of consequences for the country's doping scandal.

Russian and Belarusian athletes who are approved to take part in the 2024 Olympics will compete without their nation's flag, colors and anthem. The IOC said Friday that eight Russians and three Belarusians are among those to have qualified for the Summer Games.

While individual athletes will be allowed to compete, Russia and Belarus remain banned from team sports such as soccer and water polo.","['russian', 'athletes', 'neutral', 'able', 'support', 'olympics', 'military', 'status', '2024', 'belarusian', 'compete', 'number', 'ioc', 'russia']","Chesnot/Getty ImagesA limited number of Russian athletes will be able to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics under a neutral designation amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, the International Olympic Committee announced Friday.

187,Video: Cowboys' Dak Prescott Jokes About Haters in Colon Cancer Screening Commercial,"Cooper Neill/Getty Images

Playing quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys requires you to have thick skin because of the scrutiny that comes with it, as Dak Prescott proved in a new ad promoting colon cancer screenings.

The two-time Pro Bowler joked about his haters in the commercial, which includes clips of people criticizing his game.

Not only that, Prescott turns the joke into a useful tool by urging viewers to put a sticker of something they don't like on the sample collection container if they are prescribed a home-screening kit from their doctor.

Some of the example stickers Prescott uses include a dolphin, miner and eagle. There are also stickers of a bill and lion shown in the ad.

Prescott has acknowledged he hears the criticism of his game because it's ""hard to miss,"" even though he doesn't seek it out and it's ""it's not going to stop"" whether or not he complains about it.

This is a rather ingenious way of using the actual voice of his haters for a good cause.

The timing of it does lend itself to some unfortunate jokes if Prescott doesn't play well on Sunday when the Cowboys host the Philadelphia Eagles at AT&T Stadium in a crucial matchup that will determine who is in first place in the NFC East.","['uses', 'screening', 'video', 'haters', 'colon', 'stickers', 'doesnt', 'jokes', 'way', 'cowboys', 'using', 'prescott', 'cancer', 'commercial', 'voice', 'dak', 'viewers']","Cooper Neill/Getty ImagesPlaying quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys requires you to have thick skin because of the scrutiny that comes with it, as Dak Prescott proved in a new ad promoting colon cancer screenings.

188,"If Lakers Look Like This, In-Season Tournament Won't Be Only Trophy in Play for LA","Garrett Ellwood/NBAE via Getty Images

LAS VEGAS — After a crushing 133-89 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday, the Los Angeles Lakers look like bona fide title contenders again.

Their 3-5 start was at least mildly concerning. LeBron James' age, Anthony Davis' inconsistency and Austin Reaves' inability to live up to preseason hype cast some doubt on this team's ability to get back to the Western Conference Finals.

But that fifth loss, which happened back on November 8, suddenly feels much older than a month after the Lakers capped off an 11-4 surge up the standings with Thursday's dismantling of the Pelicans.

In the semifinals of the NBA's inaugural In-Season Tournament in Las Vegas, the older Lakers looked dramatically more spry than New Orleans.

LeBron, specifically, was cutting by Pelicans defenders like they were buried up to their knees in Nevada sand and sagebrush. Davis was a defensive menace all over the floor. D'Angelo Russell continued to quietly provide a reliable release valve for the superstars. And Reaves dominated the opposing reserves with his playmaking and shotmaking.

What seemed like a lack of connection to the game for the Pelicans certainly contributed to the lopsided result, but the Lakers were surgical from beginning to end. And when it looked like they might be able to run away with this game, that's exactly what they did.

With 3:08 left in the second quarter, Brandon Ingram made a free throw that cut L.A.'s lead to two points at 53-51. From there on, in just over two quarters of basketball, the Lakers outscored the Pelicans 80-38.

The 27-minute onslaught was a reminder of why so many were high on L.A. coming out of this offseason. When all of the above is clicking, LeBron and the rest of this team can overwhelm talented opponents (which is what New Orleans is, even if Thursday didn't demonstrate that).

Even at his advanced age (in relative terms), LeBron is one of the NBA's absolute best offensive orchestrators, but this team gives him multiple playmaking options he trusts. And turning over some of that responsibility to Reaves and Russell has freed LeBron up for more catch-and-shoot jumper opportunities and off-ball forays to the rim.

With his otherworldly combination of size and athleticism, LeBron could've been one of the best cutting scorers the game has ever seen, but the better option was almost always to have him on the ball, feeding the cutters. On this squad, there's a bit more balance in his scoring diet.

And empowering Reaves and Russell to feed him (and the rest of the Lakers) is helping them too.

Russell is quietly averaging 16.6 points, 6.3 assists and 2.2 threes, while shooting 40.5 percent from three. Reaves got off to a slow start to the campaign, but he's at 15.5 points and 4.6 assists over his last 10 games. And the team is comfortably outscoring its opponents when either shares the floor with LeBron.

Unsurprisingly, the same can be said of AD, who's taken plenty of flak for a handful of underwhelming performances. When he plays with LeBron, L.A. is borderline dominant, thanks in large part to his Defensive Player of the Year-level rim protection and ability to clean the glass.

But even when he or some of the other big-name players on this roster have occasional lulls, much of the above is sort of a given. What really has to be different from last season's team that got swept by the Denver Nuggets in the conference finals is the depth behind those four.

On Thursday, and for much of this recent run, it's looked ready to meaningfully contend for trophies.

Cam Reddish's perimeter defense has been instrumental for a unit that now ranks sixth on that end. Rui Hachimura is back in the lineup and shooting over 40 percent from three after dealing with injuries at the start of the year. Jarred Vanderbilt is slowly working his way back from his own absence.

And as those supporting players grow into their roles, it's easy to feel better about the team's prospects for a deep playoff run.

""I think we're starting to figure it out,"" LeBron said after Thursday's win. ""You know, you guys been asking me over the last couple months, what do you think about the team and what do I think we can be. My answer was realistic: We don't know because we haven't had our team.""

""But we are starting to get healthy,"" he added. ""We are starting to see what our team looks like. We know who we are going to be playing with out on the floor. Guys are feeling in a really good rhythm offensively and defensively.""

You could see that on vivid display in Vegas. On both ends of the floor, everyone was seemingly moving in concert. Defensive rotations were crisp. Cuts to the basket were timely. The extra pass was a staple of most possessions.

""I mean, the thing I'm starting to see is when we lock in, and everybody is pulling the rope in the same direction and everybody is focused on the objectives within the game plan and the strategy that we are using to attack these teams on both sides of the ball, and when we sacrifice one another, we are damn near unstoppable,"" Lakers coach Darvin Ham said after the game. ""It's a beautiful thing to see this early.""

Of course, the Lakers probably won't play like this in every contest from here on out. No team is perfect, and this one is particularly susceptible to injuries or late-season wear and tear.

But we're now getting a glimpse of what L.A. is capable of. And we might have the In-Season Tournament to thank for that.

""Again, I think the intensity that this tournament brings reveals [how good the Lakers can be] because it's not just a regular-season game,"" Ham said. ""It doesn't feel like that. The stakes are way higher and you see people in those delicate moments what they are truly made of, at least the beginning stages. So it's a good precursor, and it's a good prep environment for what's to come four or five months later.""

If the Lakers are this motivated and connected on Saturday, they should put up a ton of points on an Indiana Pacers defense that's ranked near the bottom of the league all season.

Even against MVP candidate Tyrese Haliburton, that should be enough to secure the cup.","['team', 'trophy', 'points', 'pelicans', 'think', 'tournament', 'play', 'lakers', 'starting', 'game', 'la', 'lebron', 'reaves', 'good', 'look', 'inseason', 'wont']","In the semifinals of the NBA's inaugural In-Season Tournament in Las Vegas, the older Lakers looked dramatically more spry than New Orleans.

189,Steelers Can Probably Kiss Playoffs Goodbye After Back-to-Back Embarrassing Losses,"Joe Sargent/Getty Images

A week after suffering a stunning 24-10 loss to the visiting Arizona Cardinals, the Pittsburgh Steelers were widely expected to bounce back against the New England Patriots. They lost 21-18, and what's worse, they were pretty far out of it for most of the game.



When the postseason starts in a little over a month, the Steelers might be out of that too.



Did anyone expect Pittsburgh to dominate? Perhaps not with backup quarterback Mitch Trubisky starting in the wake of Kenny Pickett's ankle surgery. However, the Steelers were at home, in command of the AFC's top wild-card spot and playing a two-win Patriots team that has looked as rudderless as any team in the league.



Instead of winning a close, gritty game, Pittsburgh lost it. Trubisky (22-of-35 for 190 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT) made the mistakes many could have anticipated, while the defense made Patriots backup Bailey Zappe look like Tom Brady for much of the contest.

The Steelers fell into a 21-3 hole and never managed to climb out of it.



The loss means that the Steelers have lost consecutive home games to two-win teams—something that would have been an unfathomable fact two weeks ago, when Pittsburgh was 7-4.



Even more unbelievable is the fact that no team with a winning record has ever experienced the low that the Steelers just did.



The loss also means that Pittsburgh is on the verge of bidding adieu to a playoff berth. Yes, the Steelers are still sitting at 7-6, and there are worse places to be in early December. However, they're trending in the wrong direction, and fast.



It's not hard to blame Pickett's injury, which he suffered against Arizona. However, the proverbial ship sprung its first alarming leak in Week 11, when the Steelers lost to the Cleveland Browns.

After Pickett was outplayed by fifth-round rookie and backup quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson, the team fired offensive coordinator Matt Canada.



""It's my role to absorb and protect those that I work with,"" head coach Mike Tomlin said, per ESPN's Brooke Pryor. ""This doesn't feel like that. I'm not assigning blame or deflecting in any way. ... Just rest assured that this decision was not taken lightly.""

The reality is that the offense wasn't good enough or creative enough with Canada calling the plays—not with standouts like George Pickens, Diontae Johnson, Jaylen Warren and Najee Harris in the lineup.



Tomlin did a fine enough job of keeping the team together, leaning on his defense and piecing together wins, but the offense needed to find a jolt if Pittsburgh wanted to be a serious contender.



Interim coordinator Eddie Faulkner and interim play-caller Mike Sullivan haven't been much better. They did help produce Pittsburgh's first 400-yard game in the Week 12 win over the Cincinnati Bengals—and their backup quarterback, Jake Browning—but the offense put a mere 16 points on the board.



That hasn't been the only issue, as the defense has started to show cracks over the past couple of weeks. Last week, the Cardinals physically imposed their will on Pittsburgh early and often. Arizona finished with 150 rushing yards, with former Steeler James Conner accounting for 105 of them and two touchdowns.

That game featured two lengthy weather delays that seemed to sap the fight from Pittsburgh. But it didn't have the same effect on Arizona.



On Thursday, Zappe spent the majority of the first half poking holes in the Steelers secondary.



Zappe, making only his second start of the season, finished the first half 14-of-21 for 196 yards and three touchdowns.



The Steelers did perform better in the second half, using a Mykal Walker interception and a blocked punt that set up a Trubisky rushing touchdown and a two-point conversion to climb within three points. That's as close as they would come.



The fight we saw from Pittsburgh in the second half is why this team can still make a push for the postseason. The lack of effort and slew of mistakes we saw last week and for most of the first two quarters on Thursday is why they might not.



Again, a Patriots team that scored 13 total points over the last three games scored 21 in the first half. That's simply too many points for a team with this many offensive issues to overcome.



For the moment, the Steelers have fallen below the 7-5 Browns, Houston Texans and Indianapolis Colts in the wild-card race. The playoff picture is currently as follows:



1. Miami Dolphins 9-3

2. Baltimore Ravens 9-3

3. Kansas City Chiefs 8-4

4. Jacksonville Jaguars 8-4

5. Cleveland Browns 7-5

6. Indianapolis Colts 7-5

7. Houston Texans 7-5

The 7-6 Steelers, 6-6 Denver Broncos, 6-6 Cincinnati Bengals and 6-6 Buffalo Bills are also in the mix. The Colts and Bengals play each other this week, but staying ahead of the other teams in the hunt is going to be a challenge for Pittsburgh.



The defense hasn't been consistent enough, and the offense continues to make baffling choices—Pickens was rarely targeted downfield and finished with 19 yards on five catches. Pickett's injury won't help matters. Neither will the neck injury No. 2 pass-rusher Alex Highsmith suffered on Thursday.



The road ahead is extremely daunting too. The Steelers have just one home game left, against the Bengals in Week 16. They'll visit the Colts next week and finish with road games against the Seattle Seahawks and Baltimore Ravens.



Every one of Pittsburgh's remaining opponents currently sits at .500 or better. Three of those games are on the road. If the Steelers can't beat teams like Arizona and New England at home, posting a winning record down the stretch feels unlikely at best.



Even if the Steelers go .500 the rest of the way, they'll finish at 9-8. That would maintain Tomlin's streak of not having a losing season, but nine wins probably isn't making the postseason.



Consider the fact that the Browns, Broncos, Colts and Texans all face remaining schedules that are easier than average over the final five weeks. At this point, the odds simply aren't in Pittsburgh's favor—and the Steelers have no one but themselves to blame.

190,NCAA Facing New Antitrust Lawsuit from Players Seeking Pay for Playing College Sports,"Mitchell Layton/Getty Images

The NCAA is reportedly facing another lawsuit.

According to Steve Berkowitz of USA Today, attorneys Steve Berman and Jeff Kessler filed a lawsuit against the NCAA and Power Five conferences on Wednesday. They represented Duke football player DeWayne Carter, Stanford women's soccer player Nya Harrison and TCU women's basketball player Sedona Prince.

The lawsuit was filed in an effort to challenge rules from the NCAA and conferences that prevent schools from directly paying players ""for their athletic services."" It also seeks ""substantial damages"" for football and basketball players at Power Five schools as an antitrust case.

Berman and Kessler are no strangers to filing lawsuits against the NCAA.

As Berkowitz noted, they oversaw the Alston antitrust case in which the Supreme Court ruled against the NCAA and lifted limits for benefits athletes can receive that are related to education. They are also involved in an ongoing case about limits to athletes making money from name, image and likeness.

What's more, they are involved in a case on behalf of former Oklahoma State football player Chuba Hubbard and former Oregon and Auburn track and field athlete Keira McCarrell that is looking to collect retroactive damages for thousands of college athletes. That case is based on the academic-achievement payments rule upheld in the Alston case.

The latest case says the NCAA and its schools ""have passed a byzantine set of rules prohibiting the extremely talented young men and women who generate billions of dollars for the Division I sports business from receiving any compensation for their athletic services beyond an athletic scholarship and certain types of education-related benefits.

""These draconian, collusive rules prohibit what the NCAA refers to as 'pay-for-play,' but what anyone else would call market-value compensation. In college sports, only the athletes are treated as 'amateurs.' Everyone else involved enjoys the compensation that results from unrestrained competition for the athletes' services.""

This comes after Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports and Nicole Auerbach of The Athletic reported Tuesday that NCAA President Charlie Baker issued a proposal that would allow for schools to directly pay athletes.

Baker proposed a Division I subdivision of schools that could directly pay players through NIL and trust funds, which stands in contrast to the current system that largely sees NIL handled by booster-led collectives.

Schools that opted into such a system would need to invest at least $30,000 per year per athlete into the trust fund, although there would be no cap as long as they followed Title IX rules with 50 percent going toward women's sports.","['athletic', 'ncaa', 'antitrust', 'case', 'athletes', 'womens', 'rules', 'facing', 'lawsuit', 'college', 'player', 'involved', 'seeking', 'players', 'pay', 'playing', 'schools']","According to Steve Berkowitz of USA Today, attorneys Steve Berman and Jeff Kessler filed a lawsuit against the NCAA and Power Five conferences on Wednesday.

191,What is fossil fuel phase-out? The outcome of COP28 could hinge on these small words,"CNN —

The thorniest issue at the global climate summit in Dubai is clear: Fossil fuels. More precisely, the role they should play in our rapidly warming future.

As negotiators thrash out the terms of core agreements that will emerge from COP28, the big question is whether countries will ultimately agree to a phase-out of oil, gas and coal, a phase-down — or neither.

The difference between phase-out and phase-down sounds like semantics, but the ability of the world to hold back catastrophic climate change may hinge on it.

While concrete definitions are hard to pin down, a phase-out generally means the world will at some point stop burning oil, gas and coal altogether and bring levels of planet-heating pollution down to zero.

A phase-down, however, leaves the door open for countries to continue burning fossil fuels.

It “can mean anything where the future level (of fossil fuel burning) is lower than today’s,” said Joeri Rogelj, a climate professor at Imperial College London. The word “implies a level of ambition that is less clear, and also less ambitious, than a phase-out,” he told CNN.

Tensions around the terms were heightened this week in the wake of newly surfaced comments made by COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, in which he claimed there was “no science” saying a phase-out of fossil fuels is necessary to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

He told reporters Monday that his comments were misinterpreted, and a fossil fuel phase-out was “inevitable” and “essential,” but the comments sent shockwaves through the summit.

More than 100 countries have pushed for the phase-out language, and dozens of scientists signed an open letter Wednesday stating that “the link between climate science and fossil fuel phase out is unequivocal.”

So, if the agreement lands on phase down, will that make it even harder to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius?

“In isolation, yes,” Rogelj said, “but words and context matter and it’s not black or white.” A text that agreed on a phase-down of all fossil fuels by 2050, for example, with specific targets for the decline of coal, oil and gas could be very positive, he said.

The devil will be in the detail, and even if the more ambitious phase down terminology is agreed, there’s another important word to account for: “unabated.”

The EU and the US, for example, have both called for a phase-out of “unabated fossil fuels.” This would mean an end to burning oil, gas or coal without capturing the planet-heating pollution before it escapes into the atmosphere, where it contributes to global warming.

The “abatement” refers to carbon capture and removal — a set of techniques that are being developed to remove carbon pollution from the air and to capture what’s being produced from power plants and other polluting facilities, then storing it or reusing it. Many scientists have expressed concern that carbon capture is expensive, unproven at scale and a distraction from policies to cut fossil fuel use.

The world has taken so long to cut emissions that scientific bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say a limited amount of carbon capture will be needed. It is likely to be required for certain sectors, such as agriculture and aviation, for which “zero emissions does not seem possible in the coming decades,” said Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate professor at the University of Exeter in the UK.

The question is, how much would be used and how effective would it need to be: If a fossil fuel plant captured 51% of its emissions, for example, would that be considered abatement?

The word “is meaningless without clear quality standards,” said Lisa Fischer, a program lead at climate think tank E3G.

The summit’s final agreement is expected around December 12, and experts are pushing for language to be precise, given the stakes.

Clarity is essential, Fischer said. “Ambiguity now doesn’t help anyone but the fossil fuel industry.”","['outcome', 'words', 'climate', 'phaseout', 'oil', 'fuels', 'gas', 'coal', 'small', 'phasedown', 'fossil', 'fuel', 'cop28', 'global', 'hinge']","CNN —The thorniest issue at the global climate summit in Dubai is clear: Fossil fuels.

192,"COP28: Fossil fuel industry has nearly quadrupled registrations at climate summit since last year, watchdog report says","CNN —

More than 2,400 people connected to the fossil fuel industry registered to attend the COP28 climate summit in Dubai — a massive representation that’s nearly four times the number that signed up for last year’s climate gathering, according to an analysis published Tuesday.

Fossil fuel employees and representatives outnumber every country’s delegation except for the United Arab Emirates, the host of COP28, and Brazil, according to the report from a coalition of corporate watchdog and climate advocacy groups, including Global Witness.

Overall attendance at the summit has also skyrocketed in recent years, with more than 80,000 people registered for the Dubai meeting — more than twice the number who registered for last year’s summit in Egypt. The report was not able to count how many fossil fuel representatives are actually in attendance, though it has shown registration numbers have been increasing over the years.

The findings are likely to fuel tensions at the already controversial climate summit, where the future role of fossil fuels, the main driver of the climate crisis, is shaping up to be one of the key sticking points.

COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, also an oil executive, has argued the fossil fuel industry should be involved in the summit.

“Let history reflect the fact that this is the presidency that made a bold choice to proactively engage with oil and gas companies,” he said during his opening remarks Thursday. CNN has reached out to the COP28 team for comment.

The analysis from the coalition, which this year organized under the name Kick Big Polluters Out, looked at the provisional list of COP participants to identify registrants with self-declared ties to fossil fuel companies or organizations with fossil fuel interests or foundations owned or controlled by a fossil fuel company.

It found an “unprecedented” 2,456 fossil fuel employees and representatives registered to attend COP28, significantly more than the 636 who signed up for COP27 in Egypt in 2022.

This year’s analysis was made easier by the United Nations’ decision in June that for the first time it would require fossil fuel lobbyists to disclose their affiliations when registering for the summit.

Fossil fuel employees and representatives received more passes to COP28 than all the delegates from the 10 most climate-vulnerable countries combined, according to the research.

“The hallways and negotiating rooms of this climate conference are flooded with the largest number of fossil fuel lobbyists ever,” said Lili Fuhr, director of the fossil fuel energy program at the Center for International Environmental Law.

Governments must “remain focused on delivering an outcome that supports and mandates a full phase out of fossil fuels while protecting public policy-making from fossil fuel interests,” she told CNN. “It remains our only chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 (degrees Celsius).”

Some scientists and advocacy groups have expressed increasing concerns about the ambition levels of the summit after recently resurfaced comments made by Al Jaber in the run up to COP28. In a recorded panel session last month, he told participants there was “no science” that said phasing out fossil fuels was necessary to meet the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.

After the remarks came to light on Sunday, Al Jaber fiercely defended his commitment to climate goals and science. At a news conference Monday, he told reporters his remarks had been misinterpreted and that a phase-down and phase-out of fossil fuels was “inevitable” and “essential.”

The number of fossil employees and representatives at COP summits has been increasing over the years, according to the annual report. Attendees connected to fossil fuel companies have attended COP summits at least 7,200 times over the last two decades, according to a KBPO report in November.","['according', 'climate', 'registrations', 'quadrupled', 'number', 'summit', 'watchdog', 'nearly', 'industry', 'fossil', 'fuel', 'cop28', 'report', 'registered', 'representatives']","The report was not able to count how many fossil fuel representatives are actually in attendance, though it has shown registration numbers have been increasing over the years.

198,Women say their farms were seized to build nickel mines amid Indonesia's electric vehicle boom,"This story is part of As Equals , CNN's ongoing series on gender inequality. For information about how the series is funded and more, check out our FAQs

(CNN) Masita rustles through the long grass, trying not to stumble as she points to another mountain in the distance. ""That all there used to be my land,"" she said. ""All gone.""

The mountain on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was once covered in thousands of pepper trees planted by her family, but all that's left is exposed red soil.

The 54-year-old said she didn't know her family was about to lose their livelihood -- her daughter phoned her at the market where she used to sell their harvest and said the trees had been destroyed.

""I climbed up to the hill and together my neighbors and I tried to stop the heavy equipment,"" recalled Masita, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name. When she tried to climb onto the machinery, she said the men tried to stop her and called the police.

She said she kept shouting, ""How could you, why did you do this to us, how can we live, how will we feed our families, should we eat stones?""

Masita, a former pepper farmer, looks over the land her family cultivated before it became a nickel mine.

Masita, along with her entire village in East Luwu regency, was evicted from the lands they were farming in 2015 so that a company could build a nickel mine, she said.

Like Masita, many Indonesian farmers do not have any clear land titles -- leading to land disputes and conflicts over territory. It's a problem made even more complicated by the fact that some regions on the national mapping appear uninhabited even if the land has been cultivated for generations.

Land in East Luwu was seized as part of Indonesia's push to become a world leader in the surging market for nickel, a crucial element long used in stainless steel. Extra demand has been created by the global push away from planet-heating fossil fuels toward renewable energy. Nickel is also used in lithium-ion batteries found in everyday objects like electric toothbrushes, laptop computers and cellphones. But those batteries are increasingly being used to power electric vehicles (EVs) and e-bikes.

The government's rush to expand its nickel processing and EV market has come at a cost to women like Masita who rely on pepper farms as their only source of income. Farming is one of the few industries available to women for jobs and economic opportunity.

Masita said she received a one-time payment from the mining company of around $50 million Indonesian rupiah (around $3,223) in exchange for the land. With the farm, the widow and mother of four could make up to 6 million rupiah (around $386) in one month from her year-round harvests. Now she's lucky to receive a quarter of that selling cooked food like chicken curry from her small stall in a nearby village.

""If we weren't evicted, we could have still earned millions of rupiahs. We're not rich people, but it's enough to cover our daily living costs,"" she said. ""Today, I borrow money from the bank ... My life has become difficult.""

Masita, a former pepper farmer, now sells meals from a small stall after her land was seized by a nickel mining company.

Indonesia's electric vehicle ambitions

Indonesian President Joko Widodo has mandated the development of the EV industry as a national priority, introducing EV-friendly policies and incentivizing tax breaks aimed at luring foreign investment.

In recent years, he banned the export of raw nickel ore to encourage the development of the country's own nickel processing facilities. Between 2015 and 2022, the value of Indonesia's processed nickel exports surged from $1 billion to an estimated $30 billion, according to Reuters.

Widodo has also mandated the development of Indonesia's own domestic EV industry, aiming to compete against Thailand and India as a viable alternative to China, which hopes to become the world's leading EV maker. With it comes an ambitious goal to produce 600,000 EVs by 2030.

Many of those vehicles are destined for overseas markets as countries aim to meet their national emissions targets by decarbonizing road transport, a sector that accounts for over 15% of global energy-related emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.

However, Indonesia's demand for nickel has meant farms, like Masita's in South Sulawesi, have been seized to support the expansion of nickel mining operations, smelting centers and refineries, as many don't hold formal land titles. Now others fear their farm could be the next to go.

Nurhasiyah, a pepper farmer living in the village of Loeha, also in East Luwu, started growing pepper trees as a young girl and continues to work on the farm with her husband so they can afford to send their three children to school.

""I can't imagine if our plantation were to be taken,"" Nurhasiyah said through tears. ""There would no longer be any livelihood for us.""

Nurhasiya, a farmer in Loeha, picks pepper berries from her plantation in the village of Loeha in East Luwu, Sulawesi.

She said representatives for PT Vale Indonesia, one of Indonesia's largest mining companies and the same company that now owns Masita's land, have started taking soil samples around the village in recent months, telling residents they purchased the land. ""Where is the proof of payment?"" she demanded.

CNN reached out to PT Vale Indonesia and the Indonesian government regarding the claims made by residents of East Luwu regency. It has not received a response from the government.

In an email to CNN, the company did not deny that land had been seized. It said it ""continues to undertake its operations and activities in accordance with its fundamental license to operate (known as its Contract of Work), and with prevailing laws and regulations, including in respect of land usage."" It said it faces ""significant instances of community encroachment by third parties, where land has been cleared for the purposes of community farming and unlawful mining activity"" in South Sulawesi.

In the past, it denied accusations it has seized land from indigenous people. ""PT Vale has never taken rights from other parties without their consent,"" Bayu Aji, PT Vale Indonesia's Head of Communication, told Indonesian magazine Tempo last year, saying it had acquired land in East Luwu through an agreement with the Indonesian government.

A history of controversial land grabs

In Indonesia, it's not unusual for residents to find property they've harvested for generations has been conceded by the government and sold to big businesses for natural resources.

For decades, human rights and environmental groups have accused Indonesia's government of land grabs, turning over rainforests and indigenous people's lands to large companies for the exploitation of resources such as palm oil.

Since assuming office in 2014, Widodo has sought to revitalize Indonesia's economy and support the development of industries reliant on natural resources, while at the same time pledging to slow deforestation and hasten the recognition of land ownership.

Last December, the government said it had recognized around 100 million parcels of land, which had been uncertified in 2015, and acknowledged that there are still 80 million people -- around 29% of the population -- who do not own land certificates.

This is our only source of life: pepper and land. Hasma, founder, ""Women Fighters of Loeha""

But activists say it's not enough and the process to have land recognized is slow and arduous. According to an independent initiative which maps indigenous lands, the Ancestral Domain Registration Agency (BRWA), the government has recognized 3.7 million hectares (9.14 million acres) -- or just 14% -- of land they've mapped claimed by indigenous groups, the environmental news nonprofit Mongabay reported.

In South Sulawesi, Nurhasiyah, along with dozens of other women, have joined the group ""Women Fighters of Loeha,"" fighting for the community's rights to their land.

Hasma, the group's founder, said pepper farming is a source of livelihood for the village's 7,000 residents and provides jobs to hundreds of others who work in the fields. If the farms were to be seized, their lives would be miserable, she said.

""This is our only source of life: pepper and land. If that is taken away, then we will have no other income,"" she said.

Hasma leads a gathering of the ""Women Fighters of Loeha"" to update the group on its efforts to protect their farms.

Women account for nearly a quarter of all farmers in Indonesia, with agriculture employing around 29% of the country's workforce, according to the World Bank. Many juggle the demands of taking care of their homes and children, while also tending to their farms, and are often more impacted than men by environmental changes.

Hasma said her group has sought help from with WALHI, the Indonesian Forum for Living Environment, Indonesia's oldest environmental NGO.

In a statement to the Group of 20 last year, then chaired by Indonesia, WALHI warned leaders to stop promoting electric vehicles as an ""environmentally friendly alternative and solution to the climate crisis.""

The statement called the expansion of nickel mining on Sulawesi ""a catastrophe for the community, especially farmers and women.""

In its joint communique, the G20 recognized the need for ""diversifying energy mixes and systems"" and ensuring ""clean, sustainable, just, affordable, and inclusive energy transitions,"" but made no mention of electric vehicles or the environmental impacts of nickel mining.

Muhammad Al Amin, executive director at WALHI South Sulawesi, says WALHI wants companies like PT Vale Indonesia to act fairly.

""This company has 118,000 hectares of concession land in South, Central and Southeast Sulawesi. If people ask for 20,000 hectares from the concession for their living space, I think this is a rational request,"" Al Amin told CNN.

Al Amin says that since the president declared he wanted Indonesia to be a major player in the electric vehicle industry, the organization had seen an increase in ""massive"" deforestation on Sulawesi.

As of 2022, South Sulawesi has lost 11% of its tree cover since 2000 with the greatest loss seen in East Luwu regency, according to Global Forest Watch , an initiative of the World Resources Institute.

""What the government never conveys is the impact of social and environmental damage that occurs around the industry,"" Al Amin told CNN. ""There are hundreds of families who are living in misery, living in poverty, due to the loss of their farms after being evicted by mining companies.""

And it's not just the loss of income. Masita says she and her family -- including her children and young grandchildren -- suffer from dust and noise pollution from the nickel mines. ""Often, we have to wear masks and glasses for protection,"" she said.

Nurhasiyah said residents in Loeha, which can only be accessed by ferry or through challenging rugged terrain, fear that environmental pollution from nickel mines will also leave them more vulnerable to sickness with limited to no access to medical centers.

We don't want the electric cars used every day to be made based on the suffering and cries of women. Muhammad Al Amin, executive director, WALHI South Sulawesi

CNN reached out to PT Vale Indonesia and the Indonesian government regarding these claims, but has not received a response from the government.

In its email to CNN, PT Vale Indonesia said it conducts environmental impact assessments and ""[we] ensure all decisions are well-communicated to stakeholders and community groups.""

On its global website, Vale says it recognizes its activities worldwide may cause ""significant environmental impacts"" and that it invests in ways to ""manage risks and minimize the socio-environmental impacts of our operations in the locations where we operate,"" as well as reduce pollutant emissions.

As the world moves toward electric vehicles to cut carbon pollution, the environmental group WALHI hopes consumers will be more aware of where the materials to make their cars come from and how they can play a role in pressuring companies and the Indonesian government to solve the conflicts.

""Green energy needs to be redefined. If green energy is obtained from activities that displace people's lands, displace people's farms, I don't think that's a green industry,"" Al Amin told CNN.

""We don't want the electric cars used every day to be made based on the suffering and cries of women in this village, built on the hunger and suffering of children in this village, and as a result of eviction.""

199,Almost half the men surveyed think they could land a passenger plane. Experts disagree,"Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.

CNN —

Picture this: you’re nestled comfortably in your seat cruising towards your travel destination when a flight attendant’s voice breaks through the silence:

“Ladies and gentlemen, both pilots are incapacitated. Are there any passengers who could land this plane with assistance from air traffic control?”

If you think you could manage it, you’re not alone. Survey results published in January indicate about one-third of adult Americans think they could safely land a passenger aircraft with air traffic control’s guidance. Among male respondents, the confidence level rose to nearly 50%.

Can a person with no prior training simply guide everyone to a smooth touchdown?

We’ve all heard stories of passengers who saved the day when the pilot became unresponsive. For instance, last year Darren Harrison managed to land a twin-engine aircraft in Florida – after the pilot passed out – with the guidance of an air traffic controller who also happened to be a flight instructor.

However, such incidents tend to take place in small, simple aircraft. Flying a much bigger and heavier commercial jet is a completely different game.

You can’t always rely on autopilot

A pilot spends about 90% of their time monitoring autopilot systems and making sure everything is working as intended. The other 10% is spent managing problems, taxiing, taking off and landing.

Takeoffs and landings are arguably the most difficult tasks pilots perform, and are always performed manually. Only on very few occasions, and in a handful of aircraft models, can a pilot use autopilot to land the aircraft for them. This is the exception, and not the rule.

For takeoff, the aircraft must build up speed until the wings can generate enough lift to pull it into the air. The pilot must pay close attention to multiple instruments and external cues, while keeping the aircraft centred on the runway until it reaches lift-off speed.

Once airborne, they must coordinate with air traffic control, follow a particular path, retract the landing gear and maintain a precise speed and direction while trying to climb.

Landing is even more complicated, and requires having precise control of the aircraft’s direction and descent rate.

To land successfully, a pilot must keep an appropriate speed while simultaneously managing gear and flap configuration, adhering to air traffic regulations, communicating with air traffic control and completing a number of paper and digital checklists.

Once the aircraft comes close to the runway, they must accurately judge its height, reduce power and adjust the rate of descent – ensuring they land on the correct area of the runway.

On the ground, they will use the brakes and reverse thrust to bring the aircraft to a complete stop before the runway ends. This all happens within just a few minutes.

Both takeoff and landing are far too quick, technical and concentration-intensive for an untrained person to pull off. They also require a range of skills that are only gained through extensive training, such as understanding the information presented on different gauges, and being able to coordinate one’s hands and feet in a certain way.

Not as easy as it looks. Jetlinerimages/E+/Getty Images

Training a pilot

The journey from student to commercial pilot is a long one. It normally starts with a recreational licence, followed by a private licence, and then a commercial licence (which allows them to fly professionally).

Even before stepping into a cockpit, the student must study aerodynamics, air law and flight rules, meteorology, human factors, navigation, aircraft systems, and performance and flight planning. They also need to spend time learning about the specific aircraft they will be flying.

Once the fundamentals are grasped, an instructor takes them for training. Most of this training is conducted in small, lightweight aircraft – with a simulator introduced briefly towards the end.

During a lesson, each maneuver or action is demonstrated by the instructor before the student attempts it. Their attempt may be adjusted, corrected or even terminated early in critical situations.

The first 10 to 15 lessons focus on takeoff, landing, basic in-flight control and emergency management. When the students are ready, they’re allowed to “go solo” – wherein they conduct a complete flight on their own. This is a great milestone.

After years of experience, they are ready to transition to a commercial aircraft. At this point they might be able to take off and land reasonably well, but they will still undergo extensive training specific to the aircraft they are flying, including hours of advanced theory, dozens of simulator sessions and hundreds of hours of real aircraft training (most of which is done with passengers onboard).

So, if you’ve never even learned the basics of flying, your chances of successfully landing a passenger aircraft with air traffic control’s help are close to zero.

Yet, flying is a skill like any other

Aviation training has been democratized by the advent of high-end computers, virtual reality and flight simulation games such as Microsoft’s Flight Simulator and X-Plane.

Anyone can now rig up a desktop flight simulator for a few thousand dollars. Ideally, such a setup should also include the basic physical controls found in a cockpit, such as a control yoke, throttle quadrant and pedals.

Flight simulators provide an immersive environment in which professional pilots, students and aviation enthusiasts can develop their skills. So if you really think you could match-up against a professional, consider trying your hand at one.

You almost certainly won’t be able to land an actual passenger plane by the end of it – but at least you’ll gain an appreciation for the immense skill pilots possess.","['control', 'flight', 'surveyed', 'men', 'aircraft', 'pilot', 'think', 'simulator', 'pilots', 'experts', 'disagree', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'training', 'air', 'half', 'plane', 'land']","Are there any passengers who could land this plane with assistance from air traffic control?”If you think you could manage it, you’re not alone.

200,Exclusive: Pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro cooperating in multiple state probes into 2020 fake electors plot,"CNN —

The pro-Trump lawyer who helped devise the 2020 fake electors plot and already pleaded guilty to the conspiracy in Georgia is now cooperating with Michigan and Wisconsin state investigators in hopes of avoiding more criminal charges, multiple sources told CNN.

In a dramatic turnaround from 2020 – when the lawyer, Kenneth Chesebro, was at the center of efforts by former President Donald Trump to subvert the Electoral College and overturn his defeat – Chesebro is now helping investigators in at least four states who are looking into the scheme.

Chesebro’s cooperation in Wisconsin is the first indication the state attorney general’s office has launched its own investigation into the false slates of pro-Trump electors. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, has not publicly announced that an investigation is underway.

Chesebro also recently testified to a grand jury in Nevada, where indictments against six fake electors were announced Wednesday by state prosecutors. Additionally, Chesebro has been in contact with prosecutors in Arizona, where he plans to sit for an interview as part of that state’s ongoing investigation into fake electors.

CNN has previously identified Chesebro as an unindicted co-conspirator in special counsel Jack Smith’s federal indictment against Trump, where the former president is charged with organizing the fake electors scheme “to disenfranchise millions of voters” and unlawfully remain in power. There is no indication Chesebro is cooperating in the federal probe, or that Smith has ruled out charges against him.

The Trump campaign targeted seven states with the scheme in 2020. Charges have been filed against fake electors in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada. Investigations are underway in Arizona, New Mexico and now, apparently, Wisconsin. The seventh state in the plot was Pennsylvania.

The Michigan inquiry, led by state Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, was the first in the nation to produce criminal charges. It now appears that the scope of Nessel’s investigation may be broader than previously known, and is looking at other figures with ties to the scheme beyond the fake electors themselves.

The Michigan attorney general’s office confirmed to CNN in an email this week that their investigation is still active.

The Wisconsin attorney general’s office declined to comment, as did Chesebro’s lawyer.

Chesebro has entered into what’s known as proffer agreements in several states, which gives him some protection from prosecution, according to multiple sources. His cooperation with investigators in Michigan and Wisconsin has not been previously reported.

But cooperating with state prosecutors does not guarantee Chesebro will avoid criminal charges in one or all of the ongoing investigations, the sources cautioned.

Another pro-Trump lawyer in Michigan

Nessel’s ongoing investigation has already produced charges against the 16 fake electors in Michigan. One agreed to cooperate in exchange for his case being dropped. The rest pleaded not guilty, and there are key hearings this month in their bid to toss the case.

Sources told CNN that Nessel has scrutinized another pro-Trump lawyer, Ian Northon, who was in contact with top Trump allies after the 2020 election and accompanied the fake electors when they tried to enter the Michigan statehouse.

In charging documents against the Michigan fake electors, prosecutors highlighted how Northon tried to persuade a state trooper to let them into the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing – but they were rebuffed. This was a key part of the plan that Chesebro and others devised: Federal law and Michigan statutes require the electors to meet in the statehouse, and Chesebro hoped the pro-Trump slate would hew to the law as closely as possible.

An attorney for Northon did not comment for this story.

After the 2020 election, Northon participated in conference calls with then-Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman where they discussed how to contest the results, according to Northon’s testimony to the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection.

Northon also had a phone call with Sidney Powell, a right-wing attorney and conspiracy theorist who has pleaded guilty in the Georgia election subversion case. She asked him to join a lawsuit she was filing in Michigan about nullifying the election – he declined and filed a separate suit contesting the results. The meritless cases went nowhere.

According to his congressional testimony, Northon had no ties to Chesebro, except that a colleague forwarded to him one of Chesebro’s memos about the Electoral College after the 2020 election. Northon also said he learned from a pro-Trump state legislator that the fake electors would be meeting in Lansing.

“I was as disappointed, I think, as anybody to see what happened on January 6 at the Capitol,” Northon told the House committee in 2022. “My efforts in representing these private clients were to get people to follow the law, not to encourage people to break it.”","['state', 'investigation', 'probes', 'multiple', 'electors', 'fake', 'plot', 'kenneth', 'attorney', 'chesebro', 'protrump', 'michigan', 'northon', 'wisconsin', 'exclusive', 'lawyer']","Chesebro’s cooperation in Wisconsin is the first indication the state attorney general’s office has launched its own investigation into the false slates of pro-Trump electors.

201,"Experts in concussion, NFL leaders gather to identify gaps in knowledge, offer guidelines on preventing brain injuries","CNN —

With growing attention on traumatic brain injury and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, in sports, clinicians and researchers from across the country, including doctors from the NFL, are offering guidance on how to prevent further harm in athletes.

Experts in athletic brain injury and long-term cognitive disorders gathered at a summit Friday at the Cantu Concussion Center at Emerson Health in Concord, Massachusetts, “to gather and share their findings, with a goal of identifying gaps in current research that need to be addressed,” according to a consensus statement from the group.

“The intent was to bring clinicians and researchers that work in this space together,” said Dr. Robert Cantu, medical director at Emerson Health’s Cantu Concussion Center and a pioneer in recognizing and treating concussions and traumatic brain injuries in professional and youth athletes. “Not everybody agrees on everything, but to inform us where we are together and where we’re not together, identify gaps of knowledge that we will then try to propose research that will close those gaps.”

The consensus statement laid out several recommended guidelines, including eliminating unnecessary contact to the head and neck areas during practice and games, and penalizing players for such contact.

“Having a collision sport or a contact sport doesn’t mean that that collision or contact has to involve the head,” said Dr. Allen Sills, chief medical officer of the National Football League and one of the organizers of the conference. “You can play a sport in which there is contact between or among players, but we should try to get the head out of that contact whenever possible.”

These guidelines have already been implemented within the NFL, Sills noted. Other medical advisers to the league also participated in the event, which was supported by an unrestricted educational grant from the NFL.

The conference consisted of three session focusing on the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury and CTE as well as concussion and repetitive traumatic brain injury prevention, and how to diagnose CTE in people who are living.

CTE has only been formally diagnosed with an autopsy in brain donors who were suspected of having the condition. Cantu noted a need to further identify how to define the criteria for CTE diagnosis.

“That was one of the areas where gaps in knowledge were most identified,” he said of the summit. “Many of the signs and symptoms of CTE or traumatic encephalopathy syndrome involved mood issues of depression, anxiety, panic attack that are prevalent not just in that syndrome but in many other conditions as well.”

The Alzheimer’s-like disease is most commonly associated with former professional football players but has also been detected in military veterans, including many who have been exposed to roadside bombs and other types of blasts.

CTE is pathologically marked by a buildup of tau protein in the brain that can disable neuropathways

Research has shown that repetitive hits to the head – even without a concussion – can result in CTE, which has been associated with memory loss, confusion, impulse control problems, aggression, depression, impaired judgment and suicidal behavior.

The summit participants also discussed the role of repetitive head impacts in the development of multiple diseases of the brain, spinal cord and nerves throughout the body.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Dr. Julie Stamm, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the summit, says it’s exciting to see a lineup of experts coming together to discuss not just CTE but other conditions related to traumatic brain injury.

“It’s not all about CTE,” she said. “Other diseases like Parkinson’s disease or Lewy body dementia have been linked to repetitive brain trauma. So including those in the conversation is also important because CTE clearly is a disease of concern, but these other diseases also need to be talked about.”

CTE is a major concern in the sports community, Stamm says, because the disease is now being diagnosed in younger athletes.

In a study of 152 athletes who died before the age of 30, published this year in the journal JAMA Neurology, researchers noted that 87 of the brain donors had died by suicide, including 33 who had CTE.

One of the donors was 18-year-old Wyatt Bramwell, who died by suicide in 2019. Bramwell is the first high school football player to be diagnosed with stage 2 CTE, according to researchers at the Boston University CTE Center.

This year, scientists in Australia also diagnosed the world’s first case of CTE in a professional female athlete, Heather Anderson, an Australian Football League player who was found to have low-stage CTE. She was 28 years old when she died by suicide last year.

Globally: The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide have contact information for crisis centers around the world.

Back in the states, CTE has been discovered in a number of NFL athletes. In a study earlier this year, Boston University’s CTE Center found that nearly 92% of 376 former NFL players whose brains were studied had CTE.

Sills says CTE is not an NFL issue but a public health issue.

“Everyone in this area can rally behind some of these basic principles around avoidance of head contact and how important it is to address that in practices and in games and work on the rules of play,” he said, adding that continued research is also needed to address differences of opinion on the matter.

“Science advances by having a theory and then testing that theory, and getting data that tests it, and then refining that theory and revising it and then retesting it, and that’s just the nature of scientific progress,” he said.

Cantu, the summit’s namesake, says the conference is just the beginning of a growing movement to address sport-related traumatic brain injuries.

“I think it’s quite a positive thing for the NFL, to have made this conference possible and bring all these individuals together. And I would hope other professional sports would follow that.”","['offer', 'traumatic', 'leaders', 'identify', 'knowledge', 'summit', 'injuries', 'cte', 'head', 'brain', 'nfl', 'including', 'preventing', 'contact', 'researchers', 'gather', 'suicide', 'gaps', 'guidelines']","Other medical advisers to the league also participated in the event, which was supported by an unrestricted educational grant from the NFL.

203,CNN poll: Large majority of US adults and half of Republicans agree with Biden’s goal to slash climate pollution,"CNN —

Nearly two-thirds of US adults say they are worried about the threat of climate change in their communities, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. More than half are worried about the impact of extreme weather, as the climate crisis touches every region in the form of extreme heat, devastating storms and drought.

Even more want the federal government to do something about it. A broad majority of US adults – 73% – say the federal government should develop its climate policies with the goal of cutting the country’s planet-warming pollution in half by the end of the decade.

That has been the goal of President Joe Biden, who has made tackling the climate crisis a greater priority than any other president, including through billions of dollars in tax subsidies to create more renewable energy infrastructure and help consumers buy discounted electric vehicles, solar panels and energy-efficient appliances. The Biden administration is also crafting and implementing several federal regulations designed to cut pollution from the oil and gas industry, power plants, and gas-powered vehicles.

The polling comes as nations debate the future of fossil fuels at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Vice President Kamala Harris announced at the summit last week that the US would commit another $3 billion to the global climate action fund, and the Biden administration announced new rules to slash emissions of methane – a powerful planet-warming gas – by 80% from the US oil and gas industry.

Cutting US climate pollution is a bipartisan aspiration, the CNN poll finds. Nearly all Democrats say the US should slash its greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030, and 76% of independents and half of Republicans agree.

American voters could be presented with a stark choice on how their country addresses climate change in the 2024 election; a potential rematch between Biden – who signed the country’s biggest climate investment into law last year – and former President Donald Trump, a climate change denier who has vowed to repeal several of Biden’s signature clean-energy policies.

When it comes to climate change, Americans say by a 13-point margin that their views align with Democrats more than Republicans. Much like abortion, climate change is one of the strongest issues for Democrats, CNN’s poll finds.

Americans give Biden a 43% approval rating for his handling of environmental policy, which is several points above his overall approval rating and well above his numbers for handling the economy. But few Americans, only 2%, see climate change as the most important issue facing the country, giving higher priority to the economy and cost of living.

But climate change and clean energy are increasingly intertwined with the economy. Climate change-fueled disasters don’t just impact commerce, they also strike at the heart of the American dream: homeownership.

In some states prone to wildfires and extreme weather, the cost of home and property insurance is skyrocketing. In some cases, insurance companies are dropping coverage all together because the risk is too high. That, in turn, has damaging implications for the housing market and cost of homes, experts have told CNN.

Most US adults say humanity bears a great deal of responsibility to try to reduce climate change but believe the US and Chinese governments and the energy industry are all doing too little to fix the problem.

Americans are also finding less fault with themselves: A somewhat lower 40% of Americans say that people like them hold a great deal of responsibility to reduce climate change. Meanwhile, 58% say that they, personally, are doing the right amount to reduce their impact on the climate crisis, with 37% saying that they are doing too little.

As past polls have found, there is a profound partisan divide over how Americans feel about climate change, and what to do about it, that outweighs other factors such as age and gender. The poll finds Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say that humanity bears a great deal of responsibility to reduce climate change (77% vs. 42%). And Democrats are 36 percentage points likelier than Republicans to say they’re very worried about the risk of climate change in the communities where they live.

But the fact that human activity is fueling the planet’s warming isn’t lost on Republicans; the poll finds about three-quarters of them think humanity has at least some responsibility to fight climate change.

The poll finds that more than 4 in 10 Americans say they’ve experienced extreme weather over the past year, with most in that group calling climate change a contributing factor. In the past few years, Americans have faced climate-fueled extreme heat, drought and flash flooding that has devastated communities.

The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from November 1-30 among a random national sample of 1,795 adults initially reached by mail. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.","['goal', 'pollution', 'climate', 'poll', 'slash', 'majority', 'americans', 'democrats', 'cnn', 'say', 'large', 'change', 'republicans', 'extreme', 'biden', 'half', 'responsibility']","CNN —Nearly two-thirds of US adults say they are worried about the threat of climate change in their communities, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.

204,"Maker of $32,000 lead poisoning antidote pledges to create assistance program to help uninsured patients afford drug","CNN —

Rising Pharmaceuticals, maker of a crucial drug for the most severe cases of lead poisoning, said it plans to start an assistance program to help uninsured and underinsured patients afford the medicine, which costs more than $32,000 for one course of treatment.

The company said it will introduce the program “soon,” after CNN reported Wednesday that it had priced its drug – approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in August – almost 10 times higher than an imported version from France.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, sent a letter to Rising’s CEO on Thursday, seeking answers about how the company reached the price and what effects it has on patient care.

Pediatric toxicologists said the cost of the medicine, called calcium disodium EDTA, can make it difficult for hospitals to stock, leading to potential delays of a few days in treating children with the most severe cases of lead poisoning. Although it’s very rare, when lead levels get extremely high, they can cause seizures, coma and brain swelling and can be life-threatening.

Rising said in a statement Friday that it “ensures the product is stocked at all national and regional wholesale outlets for rapid distribution to any hospital or clinic that has a patient in need” and said it “can be delivered the same day or overnight for same day or next day administration.”

The company said it also has a “free replacement program,” noting that because the drug is so rarely used, “a sizable portion of product manufactured and released each year will be returned for replacement and/or destroyed.”

Rising pointed out that “prior US companies stopped manufacturing and exited this product market due to the low volume and unsustainable economics of keeping it available.”

The French version of EDTA had a wholesale acquisition cost of $3,500 in the US, according to its maker, SERB’s BTG Pharmaceuticals. The FDA allowed importation last year after the drug went into shortage in the US in 2021. Its previous maker, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which subsequently changed its name to Bausch Health, had raised the price to almost $27,000 a course a decade ago before discontinuing the product following backlash.

Rising said it developed its version for reintroduction more than 10 years ago and said in its statement that it’s “committed to maintaining a US approved, US compliant product on the market to support practitioner and patient needs for the foreseeable future.”

Patient assistance programs can provide ways for drugmakers to cover some costs for patients when insurance doesn’t cover enough of the price of a medicine. Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said they “are a common way that pharmaceutical manufacturers have tried to quell concerns about their excessively high prices.”

Kesselheim, who also directs the Program on Regulations, Therapeutics and Law in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, noted that such programs can be helpful for some patients but said studies show that they often have restrictions about who qualifies and that they may be underused because patients don’t know about them or don’t want to provide sensitive information to drug companies.

He also pointed out that some programs cover only the patient’s out-of-pocket costs, while insurers still must pay for the majority of the drug’s cost, “which raises health care spending for everyone.”

“So patient assistance programs are not a sustainable, reliable solution to the issue,” Kesselheim said.","['lead', 'poisoning', 'product', 'pledges', 'program', 'uninsured', 'patients', 'maker', 'drug', 'medicine', 'cnn', 'programs', 'version', 'patient', 'price', 'help', 'create']","CNN —Rising Pharmaceuticals, maker of a crucial drug for the most severe cases of lead poisoning, said it plans to start an assistance program to help uninsured and underinsured patients afford the medicine, which costs more than $32,000 for one course of treatment.

207,Images from Gaza show Israeli soldiers detaining dozens of men stripped to underwear,"Jerusalem CNN —

Images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday showed a mass detention by the Israeli military of men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds, and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle.

The exact circumstances and dates of the detentions are unclear, but some of the detainees’ identities were confirmed by colleagues or family members.

Both the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hamas responded Friday to the images.

IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus told CNN the men pictured were “Hamas members and suspect Hamas members.” He said they were “without clothes in order to make sure they’re not carrying explosives.”

Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas’ political office, accused Israel in a statement of “kidnapping, invasive searches and disrobing” what he said was “a group of displaced Palestinian civilians.” He called it a “reprehensible crime” and urged human rights organizations to intervene.

At least some of the men are civilians with no known affiliation to militant groups, according to a CNN interview with one of their relatives and a statement by one of their employers, a news network.

The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor posted an image of one detainment and said in a statement on its website Thursday that “the Israeli army detained and severely abused dozens of Palestinian civilians.”

“Euro-Med Monitor received reports that Israeli forces launched random and arbitrary arrest campaigns against displaced people, including doctors, academics, journalists, and elderly men,” it said.

CNN has geo-located some of the images to Beit Lahia, north of Gaza City.

The Israeli media, without indicating a source, has portrayed the images as the surrender of Hamas members. A journalist asked IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari about the images during a news conference on Thursday, saying, “We’ve seen images of many captives, Hamas terrorists, that the IDF arrested during the ground maneuvering.”

Hagari said that, in fighting Hamas, “those left in the area gradually come out.”

“We investigate and check who has ties to Hamas, and who does not,” he said. “We arrest them all and question them. We will continue dismantling each one of those strongholds until we are done.”

On Friday, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy told CNN that men depicted in images of mass detentions in Gaza were all “suspected terrorists.”

Israeli forces were apprehending military-age men in areas of Gaza where they had been urging evacuation for more than a month, according to Levy, describing these areas as “Hamas strongholds.” Those who were not terrorists would be released, he said.

The men can be seen in the cargo bed of a military vehicle. Obtained by CNN

In an interview with CNN on Friday, Hani Almadhoun, director of philanthropy for the US arm of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA USA) said he knew a dozen people pictured in circulating images, including his brother.

“They’re neither fighters, they’re not surrendering, they’re just civilians who were there with their families trying to survive this,” Almadhoun told CNN’s Pamela Brown.

Almadhoun said the men he knew from his family had since been released, but described the situation as “baffling” to see his brother, a father and a shopkeeper, “dragged” from his home as a suspected Hamas combatant.

“My brother has seizures and they had him naked in the street and they put him on the beach in the winter, naked taking pictures of him, verifying who he is, and then they released him after they roughed him up a little bit,” he said.

“There is a lot of trauma from this for anybody who is watching, especially for my mom who has lost her son,” he said after describing how another brother and his family had recently been killed in an air strike. “You don’t recover from this. This is not just about justice, this feels like more about revenge.”

His family remained in northern Gaza instead of evacuating because they had nowhere to go in the south and had a family member killed in a safe zone, he added.

In a statement Thursday, news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed said that one of its correspondents and several members of his family were among those detained as part of the incident portrayed in the images.

It reported that Diaa Al-Kahlout was arrested by Israeli troops at gunpoint and forced to leave his disabled daughter behind, before he was allegedly stripped and beaten.

“Today, Thursday, the Israeli occupation army arrested the journalist and the director of ‘The New Arab’ office in Gaza, our colleague Diaa Al-Kahlot, from Market Street in Beit Lahia, along with a group of his brothers, relatives, and other civilians,” Al-Araby Al-Jadeed wrote.

“The occupation deliberately forced Gazans to take off their clothes, searched them, and humiliated them when they were arrested before taking them to an unknown destination, according to what the people there told us. Pictures and video clips spread showing soldiers arresting dozens of Gazans using criminal and humiliating method.”

Hussam Kanafani, the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed editor-in-chief, said in the statement that Al-Kahlot and his family were still missing.

“We will make every effort possible, in cooperation with international institutions and organizations concerned with the rights and freedom of journalists in the world, to determine the whereabouts of our colleague Diaa and release him as soon as possible,” Kanafani said.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was concerned by reports of Al-Kahlout’s arrest and called for his release.

“The Israeli army should disclose his location, release him immediately, and take steps to ensure the safety of all journalists covering this war, especially those in Gaza who face imminent harm,” CPJ Middle East and North Africa Program Coordinator Sherif Mansour said in a statement.

208,"Vladimir Putin, Russian president, says he will seek re-election in 2024","CNN —

Vladimir Putin says he will run for president again in Russia’s elections in March 2024, in a move that could see him retain power until at least 2030.

Putin made the announcement Friday after a ceremony at the Kremlin, the official residence of the Russian president.

Putin will bid for his fifth presidential term at the elections, set to take place on March 17, 2024, as he aims to solidify his continuous hold on power as head of state or prime minister for more than two decades.

The upcoming elections will also mark the first time that residents of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, annexed by Russia during the conflict, will participate in the presidential elections.

Russia’s Central Election Commission said it would organize “house-to-house voting” in those four regions over three consecutive days on March 15, 16 and 17.

The international community previously condemned local elections in these regions, organized by Russian-backed officials, as a sham.

Putin became acting prime minister of Russia in August 1999, before unexpectedly being handed the presidency by then-President Boris Yeltsin on New Year’s Eve of that year.

He served two four-year terms as president before stepping aside in 2008, as he was not constitutionally permitted to run for another presidential term. He endorsed Dmitry Medvedev, who replaced him as president, while Putin took the role of prime minister for a second time.

But he regained the presidency in 2012 and has not relinquished his grip on power since. After winning re-election in 2018, Putin then signed a law in 2021 which paved the way for him to run for two more six-year terms.

The changes to the law means that Putin, 71, could potentially extend his rule until 2036, by which time he will be in his mid-80s and his rule will be well into its third decade.

Putin is expected to face no more than token opposition in March. Under his authoritarian rule, opposition politicians have met similar fates: Exile, imprisonment or death in suspicious circumstances.

Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who posed one of the most serious political challenges to Putin during his rule, was sentenced in August to 19 years in prison on extremism charges. Navalny and his supporters claim his arrest was politically motivated, intended to silence his criticism of Putin.

Navalny was immediately detained upon returning to Russia in 2021. He had been taken from Russian to Germany in 2020, after he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok. Navalny arrived comatose at a hospital in Berlin, following a medical evacuation flight from the Siberian city of Omsk. A joint investigation by CNN and the group Bellingcat implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in Navalny’s poisoning.

Russia denies involvement in Navalny’s poisoning. Putin said in December 2020 that if Russian security services had wanted to kill Navalny, they “would have finished” the job.

Putin’s war in Ukraine, initially expected by Russia to last just a few weeks, will likely have entered its second year by the time presidential elections are held in March. While accurately gauging public opinion in Russia is difficult, the war is still thought to command broad support among the public, despite the costs it has placed on Russian society.

The Kremlin tries to keep the Russian population isolated from the worst of the conflict, but Ukraine has repeatedly attempted to bring the war home to Russia, launching its own strikes on cities across the country – including on the Kremlin itself.

Russia has kept the casualty numbers from its war in Ukraine shrouded in secrecy. In September 2022, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said 5,937 troops had been killed in the war. The ministry has not published an update since.

But western intelligence assessments put the toll much higher. Western intelligence assessments put the toll much higher. The United Kingdom defense ministry said in October it is likely that Russia has suffered between 150,000 and 190,000 permanent casualties, meaning killed or permanently wounded, since February 2022.

209,Australia swelters under extreme heat as rare early cyclone barrels toward northern coast,"CNN —

A tropical cyclone has rapidly intensified off the northern coast of Australia as millions across the country endure heat wave conditions that are forecast to stretch into the weekend.

Severe tropical cyclone Jasper strengthened to the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane Friday, with maximum winds of 220 kilometers per hour (138 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.



“Further intensification Friday is possible, and a category 5 system cannot be ruled out,” the country’s meteorology bureau said.

Jasper is the earliest Category 4 tropical cyclone to form in the Coral Sea since records began in 1900, according to CNN research of National Hurricane Center storm tracks.

The storm, which is located 1,195 kilometers (742 miles) northeast of Queensland and moving south at 9 kph (6 mph), could strike the coast near Cairns, a city of 250,000 people, with maximum sustained winds of 140 kph (87 mph) by early Tuesday.

However, forecasters say its projected path could change.

The storm’s arrival is unusually early during El Niño, a climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and generally reduces rainfall along Australia’s east coast.

The system has impacted weather all over the world this year and can particularly influence storm seasons.

Meanwhile, heat warnings are in effect in several states and territories, including New South Wales, home to more than 8 million people.

Temperatures in the NSW capital Sydney are expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) on Saturday, according to Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology, with the heat fueled by strong, dry winds.

Some schools in Sydney were forced to shut Friday and a total fire ban was in place in some parts of NSW, due to the increased risk of bushfires.

A “catastrophic” fire rating was issued in parts of South Australia on Friday, the highest on the scale, which indicates that lives and properties are likely to be lost if a fire starts.

Extreme fire danger ratings were in place in parts of New South Wales and Victoria.

The heat is forecast to weaken somewhat by the end of the weekend into early next week.

Australia is one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of the climate crisis, with frequent heat waves, extreme rainfall and devastating bushfires.

Earlier this year, more than 20 runners in the Sydney Marathon were hospitalized in a heat wave during Australia’s warmest winter since records began in 1910.

Ski resorts, including Perisher, the country’s largest, also closed early due to a lack of snow.

Fears were particularly high as memories of the catastrophic 2020 Black Summer fires – the country’s worst in decades – remain etched in the minds of millions of Australians.

The fires burned 10 million hectares (24.7 million acres), killing dozens of people and destroying more than 3,000 homes.","['storm', 'heat', 'rare', 'barrels', 'early', 'northern', 'cyclone', 'australia', 'sydney', 'mph', 'swelters', 'million', 'extreme', 'coast', 'south', 'parts', 'tropical']","CNN —A tropical cyclone has rapidly intensified off the northern coast of Australia as millions across the country endure heat wave conditions that are forecast to stretch into the weekend.

210,Italy quits Belt and Road plan as Europe rethinks China relations,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

Italy, the only G7 country to join China’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative, will leave the global infrastructure program when its contract expires next year - the latest sign of hardening European attitudes to Beijing and its global ambitions.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Thursday confirmed the widely expected move, a campaign pledge during her run for office last year amid complaints the deal signed with China by a previous government in 2019 had brought few benefits to Italy’s economy.

Meloni stressed however that Rome could maintain good ties with Beijing outside the program, which has expanded China’s global influence while raising concerns it has saddled some countries with unmanageable debt.

“I think that we should … improve our cooperation with China on trade, the economy,” Meloni told reporters, according to Reuters, in her first public comments on the issue after reports Italy had told China of its decision not to extend the pact after it expires in March 2024.

“The tool of the (BRI) … has not produced the results that were expected,” she added.

Italy’s move comes as the European Union has embarked on a campaign to “de-risk” its supply chains from China’s and secure sensitive technologies after the bloc deemed Beijing a “systemic rival” in 2019.

Those frictions were on show Thursday during a summit between EU heads and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing, where the two sides grappled with points of contention from trade to Russia’s war in Ukraine - with little concrete progress made.

China’s Foreign Ministry took a measured tone when asked about the Italian withdrawal during a regular press briefing Thursday, pointing to the “enormous appeal and global influence of Belt and Road cooperation.”

“China firmly opposes attempts to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation or stoke bloc confrontation and division,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, without referring directly to Italy.

‘Wicked’ decision

China has inked agreements with what it says are more than 140 countries for partnership on the program, which has funneled hundreds of billions of dollars into roads, ports, airports and bridges, largely across the Global South over the past decade.

Italy’s decision to join the scheme in 2019 was widely seen at the time as a diplomatic win for Beijing – and drew criticism from Washington and Brussels.

In an interview with newspaper Corriere della Sera this summer, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto branded the 2019 decision as “wicked,” citing growing trade imbalances between the two countries.

China imported $26.9 billion in Italian goods last year, compared with $21.4 billion in 2019. By contrast, Chinese exports to Italy rose to $50.5 billion from $33.5 billion over the same period, according to China’s customs data.

Rome joined the scheme under former China-friendly Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who condemned the withdrawal in an interview posted to his Facebook page, saying it was made for “ideological reasons” and risked “scuppering” potential expansion of Italian exports.

Chinese Ambassador to Italy Jia Guide earlier this year in an interview with Italian news outlet Fanpage suggested a “reckless” decision to withdraw from the pact would have a “negative” impact on cooperation.

Italian leaders have appeared keen to navigate the withdrawal carefully, with Meloni repeatedly suggesting it was possible to have good relations with China outside the Belt and Road plan. She has also previously denied speculation that the United States pressured her to quit the scheme.

EU meeting in Beijing

The news of Rome’s withdrawal came as the delegation of top European Union officials arrived in Beijing for the first in-person EU-China summit in four years.

The meeting was seen by Chinese leaders as a key opportunity to smooth contentious relations with Europe, which Beijing continues to see as a key potential counterweight in its competition with the United States.

“We should not view each other as rivals just because our systems are different, reduce cooperation because competition exists, or engage in confrontation because there are disagreements,” Xi told the visiting leaders, according to China’s official readout.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel pressed Xi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang on the gaping trade deficit between their economies and “unfair competition,” while Li urged the EU to be “prudent” in its use of “restrictive” economic policies.

Though the summit appeared to do little to resolve key issues, Von der Leyen said it saw both sides agree “that it is in our joint interest to have balanced trade relations.”

The EU side would be looking for “concrete progress following these discussions,” the bloc said in a statement after the meeting.","['chinas', 'belt', 'italian', 'europe', 'relations', 'road', 'european', 'italy', 'trade', 'china', 'withdrawal', 'global', 'beijing', 'plan', 'quits', 'rethinks']","Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

211,UPenn President Liz Magill under fire over her testimony on antisemitism: ‘An utter disgrace’,"New York CNN —

The growing chorus of donors, politicians, business leaders and other prominent figures calling for the immediate ouster of University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill has reached a crescendo after her disastrous testimony at a House hearing earlier this week.

During Tuesday’s House hearing, Magill, along with the presidents of Harvard and MIT, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

Magill had already been under fire prior to Tuesday’s hearing after multiple incidents of antisemitism on campus in recent months – and what critics have said was a tepid response to those incidents.

After the fallout from Tuesday’s hearing, Magill attempted to clarify her message on Wednesday, posting a video on X in which she said she should have focused on the “irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate.”

Magill said Wednesday that Penn’s policies “need to be clarified and evaluated,” adding that in her view: “It would be harassment or intimidation.”

Harvard University president Claudine Gay has apologized for her comments in an interview with the student newspaper Thursday.

“I am sorry,” Gay said to The Harvard Crimson. “Words matter.”

But Magill has not apologized. Penn’s stakeholders remain unsatisfied. Here is who is calling for Magill to resign:

A bipartisan group of more than 70 members of Congress on Friday sent a letter to board members of Harvard, MIT and Penn demanding Magill and her counterparts at the other two universities be dismissed.

“Given this moment of crisis, we demand that your boards immediately remove each of these presidents from their positions and that you provide an actionable plan to ensure that Jewish and Israeli students, teachers, and faculty are safe on your campuses,” the lawmakers wrote.

“The university presidents’ responses to questions aimed at addressing the growing trend of antisemitism on college and university campuses were abhorrent,” the lawmakers added.

Former US Ambassador Jon Huntsman Thursday night called on Penn’s board of trustees to remove Magill.

“Let’s make this great institution shine once again,” Huntsman said in a statement shared exclusively with CNN on Thursday evening. “We are anchored to the past until the trustees step up and completely cut ties with current leadership. Full stop.”

Huntsman, the former governor of Utah, was a 1987 graduate and former UPenn trustee. In October, he blasted Penn’s response to antisemitism on campus and promised to halt his family’s donations to the university. The Huntsman family has been such prominent supporters of UPenn that the Huntsman name is on the main Wharton School building.

Now, Huntsman is going further, calling for a complete leadership change.

“At this point it’s not even debatable,” Huntsman said. “Just a simple IQ test.”

Stone Ridge Holdings CEO Ross Stevens, a major donor to Penn, sent a letter on Thursday to Penn threatening to take steps that would cost the Ivy League school approximately $100 million if Magill stays on as president.

Stevens, a Penn alum and CEO of Stone Ridge Holdings, argues he has clear grounds to rescind $100 million worth of shares in his company that are currently held by Penn. He specifically cites Magill’s disastrous testimony before Congress earlier this week.

“Absent a change in leadership and values at Penn in the very near future, I plan to rescind Penn’s Stone Ridge shares to help prevent any further reputational and other damage to Stone Ridge as a result of our relationship with Penn and Liz Magill,” Stevens said in a note to his employees on Thursday obtained by CNN.

The Wharton Board of Advisors, comprised of a powerful group of business leaders, including NFL owner Josh Harris, former Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky, Related Companies CEO Jeff Blau, Blackstone exec David Blitzer and BET CEO Scott Mills, has called for Magill’s immediate ouster.

“As a result of the University leadership’s stated beliefs and collective failure to act, our Board respectfully suggests to you and the Board of Trustees that the University requires new leadership with immediate effect,” the Wharton Board of Advisors wrote in a letter sent directly to Magill.

The letter, which appears to have been sent Wednesday, specifically cites Magill’s testimony.

Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, called the testimony “catastrophic and clarifying” and said Magill’s attempt to clean-up her testimony “looked like a hostage video, like she was speaking under duress.”

“I understand why the governor of Pennsylvania and so many of the trustees don’t have confidence in her. I don’t have confidence anymore that Penn is capable, under this leadership, of getting it right,” Greenblatt told CNN’s Kate Bolduan, adding that he has spoken with Magill.

Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Thursday said she agrees with calls for the presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania to resign, arguing they are “failing in the worst way.”

“Their statements were abhorrent,” Gillibrand told Fox News, referring to Tuesday’s hearing in the House. “Trying to contextualize what constitutes harassment? Jewish students are terrified on these campuses.”","['huntsman', 'disgrace', 'penns', 'liz', 'ceo', 'board', 'hearing', 'upenn', 'university', 'utter', 'penn', 'president', 'tuesdays', 'testimony', 'leadership', 'antisemitism', 'magill']","During Tuesday’s House hearing, Magill, along with the presidents of Harvard and MIT, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment.

212,Diphtheria: West Africa battles worst outbreak in recent times,"CNN —

In Nigeria’s northern state of Kano, doctors and health workers are grappling with one of the worst diphtheria outbreaks in recent times.

Cases have been reported in the country since May of last year, but in the past few months, the outbreak has spread at an alarming rate, health officials say. Local, federal, and international bodies have struggled to contain the bacterial disease, with 17,000 suspected cases in Nigeria so far.

Worryingly, the outbreak has now spread to other West African countries such as Niger and Guinea and Medecins San Frontieres (MSF) says these nations are currently facing some of the most severe outbreaks of this vaccine-preventable disease ever documented on the continent.

However, the epicenter remains Kano, MSF health workers told CNN. So far, they have confirmed 9,310 cases and 368 deaths this year.

At its peak, MSF in Kano reported up to 700 cases a week. This rate dropped in September, but cases are slowly starting to rise again, currently at 500 weekly.

A bacterial disease

Diphtheria is a bacterial disease that creates a toxin that kills tissues and attacks cells in the respiratory system, making it hard for patients to breathe and swallow. If the toxin enters the bloodstream, it can damage the nervous system, and cause heart and kidney damage or paralysis, even after recovery, according to an MSF explainer on the disease.

Murjanatu Muhammad, a 30-year-old from Kano, has seen all of her children, 10-year-old Mohammed, eight-year-old Fatima, and twins Jamila and Husseina, aged five, admitted to hospital with diphtheria.

“You can imagine if we didn’t bring these children early enough, we don’t know what would have happened to them,” she told CNN.

For another mother, Firdausa Salisu, her son Auwal Nura has been sick since he was born four years ago and was receiving treatment from a traditional healer who advised against vaccines, his mother said.

“The traditional medicine man that was treating him advised that he should not be vaccinated at the time. By the time he recovered and I wanted him to be vaccinated, I was told he was past the age of receiving the vaccines.”

High mortality in children

Thousands of children like Auwal have experienced the alarming range of symptoms caused by diphtheria, says Dr. Hashim Juma.

Dr. Juma, with over 20 years of experience in the field, is currently based in Kano working as the emergency medical coordinator for MSF.

“This is very serious. Patients come in vomiting blood, paralysis in the legs… there is high mortality, particularly with children.” Dr. Hashim Juma, Medecins Sans Frontieres.

“Never have I ever faced this outbreak, in terms of the number of people infected, the mortality, and the complications as well,” he told CNN via a phone call from Kano.

“There are many diseases with complications, but this is very serious. Patients come in vomiting blood, paralysis in the legs… there is high mortality, particularly with children.”

Medical workers have been struggling to treat patients effectively, partly due to a lack of diphtheria anti-toxins (DAT).

So far, MSF says it has only been able to provide 5,000 DAT doses to patients.

With each severe case requiring eight to 10 vials each, this remains far from enough to support those who need it. Without treatment, patients face a roughly 50% chance of death, which reduces to a 5% chance if treated, Dr. Dagemlidet Tesfaye Worku, emergency medical program manager for West and Central Africa at MSF told CNN.

DAT doses and antibiotics are particularly hard to come by due to the lack of production, as well as the cost and time needed to manufacture.

A vial of diphtheria anti-toxin is prepared by a doctor at the treatment center in Kano Georg Gassauer/Medecin San Frontieres

Dr. Dagemlidet says that only three companies produce these doses, two of whom are approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).

He added that manufacturers need four weeks to make one batch of 1,500 DAT doses, and treating patients could cost up to 350 Euros ($370) from DAT alone. He believes this needs to change as soon as possible.

“In the short term, we need to improve production capacity of anti-toxins. Long term, we need to invest in research and development,” Dr. Dagemlidet says.

“It’s a global health crisis… in our globalized world, an outbreak can happen here, or in an urban area somewhere else. Global health security is so important.”

Vaccine mistrust

Vaccination has also played a crucial role in this ongoing outbreak. Whilst some vaccine uptake has helped prevent infections, there are a number of barriers from increasing uptake.

As of November, only 30% of patients in Kano had full vaccine protection, according to MSF. This rate is at its lowest in the northwestern state of Sokoto at just 6%. In response, WHO and UNICEF have started a vaccination campaign across 14 states in Nigeria.

Dr. Juma explains that in Kano there is mistrust and lack of awareness surrounding vaccines. He says: “There is a vaccine hesitancy here. People have had a bad experience with the side effects before. During our first intervention, we could see people were not highly welcoming to the vaccine team.”

The lack of vaccination coverage also applies to the rest of West Africa, with 65% of diphtheria patients having never received a single vaccine dose.

In late November, WHO published an updated explainer on diphtheria, emphasizing the importance of high vaccine uptake to tackle the outbreak. The organization recommends six vaccine doses to babies at six weeks old to provide long-term protection.

GAVI, a vaccine alliance programme, also announced on December 4 that eligible countries can now apply to implement diphtheria vaccines into their health programs.

As the outbreak has escalated since July, Dr. Juma has seen vaccine uptake improve. In order to contain this surge of diphtheria, and help prevent future outbreaks too, this trend must continue.

With the disease now present in neighboring Niger, there is concern that once again the population is not adequately equipped. Dr. Juma says that there is little to no vaccination coverage there, a great concern considering the high level of movement between Kano and Niger.

In order to address the outbreak, the message is clear. Vaccination must improve. Dr. Juma says: “We stress the need to make the routine vaccination system stronger and stronger… then you can control the outbreak.”

Lessons have also been learned regarding doses of antitoxins and antibiotics, explains Dr. Dagemlidet. He says: “We need to have at least a minimum quantity of anti-toxins in each country, so when the first cases happen, adequate resources are available to help local areas.

“The best way of responding to emergencies is anticipation and prevention.”","['juma', 'outbreak', 'worst', 'patients', 'recent', 'vaccine', 'diphtheria', 'kano', 'africa', 'msf', 'dr', 'health', 'battles', 'need', 'west', 'times']","CNN —In Nigeria’s northern state of Kano, doctors and health workers are grappling with one of the worst diphtheria outbreaks in recent times.

213,"Live updates: Israel-Hamas war, US vetoes UN resolution calling for Gaza ceasefire","Images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday showed a mass detention by the Israeli military of men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle. Obtained by CNN

The Israeli military is apprehending military-aged men in northern Gaza to “work out who the terrorists are,” the Israeli Government spokesperson told CNN on Friday.

Eylon Levy was responding to questioning from CNN’s Brianna Keilar about images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday, which showed men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds, and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle.

“When we find military-aged men in areas that we have been urging an evacuation of for over a month – because these are Hamas strongholds where we have seen intense urban fighting – we need to apprehend those people, work out who the terrorists are,” Levy said.

Those who are determined not to be “terrorists” will be released, he added.

At least some of the men detained as part of the operation depicted in the social media images were civilians with no known affiliation to militant groups, according to a conversation CNN had with one of their relatives and a statement by one of their employers, a news network.

The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said Friday that dozens of suspects arrested by Israel in Gaza had been taken to Israeli territory for questioning.

“The people we’re seeing in these images are all suspected terrorists,” Levy said.

“We wish that all Hamas fighters were wearing uniforms that clearly said Hamas on their helmets, because that would make them easier to identify them. But when Hamas dresses up as civilians, and fights within civilian areas, they make it very difficult to find them.”

Some context: The Israeli military for weeks told Gazans to leave northern Gaza, and head south. Now that the Israeli military has invaded southern Gaza, it has told Gazans to head for a small strip of land in southwestern Gaza, along the Mediterranean coast.

But the main UN agency working in the Palestinian territories, UNRWA, says there is no such thing as a “safe zone” in Gaza. “The entire Gaza Strip has become one of the most dangerous places in the world,” it said in a statement. “There is nowhere to go as shelters, including UNRWA, are overflowing.”

Over 1.9 million Gazans, or 85% of the population are internally displaced, according to The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.","['calling', 'updates', 'live', 'israelhamas', 'israeli', 'men', 'terrorists', 'hamas', 'ceasefire', 'military', 'images', 'war', 'resolution', 'gaza', 'told', 'strip', 'vetoes', 'social']","Obtained by CNNThe Israeli military is apprehending military-aged men in northern Gaza to “work out who the terrorists are,” the Israeli Government spokesperson told CNN on Friday.

214,US State Department asks Congress to approve sales of tank munitions to Israel,"CNN —

The US State Department has asked Congress to approve a sale of tens of thousands of munitions for Israeli tanks, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN.

The request, which the source said was received within the last week and is being reviewed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is for 45,000 shells for Israeli Merkava tanks, the source said. The source added that the committees are under “pressure” from the State Department to approve the request quickly amid Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.

The request comes as the US is under growing domestic and international pressure to support a ceasefire in Gaza, and place conditions on some of the weapons it is providing to Israel.

“As a matter of policy, we do not confirm or comment on proposed defense transfers or sales until they have been formally notified to Congress,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN when asked about the request.

Reuters first reported the request.

In early November, the State Department formally notified congressional leaders that it would be transferring $320 million worth of precision-guided bomb equipment to Israel, CNN previously reported.

Israel has received 200 cargo planes of military equipment from “several countries” since the Hamas terror attack on October 7, including ammunition, armored vehicles, and weapons, according to the Israeli Ministry of Defense.

The Israeli ministry said more than 10,000 tons of military equipment have been delivered since the start of the war.

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense said the aid had come from “several countries,” but declined to say what other countries had sent aid or how much of it had come from the United States.

The shipments of US military aid began soon after the war began. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was in Israel on October 13 as a C-17 cargo plane landed with security assistance to Israel.

“There’s a lot more that follows this,” Austin said at the time.

Unlike security assistance to Ukraine where the US details types of weapons and capabilities, the shipments to Israel have been far more discrete, with the Defense Department rarely acknowledging or announcing what types of weapons or equipment it is sending.

In late-October, a senior defense official said the US was expediting the delivery of precision-guided joint direct attack munitions (JDAMs) to Israel, which turn unguided bombs into smart weapons. The US has also expedited the delivery of Iron Dome interceptor missiles for Israel’s primary aerial defense system.

The use of US weapons in Israel’s ongoing war has drawn increased scrutiny following an Amnesty International report this week which claimed that US-made JDAMs were used in two strikes in October which killed 43 civilians. The human rights organization said it “did not find any indication that there were any military objectives at the sites,” a conclusion the Israeli military rejected as “flawed, biased and premature.”

The US State Department and the Defense Department both said they are reviewing Amnesty International’s report.

“We have made clear in our discussions with Israeli leaders that we are deeply concerned about the protection of civilians in this conflict,” State Department spokesman Matt Miller said Wednesday. “We expect Israel to only target legitimate targets and to adhere to the laws of armed conflict.”

215,"Israeli tank fire killed Reuters journalist in October attack, CNN analysis suggests","CNN —

Israeli tank fire killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and injured six other international journalists in a double strike in southern Lebanon on October 13, forensic analysis by CNN suggests, confirming reports by two news organizations and two human rights groups.

On Thursday, Reuters, AFP, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch released investigations into the circumstances of the deadly strike. AFP and HRW claimed the strike was a “deliberate,” targeted attack by Israel on the journalists. In a statement to Reuters, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Richard Hecht said: “We don’t target journalists.” He did not provide further comment, the news agency reported.

The Israel Defense Forces on Friday said that the October incident in which a Reuters journalist was killed is still “under review.”

AFP photographer Christina Assi had her leg amputated and remains in the hospital as a result of the strike, according to AFP.

Eylon Levy, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, said Thursday that he was “not familiar” with the new reports. “The guiding principle in Israel’s campaign against Hamas is we uphold the principles of international law regarding proportionality, necessity, distinction,” he said. “We target Hamas, we do not target civilians.”

CNN’s forensic analysis of multiple videos, including a live AFP video feed from the time and place of the attack, has determined that the two strikes – 37 seconds apart – that hit the journalists was a supersonic event that came from the direction of Israel.

Israel and Hezbollah were engaged in intense crossfire across the Lebanon-Israel border at the time.

CNN has also seen a photo from the scene of the attack showing the tail fin of a 120 mm tank shell. The photo was verified by a source familiar with the investigation.

Neither the Lebanese army nor the Iran-backed Hezbollah are known to have such ammunition in their arsenal.

“That is a 120mm high explosive tank shell. Very clearly high explosive and not a different type of shell,” said Marc Garlasco, a former defense intelligence analyst and UN war crimes investigator, who saw the photo obtained by CNN as well as video of the aftermath of the attack. “(Aftermath video is) very indicative of a direct fire munition and matches with the 120 fragments.”

“The shooter should have seen the journalists from the tank,” he added.

British weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith said the photograph of the remnants of the shell clearly showed an “expended tank round.”

“Two projectiles hit the area of the media crews and from the damage to the wall, the location where Issam’s body ended up and from an analysis of the second crater, I believe the shots came from the area of the high ground just over the border,” said Cobb-Smith, referring to a foot-high wall seen in aftermath video near Abdallah’s body. Cobb-Smith said his analysis of the damage left by the projectile suggested that the attack came from a southeasterly direction.

CNN also consulted with audio expert Robert Maher, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University.

Maher determined that the attack was likely a “supersonic event” due to the absence of an “approaching whoosh or whine, as you might see with artillery fire.”

Cobb-Smith’s theory that the shells travelled from the southeast would be consistent of the findings of the investigations released Thursday.

Hours after the attack on October 13, CNN reported that the journalists attacked were wearing clearly labelled press flak jackets. It also reported that an Israeli Apache helicopter was seen over the site of the attack around the time of the attack, according to a Lebanese security source, which would have given Israeli forces added visibility over the journalists.

Israeli surveillance towers are seen in video of the attack, raising further doubt that Israel had not realized the tank crew was attacking journalists.

‘Under review’

In its statement Friday, the IDF said, “On October 13, 2023, the terrorist organization Hezbollah launched an attack on multiple targets within Israeli territory along the Lebanese border,” the IDF said in a statement. “One incident involved the firing of an anti-tank missile, which struck the border fence near the village Hanita.”

CNN reported that exchange of fire at the time of the incident.

“Following the launch of the anti-tank missile, concerns arose over the potential infiltration of terrorists into Israeli territory. In response, the IDF used artillery and tank fire to prevent the infiltration. The IDF is aware of the claim that journalists who were in the area were killed,” the statement continued.

“The area is an active combat zone, where active fire takes place and being in this area is dangerous. The incident is currently under review,” the IDF said.

IDF spokesperson Richard Hecht on October 14 called Abdallah’s death “a tragic thing,” without naming him directly or acknowledging Israel’s involvement. The same day, the IDF said: “A report was received that during the incident, journalists were injured in the area. The incident is under review.”

Speaking Thursday in Washington, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Abdallah’s death should be investigated. Blinken said it was his understanding that Israel had begun such an investigation and stressed the importance of seeing it through.

A Pentagon spokeswoman said earlier that the agency had not conducted its own assessment of Abdallah’s death but it continued to urge Israel to protect innocent civilians, including members of the press.

Al Jazeera has accused Israel’s military of “deliberately targeting the journalists to silence the media,” saying the attacks are a part of “a pattern of ‘repeated atrocities’ against journalists.”

The Committee to Protect Journalists also said the results of the investigations by Reuters, AFP, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch were in alignment with its own findings that show a “pattern of lethal force” by the Israeli military against journalists over the past 22 years.

The press freedoms group had documented at least 20 journalist killings by the IDF since 2001, it said in a report released May 2023. “The vast majority – 18 – were Palestinian. No one has ever been charged or held accountable for these deaths,” the report said.

‘Deliberate and targeted’

Amnesty International’s investigation did not find “any indication that there were any fighters or military objectives at the site of the strikes.”

“Israeli forces had observation towers, ground elements, and air assets deployed to closely monitor the border. All of this should have provided sufficient information to Israeli forces that these were journalists and civilians and not a military target,” Amnesty said in its report.

“Our investigation into the incident uncovers chilling evidence pointing to an attack on a group of international journalists who were carrying out their work by reporting on hostilities. Direct attacks on civilians and indiscriminate attacks are absolutely prohibited by international humanitarian law and can amount to war crimes,” said Aya Majzoub, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.

“The strikes were deliberate and targeted,” AFP said in its report. AFP global news director Phil Chetwynd said in the report, “AFP has been very clear that we will take all judicial avenues that we deem relevant and possible to ensure that we can get justice for Christina and Issam.”

Dylan Collins, a journalist with AFP who survived the attack, told CNN it was “hard not to see it as a deliberate strike.”

Collins, AFP’s Lebanon/Syria video coordinator, recounted what started as a “pretty quiet day,” describing how teams of Reuters and AFP journalists, all wearing flak jackets, helmets with press written across them, moved toward a plume of smoke after hearing “loud bangs” along the Lebanon-Israel border.

“The Israelis had drones in the air the entire time. And I imagine you know with their state-of-the-art surveillance capabilities, they could see our faces, they probably knew which channels we were working for… At around 6:02 that evening, we were struck directly,” Collins added.

“It was two strikes 37 seconds apart, almost in the same exact location on a group of journalists, seven journalists all wearing press vests and helmets,” Collins said.

The AFP journalist paid tribute to Abdallah, describing him as the “beating heart of the press scene” in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

Speaking of AFP colleague Assi, who sustained “devastating” injuries from the strikes, Collins said, “she’s bled more than any human should bleed.”","['israeli', 'video', 'analysis', 'international', 'idf', 'israel', 'suggests', 'tank', 'cnn', 'journalist', 'attack', 'journalists', 'afp', 'incident', 'killed']","CNN —Israeli tank fire killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and injured six other international journalists in a double strike in southern Lebanon on October 13, forensic analysis by CNN suggests, confirming reports by two news organizations and two human rights groups.

216,Al-Nasr hospital: Infants found dead and decomposing in evacuated Gaza ICU. Here’s what we know,"Editor’s Note: The following story includes graphic material. Audience discretion is advised.

CNN —

The scene inside the Al-Nasr hospital ICU ward is chilling. The tiny bodies of babies, several still attached to wires and tubes that were meant to keep them alive, decomposing in their hospital beds. Milk bottles and spare diapers still next to them on the sheets.

The video inside the hospital was filmed on November 27 by Mohamed Baalousha, a Gaza reporter for UAE-based news outlet Al Mashhad. He shared an unblurred version with CNN, which shows the remains of at least four infants.

Three of them appear to be still connected to hospital machines. The bodies of the babies appear to be darkening and disintegrating from decay, with little more than skeletons left in some of the beds. Flies and maggots are visibly crawling across the skin of one child.

The circumstances around one of the most horrifying videos to emerge from the war in Gaza remain unclear, but after days of piecing together available information, using interviews, published statements and video, a chaotic scene can been painted of hospital staff trying to protect their most vulnerable patients, caught in the middle of a raging battle – waiting for help that never arrived.

Here is what CNN found

CNN geolocated the video to Al-Nasr hospital in northern Gaza. This area has been largely unreachable to journalists in recent weeks due to the intensity of fighting but during the seven-day truce Baalousha says he was able to access the hospital to film what was left there.

From early November, the Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi children’s hospitals, which form part of the same complex, had become the frontline of fighting between Israeli and Hamas forces.

In public statements and interviews, several medical staff and health officials from Al-Nasr said they had to hurriedly evacuate the hospital on November 10, under the direction of Israeli forces.

Medical staff described having to leave young children behind in the ICU because they had no means to safely move them.

A doctor associated with the hospital, who did not want to be named, told CNN that two of the children – a two-year-old and a nine-month-old baby – had died shortly before the evacuation but that three children were left alive still connected to respirators. One of those left alive was two months old. Several of the infants on the ICU had been suffering from genetic disorders, according to the doctor.

The condition of those left behind alive – both at the time the fighting reached the hospital and when the evacuation took place – remains unclear.

In a video on November 9, the head of Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi pediatric hospitals, Dr. Mustafa al-Kahlout, said Al-Nasr hospital had been “struck twice” sustaining “a lot of damage.”

Kahlout warned oxygen to the ICU “was cut off” and reported at least one patient had died as a result, with others facing the risk of death.

It’s unclear whether oxygen cylinders, seen next to some of the beds in the video from the hospital, were functioning or whether supplies had run out.

“The situation is really bad, we are surrounded… ambulances cannot reach the hospital, and ambulances that tried to reach Al-Nasr were targeted,” Kahlout said, calling on international organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to intervene and save the medical staff and patients who remained in the ICU.

Video shared on social media on November 9, which CNN verified, was filmed from inside Al-Nasr hospital and appears to show the aftermath of the building being hit.

Another from November 10 showed an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tank outside Al-Nasr, indicating the IDF was operating in the area. Another video from the same date showed civilians holding up makeshift white flags attempting to flee the hospital amid gunfire, then being forced to run back inside. It is not possible to tell from the video who is shooting.

Satellite imagery reviewed by CNN from November 11 shows large craters around the hospital complex, indicating the area had been under bombardment, making evacuation difficult.

But, in an audio recording of a conversation between a senior official at Al-Rantisi hospital and an officer from COGAT, which coordinates the Israeli government’s activities in the Palestinian territories and Gaza, it appears Israeli forces instructed hospital patients and staff to evacuate.

In the recording, released by the IDF on November 11, the Israeli officer assures the hospital official that ambulances will be arranged.

The hospital official tells the COGAT officer that ambulances cannot reach the hospital, and the officer replies: “I’ll arrange coordination with the primary aid center. Don’t worry, I’m near the army, it will be okay.”

“Will the ambulances take the patients and the medical staff?” the hospital official asks.

“No problem,” the COGAT officer responds, in the recording.

The hospital official then confirms that the COGAT officer is aware that people will be evacuating both Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi hospitals, and the COGAT officer says “yes, yes.”

But hospital officials say the ambulances never arrived.

“Many of the patients were carried out by their families, ambulances couldn’t reach the hospital,” Kahlout said in a news conference on November 14, following the evacuation.

Three children were left in the ICU attached to hospital machines but without oxygen, Kahlout said.

In an audio recording from November 10 released by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) a nurse who the organization said was volunteering in a personal capacity, said the hospital had been shelled, hitting multiple floors, water tanks, and electricity and oxygen stations.

The nurse – who CNN is not identifying for security reasons – said Al-Nasr staff were given 30 minutes to evacuate by the IDF, adding no ambulances were able to reach the hospital.

“We walked out a little bit there was shooting around us,” he said in the recording. Then he said someone from the IDF told him “I’ll give you safe passage, you have from 1130am until 12 noon.”

“So, we walked out with our hands up in the air carrying white flags and carrying families and children,” the nurse said in the recording.

He said he managed to carry one baby with him as he escaped and handed it to an ambulance headed for the Al-Shifa hospital. But four children were left behind in the ICU according to the nurse, in a discrepancy from the number given by Kahlout.

“To leave my patient dying in front of my eyes is the hardest thing I have ever experienced, it’s indescribable, they broke our hearts, we couldn’t help them, we couldn’t take them, we barely left ourselves with our children, we are civilians, we are a medical crew, we are displaced civilians,” he said in the recording.

Over the past week, CNN has tried to speak to medical staff and hospital officials from Al-Nasr, but all have either said they are too afraid to speak or cannot be reached.

The director of Gaza’s hospitals at the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health, Dr. Mohammad Zaqout, told CNN that people in the hospital were forced to leave by the IDF.

“We were forced to leave them behind to die because we didn’t have a safe medical evacuation… we informed them that these children were on beds and couldn’t be evacuated. We held other children in our arms while being forced to evacuate,” Zaqout said.

The IDF has strongly denied responsibility for the deaths of the children in Al-Nasr ICU. “Given that the IDF did not operate inside the Al-Nasr hospital, these allegations are not only false but also a perverse exploitation of innocent lives, used as tools to spread dangerous misinformation,” the IDF said in a statement to CNN.

Asked repeatedly by CNN why it hadn’t provided ambulances for the evacuation, as the COGAT officer had promised in the recorded conversation with the hospital official, and if they were aware of the presence of children left in the ICU, as Zaqout alleged, the IDF did not directly respond.

During an online Q&A for journalists Saturday, IDF spokesman Doron Spielman dismissed the story as merely a “rumor.”

“There were no premature babies that decomposed because of the IDF. There were probably no babies that decomposed whatsoever,” Spielman said. “But Hamas is in charge of Nasr hospital, we are not occupying Nasr hospital.”

Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals as command centers and even as places to hold hostages.

Zaqout denies the allegation and has repeatedly called for “neutral entities, human rights organizations, and media outlets to enter the hospitals and verify for themselves that they are used solely for civilian and humanitarian purposes.”

CNN cannot independently confirm what state the children were in when they were left at the hospital. But Stefan Schmitt, a forensic scientist at Florida International University reviewed the video for CNN and said the level of decomposition of the infants was advanced.

Schmitt said he believed the room had not been disturbed since the children were left. “Those remains decomposed in situ, meaning they decomposed there on those beds,” he said. “You can see that from the bodily fluids that have leaked out over the time of decomposition.”

Schmitt also said one of the corpses appeared to be wrapped in fabric, possibly a shroud, noting there was no medical equipment attached to the body, suggesting the body may already have been dead or severely injured. The room appeared to have been abandoned in a hurry, Schmitt continued, noting the infant car seat and what appears to be a bag packed for one of the children next to its bed.

A statement from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health issued in response to the video of the babies’ remains said Al-Nasr nursing staff were ordered to leave by the IDF, who told them the ICRC was coming to evacuate the patients.

“Instead, their decomposed bodies were found in their beds,” reads the statement. “These babies drew their last breaths alone and died alone.”

The ICRC told CNN it received “several requests” for evacuation from hospitals in the north of Gaza, but due to the “security situation” it was “not involved in any operations or evacuations, nor did teams commit to doing so.” The ICRC added the footage of the deceased children was an “unspeakable tragedy.”

217,US officials discuss post-war Gaza governance plans with Palestinian Authority and Arab nations,"Washington CNN —

US officials are discussing post-war Gaza governance plans with the Palestinian Authority along with regional US allies – making it a key focus as they try to look beyond the immediate conflict.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Friday afternoon with a delegation of Arab counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority, where the topic of Gaza after the Israeli offensive was expected to be a main point of discussion.

Shortly before the meeting began, the US vetoed a UN resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

A draft version of the resolution, presented by the United Arab Emirates, had called for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,” as well as “the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages” and “ensuring humanitarian access,” according to a draft copy.

The US was the lone veto. The UK abstained because the resolution did not condemn the October 7 Hamas attack.

When the war is over, US officials have said they ultimately envision both Gaza and the West Bank being ruled by a unified government led by a “revitalized” Palestinian Authority.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who initially rebuffed the idea of the PA ruling Gaza on the heels of the Israeli offensive, has shifted his position. Still, many questions remain about the immediate “day after” for Gaza once the war ends. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Wednesday that the US understands that there will be “some kind of transition period” in which Israeli forces remain in Gaza after the end of combat operations, but that cannot be permanent.

A Western diplomat told CNN that in past conversations the Arab delegation has made clear that they are not eager to be involved with an international force to provide security in Gaza after the war. The ministers have also said that if the world wants Arab states to play a role in reconstruction and support of the PA, there must be a path towards a Palestinian state.

At a press conference in Washington, DC, Friday, the delegation underscored that they were not willing to discuss the “day after” solely in the context of Gaza, but rather in the context of a Palestinian state.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi suggested on CNN they would not play a role in an international peacekeeping force, and condemned Israel’s offensive.

“All of us are losing our credibility,” he told Jim Sciutto on “CNN Newsroom” on Max.

“We are losing credibility in front of our people because our own people are looking at us and saying, ‘Okay, you’re demanding that Israel stop. It’s not. The whole international community has failed to act in any meaningful manner to stop the massacre,’” he said. “So. Everybody’s losing credibility. Moderation is losing credibility. The camp of peace is losing credibility. So that is a danger with which we we’re going to have to reckon at some point or the other.”

The delegation reiterated their call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and cast aspersions on members of the international community – like the US – for failing to advocate for one.

A senior administration official said that privately there is some consternation within the administration over the US’ Arab allies’ reluctance to play any role in a post-war international peacekeeping force, since they have been among the loudest in condemning Israel’s assault on Gaza. One Arab ambassador told CNN that their country would “absolutely not” place any of its own forces in Gaza after the war. Part of that is because the Arab states do not want to be seen as subjugating the Palestinians, the ambassador explained.

The Biden administration has consistently advocated for a two-state solution. Last month, Blinken laid out the administration’s terms for “durable peace and security” in Gaza after the war, which include no Israeli re-occupation and no reduction in territory. As such, the US is opposed to the establishment of an Israeli security buffer zone within Gaza after the war.

Vice President Kamala Harris also raised post-conflict Gaza in multiple meetings and calls with Arab leaders last weekend when in Dubai, telling reporters that she shared what expectations the US will have with regard to post-conflict planning.

“Specifically, I proposed three areas of focus,” Harris said, citing reconstruction of infrastructure in Gaza, reinforcing Palestinian Authority security and revitalizing PA governance. Harris also reiterated that a two-state solution is the best path forward.

Blinken met with Abbas in Ramallah last week. Harris’ national security adviser, Phil Gordon, held additional meetings in the West Bank this week.

“He underscored our commitment to the future establishment of a Palestinian state and made clear that the Palestinian people must have a hopeful political horizon. To that end, Dr. Gordon discussed the revitalization of the Palestinian Authority,” according to a White House readout.

It’s an extension of what US national security officials have telegraphed as it relates to Gaza and the PA.

“Leadership choices – these are, of course, up to the Palestinian people and Palestinians themselves. But there are a number of things that we think would be critical to making sure that, again, the Palestinian Authority can be effective in helping to advance the aspirations and the needs of its people,” Blinken said last week.

Deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said last month that the PA will “have to be part” of any future governing solution in both the West Bank and Gaza following the current hostilities – a prospect that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has explicitly opposed.

The senior administration official told CNN that the apparent disagreement between the US and Israel over a future role for the PA is overstated. The US agrees that the Palestinian Authority in its current, weakened state would be unlikely to be able to govern Gaza, but that a “revitalized” PA – including potentially with new leadership entirely – is a plausible solution.

Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told Bloomberg that he sees a role for Hamas in future Gaza governance – a prospect that would also be firmly rejected by Israel, whose stated goal is to eliminate the group. US officials have said there cannot be a return to the “status quo” before October 7. The Western diplomat told CNN that privately, many of the Arab partners also do not want Hamas to remain in control in Gaza.

It’s not clear that such an arrangement is even possible, given the long history of enmity between Hamas in Gaza and its bitter political rival Fatah, which controls the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The two sides have tried – and failed – multiple times to reach an agreement to unite the two separate Palestinian territories under one governance structure.

Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation agreement in Cairo in October 2017 under pressure from the Arab states, led by Egypt. Under the deal, a new unity government was supposed to take administrative control of Gaza two months later, ending a decade of rivalry that began when Hamas violently evicted the Palestinian Authority from Gaza in 2007.

But the deal’s lofty aspirations quickly collapsed. When Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah visited Gaza in March 2018, he was the target of an assassination attempt when a bomb detonated near his convoy. Hamdallah’s Fatah party immediately blamed Hamas for the attack.

218,Egypt’s president expected to secure third term as the world’s eyes are fixed on Gaza,"CNN —

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to secure his third term in power in a Sunday presidential election that critics have called a sham, as global attention is focused on the bloody war in neighboring Gaza.

The 69-year-old president has enjoyed two months of a pause in criticism from Western allies over his authoritarian rule and heightened crackdown on dissent, experts say, attributing the shift to Sisi’s renewed diplomatic relevance on the international stage due to the Israel-Hamas war.

Several top Western officials have paid Sisi visits since the war began, including United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

HA Hellyer, nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in London, said that Cairo has historically been “a critical interlocutor for the international community in general when it comes to the Arab-Israeli conflict.”

“As the Israeli-Palestinian question diminished in importance in many policy arenas, which was clearly a fundamentally flawed approach, so did Cairo’s geopolitical weight,” Hellyer told CNN, adding that with the Palestinian issue now prominently back in discussions, “there is a new prioritization internationally for good and comprehensive contact with Egypt.”

Egypt controls the Rafah crossing, the sole remaining link between the Gaza Strip – which Hamas controls – and the outside world. Egyptian officials have played mediation roles in previous wars between Israel and Hamas, as Cairo maintains diplomatic ties with both sides. During the current conflict, Egypt’s good offices have been used to deliver crucial aid into Gaza and to help secure the release of some of the hostages held there by Hamas since its militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting more than 240 others.

Egypt has also helped foreign nationals escape the carnage in Gaza, along with injured Palestinians. More than 17,000 Palestinians have so far been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which cites sources from the Hamas-controlled enclave. Aid has also been able to trickle into Gaza through Rafah.

Meanwhile, Sisi is moving to quietly secure another presidential term with little to no opposition at home or abroad, critics say.

“There are no elections. There is electoral theater,” Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington, DC, told CNN, citing the lack of viable opposition to Sisi.

The former field marshal rose to power in 2013 after overthrowing Mohamed Morsy, Egypt’s only democratically elected president, in a military coup. Sisi ran for president in 2014 and 2018, winning both elections with a sweeping majority. In 2019, his government passed constitutional amendments that permitted him to run for a third term.

“The terrible violence we’re witnessing (in Gaza) helped Sisi divide the attention of the public from their domestic concerns onto what’s happening, particularly the Palestinians in Gaza,” Kaldas said. “And as a result, somewhat reduce the level of focus on their own domestic plight, particularly their economic struggles.”

Egypt has also spent the past two months reminding its international partners of how “vitally important” it is, Kaldas said. Egypt can say: “See the useful role we play in negotiations and facilitation of the humanitarian assistance that needs to go to Gaza,” he added.

Sisi has appeared keen to capitalize on the crisis and present himself as a champion of the Palestinian cause. In a speech last month, the president repeated his call for a ceasefire, as well as his refusal of the “displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip,” calling such a prospect a red line.

While diplomats have been focused on Gaza, critics and human rights groups have lambasted Egypt over the past two months for what they say is its suppression of political dissent and silencing of opposition candidates.

Former lawmaker Ahmed el-Tantawy, who was the most prominent potential challenger to Sisi before he ended his campaign in October, said his supporters were restricted from registering their endorsements for him. He ended his campaign after failing to register the number of signatures required to run.

The Egyptian National Elections Authority (NEA) denied el-Tantawy’s claims, according to state media.

Three other candidates are running for president, with little support expected for each. These are the head of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, Farid Zahran; Wafd party nominee Abdel Sanad Yamama; and Republican Peoples’ Party candidate Hazem Omar.

Rights watchdog Amnesty International said last month that “genuine opposition candidates (were) barred from running” in Sunday’s election, adding that since October 1, Egyptian authorities “have arrested and interrogated at least 196 individuals due to their participation in unauthorized protests, as well as on allegations of engaging in terrorism-related activities and spreading ‘false news.’”

Amnesty also criticized Egypt’s prosecution of el-Tantawy, along with members of his campaign, which the rights group says are under fire “in retaliation for exercising their rights to political participation and to freedom of expression and association.”

El-Tantawy is accused of circulating election-related papers without the permission of the authorities. His trial date was pushed to January 9.

“Once more, the Egyptian authorities lay bare their utter intolerance for even the faintest whisper of dissent,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, as he urged the country to lift “sweeping restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.”

The Egyptian government’s foreign press center did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.

‘No one will come out to vote’

Just days before the election, streets in the capital, Cairo, were draped with large banners bearing Sisi’s portrait. An increased security presence is noticeable throughout the city, with officers and checkpoints dotting squares, highways and the entrances to bridges.

Among those boosting the pro-Sisi campaign is the Nation’s Future Party. “We are all with you” and “beloved of millions,” read the party’s pro-Sisi banners.

Despite the president’s high-profile election campaign, public sentiment is marked by frustration. Grievances regarding the economy are most evident.

Magdy Gerges, an Egyptian in his 50s who works as a driver, said economic hardships were painful, but that he feels a sense of security under Sisi’s rule.

“I’m one of those who suffer from the high prices, but this man (Sisi) gives me something more important than food; that I feel safe whenever my daughters go out,” Gerges told CNN. “By the end of the day, we will manage with our income, but what good is money if there is no security?” he said.

Gerges noted however that there are no other viable alternative candidates for voters to choose from, especially given the region’s precarious security situation.

“Even if we want to choose someone else, we have no alternative,” he said.

Another citizen, who asked to remain anonymous fearing reprisal from Egyptian authorities, questioned the legitimacy of Sunday’s election, saying polling stations will be empty since Sisi’s victory is clear.

“No one will come out to vote. People know the result in advance, so why this farce?” the man told CNN, saying it might have been better to “save these huge sums of money in the difficult economic conditions we are living in.”

Hellyer, of the Carnegie Endowment, said that with the current crisis in Gaza, Cairo might even see “potential for substantial economic assistance” from foreign nations, given the role it has played.

Egypt has been struggling to dig itself out of a debt hole that experts say requires structural reforms to avert economic collapse. Cairo’s allies in the Persian Gulf, who for years bailed out the most populous Arab nation, had in recent months criticized Egypt, saying the days of blank cheques are now over.

Egypt’s economic woes are far from resolved. Inflation is still high, and a foreign currency crisis remains unremedied. The country is also yet to meet the terms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $3 billion loan secured in December 2022 but which is yet to be disbursed.

Kaldas, of the Tahrir Institute, said that the Egyptian pound is expected to devalue further. The dollar now trades officially at 31 Egyptian pounds, and if the government decides to further devalue the exchange rate after the elections, that will translate to higher inflation, a deepening of economic hardship for individuals and businesses, and a rise in poverty, he said.

“There is no short-term scenario that doesn’t mean more economic pain for the average Egyptian,” Kaldas added.

219,Harvard President apologizes for her comments during her congressional testimony in an interview with the student newspaper,"CNN —

The president of Harvard University apologized in an interview with the school’s student newspaper after facing widespread condemnation for her disastrous congressional testimony this week, in which she and other university presidents failed to explicitly say calls for genocide of Jewish people constituted bullying and harassment on campus.

“I am sorry,” Harvard University president Claudine Gay said to The Harvard Crimson on Thursday. “Words matter.”

The apology came just days after Gay, the president of the University of Pennsylvania and the president of MIT testified at a House committee hearing focused on antisemitism on campus, to widespread criticism that they have not done enough to ensure the safety of Jewish students and others at their respective schools.

Harvard, UPenn and MIT have all come under fire – along with other US academic institutions – over perceived inaction against antisemitism on their campuses, especially in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel and the subsequent war.

At UPenn, for example, President Liz Magill has been under pressure to resign for weeks, as major donors and others say they have lost confidence in her ability to lose the school.

Harvard is also among 14 colleges under investigation by the Department of Education “for discrimination involving shared ancestry” since the October attacks.

During Tuesday’s House hearing, Gay, along with the UPenn and MIT presidents, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

Gay told the Harvard student paper that she regretted what she said.

“When words amplify distress and pain, I don’t know how you could feel anything but regret,” she said to The Crimson.

“I got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures,” Gay told the newspaper. “What I should have had the presence of mind to do in that moment was return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our Jewish community — threats to our Jewish students — have no place at Harvard, and will never go unchallenged.”

“Substantively, I failed to convey what is my truth,” she added.

The Harvard president told the paper she’s heard about how much pain students are in over the past few months.

“To contemplate that something I said amplified that pain — that’s really difficult,” Gay said to The Crimson. “It makes me sad.”

Flood of criticism

Gay has faced plenty of calls to resign, most notably from Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, a Harvard graduate who has been a vocal critic of how universities have addressed antisemitism on campus

“Throughout the hearing, the three behaved like hostile witnesses,” Ackman wrote in a post on X earlier this week, “exhibiting a profound disdain for the Congress with their smiles and smirks, and their outright refusal to answer basic questions with a yes or no answer.”

“They must all resign in disgrace,” Ackman said.

But the criticism from donors, politicians, alumni and business leaders has been reserved mostly for UPenn’s Magill, who appears most imminently at risk of losing her job. She faces a donor rebellion, including a threat from one donor to pull a $100 million gift. The Wharton board also said it wants Magill ousted.

Underscoring the anger at the three university presidents’ testimony, on Friday a bipartisan group of more than 70 US lawmakers sent a letter to board members of all three universities, demanding the dismissal of Gay and the presidents of UPenn and MIT.

“Given this moment of crisis, we demand that your boards immediately remove each of these presidents from their positions and that you provide an actionable plan to ensure that Jewish and Israeli students, teachers, and faculty are safe on your campuses,” the lawmakers wrote.

“The university presidents’ responses to questions aimed at addressing the growing trend of antisemitism on college and university campuses were abhorrent,” the bipartisan group added.

Magill, like Gay, clarified her remarks Wednesday, a day after the controversial testimony. Magill said in a short video that she should have been more forceful in her condemnation of hate speech, particularly calls for genocide.

“I was not focused on – but I should have been – the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It’s evil. Plain, and simple,” Magill said in a video posted on X. “I want to be clear: A call for genocide of Jewish people … would be harassment or intimidation.”

Unlike Gay, however, Magill has not apologized for her testimony.","['gay', 'newspaper', 'comments', 'presidents', 'upenn', 'university', 'congressional', 'apologizes', 'student', 'president', 'testimony', 'jewish', 'students', 'harvard', 'interview', 'magill']","CNN —The president of Harvard University apologized in an interview with the school’s student newspaper after facing widespread condemnation for her disastrous congressional testimony this week, in which she and other university presidents failed to explicitly say calls for genocide of Jewish people constituted bullying and harassment on campus.

220,Rishi Sunak is picking a fight on the migration issue that he probably cannot win,"CNN —

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has a major problem.

As his governing Conservative Party prepares to enter what will likely be an election year in 2024, it is languishing behind the opposition Labour Party in polls week after week.

The Conservatives have been in power since 2010, during which time they’ve gone through five prime ministers and virtually every possible iteration of conservatism imaginable. And after 13 years in power, it’s fair to say the party looks a little tired and out of ideas.

This is why Sunak is leaning into the Conservatives’ historical trump card issue: immigration.

Sunak, himself the son of immigrants, is currently throwing absolutely everything he has at trying to bring down the UK’s net migration numbers – which reached a record high of 745,000 in 2022.

That high number exists for various reasons: The UK has had generous policies to welcome people fleeing Ukraine and Hong Kong in recent years.

Since leaving the European Union, the UK is no longer part of the Dublin Regulation, an EU law that is designed to share the burden of hosting asylum seekers across the bloc by allowing member states to return migrants to the EU country they first entered – something the UK used effectively and benefited from.

The implications of this can be seen most clearly in the number of people now crossing the English Channel in small boats.

The boats are largely run by criminal trafficking gangs who help migrants illegally enter the UK in unsafe, crowded vessels that have on multiple occasions led to people drowning.

While these small boats are not the chief reason for the UK’s immigration numbers, they arguably have the highest profile.

In 2018 , the number of people detected crossing the English Channel in small boats was 299, according to Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. In 2022, that number was 45,755.

Of course, 45,755 is a fraction of the 745,000 net immigration total. However, for the places that are most affected by these small boat landings, that enormous increase is very visible. For the people who live in areas where these migrants end up being housed while their asylum claims are processed, it is impossible not to notice the influx into local populations.

Politically, small boat crossings have become a touchstone issue for the next election – hence Sunak making stopping the boats one of his five key priorities at the start of this year.

He has inherited a controversial plan from his predecessors whereby the UK reached an agreement with Rwanda that refugees could be sent to that country instead of staying in the UK. To date, the UK has not sent a single person to Rwanda because courts have prevented them from doing so. Most notably, the European Court of Human Rights has blocked flights to Rwanda from taking off. In short, there are human rights concerns that people who are sent to Rwanda could still face oppression in Rwanda or be sent back to their country of origin.

Sunak this week unveiled a bill that was designed to block any legal reason that planes were not flying people to Rwanda. His immigration minister resigned hours later and it is possible that his government will lose a vote on the bill in parliament next week. Meanwhile it was revealed that the British government had paid the Rwandan government an additional £100m this year as part of the deal. It had already sent £140m to the country.

For a country that in 2016 voted to leave the European Union, a foreign court interfering with domestic law is something that creates political opportunities. Enter Nigel Farage.

Farage, one of the most high-profile Brexit campaigners, has been using his media profile and daily TV show to talk about small boats for a long time.

His tactic of attacking Sunak and the Conservatives from the right has over time forced some on the right of the Conservative Party to call for increasingly tough action on immigration. Some even think there is an argument for the UK leaving the ECHR. And with an election coming up, some are even wondering if promising some kind of referendum on the UK’s membership of the ECHR in the Conservative manifesto might be a way of keeping voters who are tempted to cast their ballots for smaller right-wing parties.

Indeed, Sunak’s recently-sacked home secretary said in a statement to parliament earlier this week: “The powers to detain and remove must be exercisable notwithstanding the Human Rights Act, the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention, and all other international law … it is now or never. The Conservative Party faces electoral oblivion in a matter of months if we introduce yet another Bill destined to fail. Do we fight for sovereignty or let our party die?”

If this all sounds familiar, that’s because it’s all happened before. It was Farage’s Euroskeptic rabble-rousing that forced former Conservative leader David Cameron to put a Brexit vote in his party’s 2015 manifesto. Cameron won that election, but was forced to resign a year later after losing the referendum. Sunak can at least ask Cameron for advice, having recently made him the UK’s foreign secretary.

While Cameron has been publicly supportive of Sunak’s Rwanda plan and the bill introduced this week, it’s not hard to imagine him telling his boss that on Europe and immigration, the Conservatives simply cannot win.

The reality is that the bar set by Farage and some of his own MPs is so high that there is no way Sunak can clear it. Whatever he does, it will never be enough for the voters most-motivated by migration.

On the left – which in modern British politics can at times really mean center-right – Sunak risks looking cruel, kicking down at people who are fleeing war zones and trying to send them to a place where they are still not safe.

Sunak is desperate to flip the debate over to Labour, forcing them to take a position on immigration – but this issue is intensely toxic for Conservatives. There will always be people with the luxury of sitting outside of mainstream politics who can make noise.

And beside all of this, British attitudes to migration have evolved in the past few years – the idea of simply being strong on immigration winning votes for the Conservatives is not as true as it once was.

Some who saw it as a key issue now recognize that the health service benefited from migrant labor. Some feel post-Brexit that their concerns were addressed and that the country now has control over immigration. There are still people who care a lot about migration, of course, but the general direction of travel is that views are softening.

Given the difficult position he’s in, it’s no surprise that Sunak is looking for wedge issues ahead of the next election. But it might be that the PM has picked a fight he simply can’t win.","['rishi', 'rwanda', 'fight', 'immigration', 'party', 'sunak', 'picking', 'week', 'migration', 'small', 'conservatives', 'uk', 'boats', 'issue', 'probably', 'win', 'sent']","The implications of this can be seen most clearly in the number of people now crossing the English Channel in small boats.

221,Bear attacks in Japan are at a record high. Climate change and an aging population are making the problem worse,"Tokyo CNN —

Seishi Sato had an ominous feeling when he saw something rustling in a bush during a recent stroll in a forest in northern Japan.

Before he knew it, two Asiatic bears had sprung from the shrub, one charging at him as he frantically tried to fend it off while fearing for his life.

“When I saw them, I was so close and I thought I was in deep trouble,” the 57-year-old from Iwate prefecture, in northeast Japan, told CNN.

He survived the attack — but not without plenty of scratches and puncture wounds on his arm and thigh.

Sato is among at least 212 people who survived what has been a record year for bear attacks in Japan, according to the Ministry of Environment. Six people have died.

With a month of 2023 still to go, this year’s total has already far surpassed the 158 that took place throughout the whole of 2020 (the previous record year). And the number of bear attacks have never exceeded 200 per year since record began in 2006.

Sightings of “kuma”, or bears, are not unusual in Japan but are generally concentrated in the northern part of the country, where mountain ranges, lush bush and crystal-clear rivers provide an ideal habitat and abundant sources of the acorns, beechnuts, fruits and insects that make up their diet.

But experts say Japan’s bears are increasingly venturing out of their traditional habitats and into urban areas in search of food. Some suggest this is because climate change is interfering with the flowering and pollination of some of the animals’ traditional sources of food.

“Bears are expanding their home range this year and are coming down to areas near human settlements in search of food,” said associate professor Maki Yamamoto, who studies bears at the Nagaoka University of Technology in Niigata.

Increasingly, this is bringing them into the paths of people like Sato, who was attacked just a half-hour walk from the shop he runs, where he sells pet supplies and mushrooms he picks from the forest.

“People are becoming very alert to this situation,” said Sato, adding that other residents had been attacked outside the front doors of their village homes.

As of November, there had been 19,191 sightings across the country, up from 11,135 sightings throughout the whole of the previous year and 12,743 in 2021.

Iwate, where Sato lives, has logged more cases than anywhere else - 5,158 – followed by its neighboring prefecture of Akita, which has reported 3,000 sightings.

So pressing has the issue become that Environment Minister Shintaro Ito pledged last month to help affected communities.

“We are considering providing emergency assistance to local communities in response to their needs, such as surveying and capturing bears living in the vicinity of human settlements, taking into consideration the wishes of prefectures where human casualties due to bears are particularly on the rise,” he told a press conference.

Protective mama bears

Japan is home to two main types of bear: brown bears, which live in Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan’s main islands, and a small population of Asiatic bears, which reside in Honshu, Japan’s largest island.

Both breeds have an omnivorous diet, enjoy feeding on acorns and tend to avoid humans if possible. An Asiatic bear weighs between 40 and 100 kg while a Japanese brown bear can grow up to 400kg. But both are far from being the biggest bear on earth. Kodiak Brown Bears in Alaska, for example, can weigh up to 600kg.

“Both brown bears and Asiatic black bears are basically timid animals that avoid people,” said Professor Koji Yamazaki from the Tokyo University of Agriculture.

When bears do attack, the cause is usually because a mother bear fears an encounter with a human poses a threat to her cub, experts said.

Sato, who runs the YouTube channel Primitive Forest Bear to share his adventures in nature, recalled that the Asiatic bears he ran into appeared to be mother and child.

He captured the attack on camera and posted the video online as a reminder to others to take care.

The video, which has since gone viral, shows him screaming for his life and hitting the animal with a tree branch to drive it away. At one point, he climbs a tree to avoid being mauled. Luckily, the bear eventually turns away.

“When I saw the video, I was scared to death,” Sato said.

Climate change and population shifts

With encounters on the increase, some experts believe climate change may be a factor in pushing bears further from their traditional habitats.

“The thing is that you can have years of bad harvests and years of good harvest of acorns. And when the harvest is bad, the bears cannot store enough energy before hibernation by eating mountain acorns alone, so they get closer to human settlements looking for fruits, chestnuts, persimmons, walnuts, and farm products in general,” Yamamoto, from Nagaoka University of Technology, explained.

“This year, bears have been appearing more in the villages precisely because of the very bad harvest of acorns from the beech, the bears’ favorite tree,” she said.

Tsutomu Mano, a senior research fellow at the Hokkaido Research Organization, said climate change “is likely to have a significant impact on the flowering time of plants and the activity of insects responsible for pollination, which is necessary for fruiting.”

And when the bears don’t have enough food, they often turn to human neighborhoods to look for leftovers in the bins, he said.

Once they’ve developed a taste for human leftovers they will keep returning for more, Mano said.

Another factor that some believe may be coming into play is Japan’s rapidly shifting demographics.

With a median age of 48, Japan has one of the world’s oldest populations, according to the Economic and Social for Asia and the Pacific, a United Nations’ arm that tracks population trends.

At the same time, the country is experiencing a shift in which younger generations are increasingly moving to big cities for better job opportunities.

Taken together, the two factors mean populations on the rural edges of northern prefectures are fast dwindling, creating conditions such as “abandonment of cultivated land and overgrowth along riversides” that “make it easier for bears to enter,” according to Mano.

According to national broadcaster NHK, out of the 71 people attacked by bears in October, 61 were above the age of 60. Twenty-one people were in their 80s.

On October 24 alone, four people – all in the 70s – were injured in Akita on the same day, the broadcaster reported.

What’s the solution?

At Karuizawa, a resort town located in Nagano prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, conservationists have taken to patrolling the forest with dogs to scare the bears away, according to local media.

But officials in Akita prefecture, which recorded the second-highest number of bear attacks, have a more drastic measure in store. They have begun offering rewards to trappers.

Governor Norihisa Satake announced late last month a 5,000-yen ($33) prize for each bear captured in the prefecture. The authorities are also mulling a proposal to set aside a fund of up to 15 million yen ($100,000) to pay for the transportation of the captured bears.

But experts say a more holistic approach is needed.

“Trapping is not sufficient to manage bears, so it is necessary to consider a combination of various methods,” said Yamazaki, from the Tokyo University of Agriculture.

The first step was to study what types of bear – in terms of their ages, genders and locations - were going astray and why, he said.","['record', 'sato', 'brown', 'making', 'climate', 'japan', 'population', 'problem', 'high', 'bear', 'bears', 'asiatic', 'university', 'change', 'prefecture', 'human', 'worse', 'acorns']","Before he knew it, two Asiatic bears had sprung from the shrub, one charging at him as he frantically tried to fend it off while fearing for his life.

222,Six French teenagers convicted in connection with 2020 beheading of teacher Paty,"CNN —

A French court on Friday convicted six teenagers in connection with the 2020 beheading of history teacher Samuel Paty, whose murder shocked the country.

The teacher had shown his pupils caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression, angering some Muslim parents. Most Muslims avoid depictions of prophets, considering them to be blasphemous.

Among those on trial was a teenage girl who had allegedly told her parents that Paty had asked Muslim pupils to leave the room before showing the caricatures.

The court found her guilty of having made false accusation charges and slanderous comments, as it was established that she was not in the class at the time.

The other adolescents were found guilty of charges related to taking part in a pre-meditated criminal conspiracy and helping to prepare an ambush.

Paty, 47, was killed outside his school in a Paris suburb by an 18-year-old assailant of Chechen origin, who was shot dead by police soon after the attack.

The court found those adolescents guilty of having pointed out Paty to the murderer.

Louis Cailliez, lawyer for Paty’s sister Mickaelle, told reporters his client was “satisfied with the full conviction,” but less so with the sentences, that she found “too lenient”.

Dylan Slama, a lawyer for one of the teenagers, said that though it was hard to talk about satisfaction in such tragic circumstances, there was a sense of relief for his client.

The heaviest sentence was given to an adolescent who was formally given a 6-month prison sentence, although he should be able to serve this at home while under electronic surveillance.

The girl who was found guilty of making false accusations and slanderous comments was given an 18-month suspended sentence and put on probation measures for two years.

All six teenagers’ suspended sentences are tied to them following a strict set of probation measures for two to three years.

223,Appeals court maintains most of Trump gag order in federal election subversion case,"CNN —

An appeals court has largely upheld the gag order against former President Donald Trump in the federal election subversion case, saying he can be barred from talking about witnesses as well as prosecutors, the court staff and their family members.

But the court said the gag order does not apply to comments made about special counsel Jack Smith and narrows the prohibition Trump had for speaking about witnesses in the case, a change from the original gag order.

The decision against Trump is a striking admonishment for an ex-president facing an upcoming criminal trial, but also makes clear Trump is still allowed to criticize President Joe Biden and the Justice Department and to argue the prosecution “is politically motivated or that he is innocent of the charges against him.”

The three appeals court judges who issued Friday’s ruling — Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard and Bradley Garcia, all Democratic appointees — found Trump’s words on the public stage could undermine the fairness of a jury trial, sway or intimidate witnesses and imperil court staff. The court said that justifies limiting Trump’s speech, even while he campaigns to return to the presidency.

It is the second time in recent weeks that an appeals court has reinstated limits on what Trump can say publicly. Trump’s also under a gag order in New York barring him from attacking court staff in a civil fraud trial against him and his business there. Trump is set to testify in that case on Monday.

Trump vowed to appeal the decision in a social media post on Friday.

Friday’s lengthy opinion came from all three judges who heard Trump’s appeal at the DC Circuit Court nearly two weeks ago, and was written by Millett.

“Mr. Trump’s documented pattern of speech and its demonstrated real-time, real-world consequences pose a significant and imminent threat to the functioning of the criminal trial process in this case,” the appeals court wrote.

The court said that Trump’s campaign for the 2024 presidency “does not alter the court’s historical commitment or obligation to ensure the fair administration of justice in criminal cases.”

“We do not allow such an order lightly. Mr. Trump is a former President and current candidate for the presidency, and there is a strong public interest in what he has to say,” the court said.

“But Mr. Trump is also an indicted criminal defendant, and he must stand trial in a courtroom under the same procedures that govern all other criminal defendants. That is what the rule of law means.”

Court cites Trump’s attacks on Meadows and Pence

In explaining their decision, the appeals court pointed to the former president’s many public statements and attacks against witnesses in the case, including former chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Vice President Mike Pence.

The court said that such statements “pose a significant” risk that witnesses would be intimidated and “unduly influenced” in the case. Some witnesses have “had their lives turned upside down after coming within Mr. Trump’s verbal sights,” the court wrote.

The court also noted that Trump is subject to release conditions barring him from direct communication with witnesses.

That prohibition “would mean little if he can evade it by making the same statements to a crowd, knowing or expecting that a witness will get the message,” the court wrote.

The risk to witnesses “is largely irreversible in the age of the Internet,” the court noted. “Once an individual is publicly targeted, even revoking the offending statement may not abate the subsequent threats, harassment, or other intimidating effects during the pretrial as well as trial stages of this case.”

The court also noted Trump’s public statement shortly after being charged in the case, “If go after me, I’m coming after you,” as a broadly threatening message toward people working on the case, and said his “messaging [was] daggered at likely witnesses and their testimony.”

Trump is still able to publicly share opinions about witnesses who include several high-profile critics of his who served in his presidential administration.

Trial delay would ‘simply compound the problem’

In the ruling Friday, the appeals court pushed back forcefully against Trump’s argument that his criminal trial should be delayed until after the 2024 presidential election as an alternative to limiting his speech, writing that it would be “counterproductive, create perverse incentives, and unreasonably burden the judicial process.”

Trump has repeatedly argued in court that his criminal trial in the election interference case, which is scheduled for March, should be delayed until after the November presidential election. So far, all of his efforts have been rejected.

“Allowing prejudicial statements to go unchecked for an even longer pre-trial period would simply compound the problem,” the appeals court wrote.

The court also said that allowing the former president’s threatening speech to “override the district court’s control and management of the trial schedule” would incentivize other criminal defendants to also say or post harmful things as a means of delaying their own prosecutions.

The gag order doesn’t prohibit Trump from making any comments but rather statements “made with the intent to materially interfere” with the case. For instance, Trump can publicly speak about witnesses, the appeals court said, but not about their “potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding.”

The appeals court said his words about possible witnesses would have to be looked at in context.

“That allows the former President to continue to speak out about those same persons’ books, articles, editorials, interviews, or political campaigns as long as he does so in a manner that does not concern their roles as witnesses or the content of any expected testimony,” the court wrote.

In addition, the court strongly backed his ability to disparage the special counsel.

“As a high-ranking government official who exercises ultimate control over the conduct of this prosecution, the Special Counsel is no more entitled to protection from lawful public criticism than is the institution he represents,” the court wrote.

224,"Ryan O’Neal, star of ‘Love Story’ and ‘Peyton Place,’ dead","CNN —

Oscar-nominated actor Ryan O’Neal, star of several landmark films including “Love Story” and “Paper Moon,” has died, according to his son, Patrick, who posted the news to social media. He was reportedly 82.

“My dad passed away peacefully today, with his loving team by his side supporting him and loving him as he would us,” Patrick O’Neal wrote on Friday.

He added: “My father Ryan O’Neal has always been my hero. I looked up to him and he was always bigger than life.”

CNN has reached out to a representative for Ryan O’Neal.

Ryan O’Neal’s breakout role came in 1964 on the nighttime soap opera “Peyton Place.”

A Hollywood “Love Story”

After starring in several TV shows throughout the 1960s, O’Neal made an indelible mark on the movies in the 1970 adaptation of the Erich Segal novel “Love Story,” in which he starred opposite Ali MacGraw. The tearjerker film told the story of a wealthy Ivy Leaguer (Ryan O’Neal) who marries an outspoken and irreverent girl (MacGraw), only to watch her die of a terminal illness. Among other things, it popularized the line, “Love means never having to say you’re sorry.”

The film was a huge hit, providing a major boost to Paramount Pictures (which was being run by MacGraw’s then-husband, Robert Evans), and while it established Ryan O’Neal as a classic leading man – and earned him an Oscar nomination in the process – he also found success in comedy, playing opposite Barbra Streisand in “What’s Up, Doc?” and “The Main Event.”

On X (formerly Twitter), Streisand said she was “sad” to hear the news of the actor’s death.

“He was funny and charming, and he will be remembered,” she wrote.

Ryan O’Neal later starred in a “Love Story” sequel called “Oliver’s Story,” which flopped at the box office.

The actor’s eclectic resume included starring with his daughter, Tatum O’Neal, in “Paper Moon,” for which she won an Academy Award for best supporting actress; and the Stanley Kubrick-directed period piece “Barry Lyndon.”

Off screen, O’Neal had a long relationship with actress and pin-up model Farrah Fawcett, which provided endless fodder for the tabloids. The relationship followed earlier marriages to actresses Joanna Moore and Leigh Taylor-Young.

Born in Los Angeles, O’Neal trained to become a professional boxer before he began to pursue acting, appearing in several TV westerns, and eventually landing his regular role on “Peyton Place.”

O’Neal’s more recent credits included recurring roles on the TV shows “Bones” and “Bull,” along with appearances on “Desperate Housewives” and the reboot “90210.”

Strained relationship

Ryan O’Neal and his daughter Tatum O’Neal’s off-screen relationship was strained for many years.

She had struggled with addiction, and in 2011, the father and daughter starred in the reality series “Ryan and Tatum: The O’Neals” on OWN.

A clip of that show was featured that year during a Tatum O’Neal appearance on CNN.

“How would I feel if my father were to, say, get sick or die even? Would I be OK? And I realized that I wouldn’t be OK,” she said in the clip. “So I knew I needed to make an effort, because what is your life without your family? What’s your life without a father?”

In 2020, Tatum O’Neal’s son shared on social media that the family had reconciled.

The actor had four children. In addition to Tatum O’Neal, he had a son, Griffin O’Neal, with Moore. He also had a son, Redmond James O’Neal, with Fawcett. Patrick O’Neal, a sportscaster, was from his marriage with Taylor-Young.

His brother, actor Kevin O’Neal, died earlier this year.

226,European Union agrees to regulate AI development,"CNN —

European Union lawmakers struck a deal Friday agreeing to one of the world’s first major comprehensive artificial intelligence laws.

The landmark legislation, called the AI Act, sets up a regulatory framework to promote the development of AI while addressing the risks associated with the rapidly evolving technology. The legislation bans harmful AI practices “considered to be a clear threat to people’s safety, livelihoods and rights.”

The law comes amid growing fears about the disruptive capabilities of artificial intelligence.

In a news conference, Roberta Metsola, the president of the European Parliament, called the law “a balanced and human-centered approach” that will “no doubt be setting the global standard for years to come.”

The regulatory framework, which classifies AI uses by risk and increases regulation on higher risk levels, was first proposed in 2021.

The riskiest uses for AI are banned. According to the law, those include systems that exploit specific vulnerable groups, biometric identification systems for law enforcement purposes and artificial intelligence that deploys manipulative “subliminal techniques.”

Limited risk systems, such as chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, or technology that generates images, audio or video content, are subject to new transparency obligations under the law.

“The #AIAct is much more than a rulebook – it’s a launchpad for EU startups and researchers to lead the global AI race,” Thierry Breton, the EU Commissioner for Internal Market, wrote on social media. “The best is yet to come.”

Artificial intelligence broke into the mainstream with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. Seemingly overnight, generative AI technology exploded in popularity and spurred an AI arms race.

But AI’s disruption reaches far beyond the world of big tech: Educators have struggled with generative AI’s ability to complete schoolwork assignments; artists and musicians have grappled with the potential for AI-fueled imitation; and even the media industry has seen its controversies.

Some of the companies behind the technology have experienced growing pains, as well.

OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, was briefly ousted and then reinstated over the course of a few drama-filled days in November – with the exact reasons for the leadership changes still unclear, weeks later.

227,Tomato lost in space by history-making astronaut has been found,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Perhaps nowhere in the universe is a fresh, ripe tomato more valuable than on the International Space Station, where astronauts live for months at a time subsisting mainly on prepackaged, shelf-stable goods.

That’s why astronaut Frank Rubio became the central figure in a lighthearted whodunnit that has taken months to solve.

After Rubio harvested one of the first tomatoes ever grown in space earlier this year, according to the astronaut, he admitted he misplaced it.

“I put it in a little bag, and one of my crewmates was doing a (public) event with some schoolkids, and I thought it’d be kind of cool to show the kids — ‘Hey guys this is the first tomato harvested in space,’” Rubio said during an October media event. “I was pretty confident that I Velcroed it where I was supposed to Velcro it … and then I came back and it was gone.”

In the microgravity environment of space, anything not anchored to a wall is at risk of floating away — destined to spend eternity hidden behind a nook or cranny within the football field-size orbiting laboratory and its labyrinthian passageways.

Rubio said he probably spent eight to 20 hours of his own free time just searching for that tomato.

“Unfortunately — because that’s just human nature — a lot of people are like, ‘He probably ate the tomato,’” Rubio said. “And I wanted to find it mostly so I could prove like I did not eat the tomato.”

But he never found it.

Rubio returned to Earth on September 27 with the precious produce still lost aboard the space station.

It remained lost — until now.

During a Wednesday news conference, members of the seven-person crew remaining on the space station revealed they had finally located the tomato.

Rubio had “been blamed for quite a while for eating the tomato,” NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli said. “But we can exonerate him.”

Tomato on top of a historic mission

The astronauts did not reveal where the tomato was or specify what state the produce was in when found.

Rubio surmised in October that it had probably already shriveled into an unrecognizable rot.

Due to the humidity at the space station, “it probably desiccated to the point where you couldn’t tell what it was,” Rubio said.

Case closed.

Rubio’s return to Earth in September was a historic moment. His stay on the space station — which lasted more than a year — set a record for the longest a US astronaut has ever spent in microgravity.

Rubio originally expected to spend only six months aboard the International Space Station. Instead, he logged 371 days following the discovery of a coolant leak coming from his original ride — a Russian Soyuz spacecraft — while it was docked to the orbiting outpost.

In his October interview, Rubio acknowledged how arduous moments of the journey were.

“I kind of allowed myself a day to feel sad and sorry for myself, and then I try to really make a conscious decision to say OK let’s have a good attitude and let’s just try to do the best job possible,” Rubio said of learning his stay would be extended by another six months.

228,"Three dead in outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, CDC warns","CNN —

An outbreak of the tickborne disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever has caused at least five illnesses, including three deaths, in the US since July, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Friday.

The five cases were identified in Southern California and involved people who had traveled to Tecate, Baja California, in the previous two weeks. Four were under age 18, and three were US residents, the agency said in a health alert. All five were hospitalized, and three died.

The CDC is warning health care providers that if a patient has symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and has recently traveled to northern Mexico, they should consider starting treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline right away, rather than waiting for test results to confirm the condition.

“RMSF is a severe, rapidly progressive, and often deadly disease transmitted by the bite of infected ticks, although many patients do not recall being bitten by a tick,” the agency notes. It’s endemic in northern Mexico and in parts of the southwestern US, where it can be transmitted by brown dog ticks. It does not spread from person to person.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Signs of infection can be mild in the first few days, including a low fever, headache, stomach problems, abdominal pain, rash and swelling around the eyes and on the back of the hands. On or after about five days, someone may develop changes in mental state, coma, brain swelling, respiratory problems and multiorgan damage. It’s fatal in 5% to 10% of cases, with about half of those deaths happening within eight days of the onset of illness.

Anyone who’s traveled to northern Mexico and develops symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever within two weeks of their return to the US should get medical attention right away, the CDC says. Protect against tick bites by treating pet dogs, using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing when outdoors. Check yourself and children for ticks after spending time outdoors or around dogs, and immediately remove any ticks you find.","['mountain', 'outbreak', 'rocky', 'cdc', 'northern', 'traveled', 'fever', 'ticks', 'mexico', 'dead', 'health', 'spotted', 'warns', 'disease']","CNN —An outbreak of the tickborne disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever has caused at least five illnesses, including three deaths, in the US since July, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Friday.

229,Billionaire Ken Langone is latest GOP megadonor to endorse Nikki Haley,"CNN —

Billionaire Ken Langone on Friday endorsed Nikki Haley’s presidential bid in the latest sign of the Republican moneyed class rallying behind her as the main alternative to Donald Trump in the GOP primary.

“I think she is just what we need right now. I think her approach is smart. I think she’s qualified,” Langone said on Fox News. “More importantly, I think the American people need this kind of leadership – statesmanlike, elegant. Just think of … where we have been in the last six or seven or eight years. It is not good at all.”

Langone, a co-founder of Home Depot, is the latest in a growing list of wealthy donors to back the former South Carolina governor. The network associated with billionaire Charles Koch announced its support for her last week, as did North Carolina retail magnate Art Pope. Earlier this week, LinkedIn co-founder and billionaire Democratic donor Reid Hoffman gave $250,000 to support her campaign.

Langone said that while he likes GOP contender Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor’s “numbers aren’t moving.”

“The writing is on the wall,” Langone told Fox News. “On the other hand, Nikki Haley has had a substantial upswing. The one thing I’m committed to is we have to beat Joe Biden. If Joe Biden is going to be the nominee, we have to beat him. We can’t take any more of this mayhem.”

Asked why he didn’t endorse Trump, Langone said the former president’s time has “come and gone” and condemned his actions toward the end of his White House tenure.

“What Trump put this country through the last three months of his presidency was disgraceful,” Langone said.

“I think what happened on January 6 – all he had to say is ‘Please go home.’ … But he sat in a room and watched it for three hours and did nothing about it and America deserves better than that,” he added.","['joe', 'endorse', 'megadonor', 'think', 'gop', 'support', 'trump', 'week', 'nikki', 'haley', 'langone', 'latest', 'need', 'billionaire', 'ken']","CNN —Billionaire Ken Langone on Friday endorsed Nikki Haley’s presidential bid in the latest sign of the Republican moneyed class rallying behind her as the main alternative to Donald Trump in the GOP primary.

230,Beyoncé and Taylor Swift have never had the rivalry many try to suggest,"CNN —

Beyoncé vs Taylor Swift is less about them than it is about a larger discussion about erasure and ethnicity.

Both women have been successful performers for decades, endorsing each other’s artistry along the way. But many of their supporters and cultural critics continue to compare their careers, along with how their work is received and acknowledged.

The latest example was the reception this week to Swift being named Time’s 2023 Person of the Year. New York Times bestselling author and cultural critic Luvvie Ajayi Jones noted Beyoncé’s omission from the list of individuals considered.

“Taylor being TIME person of the year while Beyoncé was not even nominated when they had VERY comparable years in terms quantifiable impact is actually wild,” Ajayi Jones wrote on Instagram.

“They both had record-breaking sold out world tours and BOTH shifted economies ad BOTH had documentaries come out,” she continued. “ONE of them was crowned the PERSON OF THE YEAR. While the other was not even considered for the title.”

Swift’s “Eras Tour” reportedly grossed more than an estimated $1 billion, while Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” tour reportedly grossed an estimated $570 million. However, she had 56 tour dates compared to Swift’s 146.

“Whether or not you are BeyHive [the term for her hardcore fans] or can’t stand her, you cannot deny the obvious erasure,” Ajayi Jones added. “Because there is only ONE main thing that makes her and Taylor different. You can be one of the most influential women in the world, and because you’re Black you can still be locked out.”

Other well known people, including journalist Cari Champion, responded with support in Ajayi Jones’ comments on the post.

“When tell you that YOU always have the time and you are ON TIME,” Champion remarked.

TV personality and author Nicole Waters commented, “She’s won everything and still can’t win. We thank God she doesn’t measure her worth by accolades issued by ‘not us.’ And that’s the lesson.”

For some, the selection of Swift is a continuation of the debate about industry disparities between Black and white artists and how their work is valued.

In 2017, there were accusations of racism after Adele topped Beyoncé in the album of the year category at the Grammy awards.

Yet the argument can be made that far from allowing issues of race to hold her back, Beyoncé has used it to fuel her art (see “Lemonade,” “Black Is King” and “Renaissance” for confirmation of that). It also bears mention that while she has not yet won an album of the year Grammy, Beyoncé holds the all-time record for most Grammy wins by a single artist with 32.

So while comparisons between the two artists may continue, the women themselves have only shown each other love.

Taylor Swift pushes back on comparing tours

In her interview with Time, Swift called out those who would position her in competition with Beyoncé.

“There were so many stadium tours this summer, but the only ones that were compared were me and Beyoncé,” Swift said. “Clearly it’s very lucrative for the media and stan culture to pit two women against each other, even when those two artists in question refuse to participate in that discussion.”

She also hailed Bey, saying “She’s the most precious gem of a person — warm and open and funny.”

“And she’s such a great disrupter of music-industry norms,” Swift said. “She taught every artist how to flip the table and challenge archaic business practices.”

Concert films

Both artists recently released films documenting their tours and attended the film premieres for the other.

In October, Swift gushed about Beyoncé showing up for the premiere for her “Eras Tour” concert film in Los Angeles.

“I’m so glad I’ll never know what my life would’ve been like without @beyonce’s influence. The way she’s taught me and every artist out here to break rules and defy industry norms,” Swift wrote in the caption of a video posted on social media showing the two of them inside of the theater. “Her generosity of spirit. Her resilience and versatility. She’s been a guiding light throughout my career and the fact that she showed up tonight was like an actual fairytale.”

Swift returned the gesture the following month, when Beyoncé’s film premiered in London.

Beyoncé literally gives Swift her flowers

In 2021, both women had a big night at the Grammys.

Swift won album of the year for “Folklore” and Beyoncé notched her 28th Grammy, becoming the most Grammy-winning female artist of all time.

The latter sent the former a beautiful bouquet of flowers with a note that read, “Congratulations on your Grammy. It was great seeing you on Sunday night. Thank you for always being so supportive. Sending love to you and your family. B.”

Swift shared a photo of the flowers and note on social media writing, “Woke up to flowers from the queen of grace & greatness @beyonce and suddenly it’s the best Friday EVER. Thank you B and congratulations on your epic achievement Sunday night!!”

Beyoncé shares the stage with Swift

Kanye West leaping on stage to hijack Swift’s win for best female video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards has gone down in pop culture history.

West grabbed the microphone and said, “Yo Taylor, I’m really happy for you. Imma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!”

The camera panned to Bey in the audience, looking flabbergasted.

Later, when Bey’s “Single Ladies” won for video of the year she brought Swift out to have the moment she had earlier been denied.

“I remember being 17 years old up for my first MTV Award with Destiny’s Child and it was one of the most exciting moments in my life,” Beyoncé said. “So I’d lke for Taylor to come out and have her moment.”

Afterwards Swift had nothing but praise for what she had done.

“They told me to stand by the side of the stage and I didn’t really know what was going to go down, but I thought it was so wonderful and gracious of her to do what she’s always done,” Rolling Stone reported Swift as saying at the time. “She’s always been a great person before anything else. Before the talented artist, the superstar, she’s always been a great person and I just, I thought I couldn’t love Beyoncé more tonight, then tonight happened and it was just wonderful.”

That love clearly couldn’t be more mutual.","['suggest', 'shes', 'artist', 'try', 'tour', 'women', 'taylor', 'beyoncé', 'grammy', 'won', 'person', 'swift', 'rivalry']","CNN —Beyoncé vs Taylor Swift is less about them than it is about a larger discussion about erasure and ethnicity.

231,Prevent injuries by avoiding these common exercise errors,"Editor’s note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.

CNN —

It’s a frustrating irony that exercise — so critical to good health and longevity — also has the potential to cause harm.

Some 3.6 million people were treated in emergency departments in 2022 for various injuries involving sports and recreational equipment, according to the National Safety Council. Topping the list? Injuries from exercise and exercise equipment, which accounted for 445,642 of those emergency department visits.

Whether you’re just starting out or rebooting a fitness routine, many injuries can be prevented with a little awareness and caution, according to experts.

“One of the biggest mistakes I see is doing too much, too soon,” said Dr. Alex McDonald, a family and sports medicine physician and assistant professor of clinical science at the Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine in Pasadena, California.

McDonald said such overexercising often occurs when someone decides to begin a new exercise regimen. “But they overestimate what they can do, then get injured or quit,” he said.

Exercising should be thought of as a long game, said Lisa Herrington, a certified personal trainer in Davis, California, and cofounder of Fit House Davis. “It should not be an all-or-nothing mentality,” she said. “A little every day goes a long way.”

Be mindful of form

Using proper form when exercising is also critical, whether you’re using a piece of gym equipment or engaging in activities such as running or cycling.

“Having good form always trumps speed, weight or strength,” McDonald said. “If you have bad form, you’re not getting the full benefit of the workout, and are potentially straining other muscles and ligaments that you’re not supposed to be using.”

One common example of bad form is hanging on, or leaning over, the handrails on treadmills and elliptical machines.

“People often hang on the handrails when they’re getting tired, instead of slowing down,” Herrington said. “But handrails are supposed to help with your workout, not be a rest aid. If you’re hanging on the equipment or leaning over the bars, back off the pace or incline.”

Herrington also frequently sees people leaning too hard on bike handlebars during the spin classes she teaches, which can result in sore necks and shoulders.

“People get tired during the sprints, so all of their body weight goes into the handlebars,” she said. “They should really take a seat for a few seconds and then sprint again.”

To ensure you’re using proper form, both McDonald and Herrington said it’s best to enlist the help of a professional, such as a personal trainer or physical therapist. They are the experts, plus it’s hard to evaluate yourself.

What’s more, you carry your body differently as you age. So even if your form was great several years ago, you may need some tweaks for the body you have today.

Cycling: Proper bike setup

Cycling may seem like a straightforward exercise, but it can cause injuries, too. A frequent misstep when cycling is having an incorrect seat height.

If your bike seat is too low or high, you may develop knee or lower-back pain, as your knee angle will be altered with each pedal stroke.

Your bike seat, or saddle, should be even with your hip bone when standing next to it.

When sitting on the bike and taking your feet off the pedals, your toes should be the only thing touching the floor.

Running: Don’t overdo it

Runners are at risk of goofs such as overstriding, poor gait and overtraining.

Overstriding, a common running error, occurs when you land with your foot too far in front of your hips or knees. Doing so puts you at risk for stress- and joint-related issues. Increasing your cadence, or the frequency of your steps, lowers the high impact of running, which may reduce injuries, according to a 2021 study. Greater step frequency also combats overstriding, as you have to take shorter steps.

To see if you may have gait issues, check the bottoms of your running shoes, McDonald said. If your heels or the outsides of your shoes are quite worn, it could indicate you’re landing too forcefully and frequently in less-optimal spots.

“A lot of running stores can video you running and do a gait analysis,” he said. “Physical therapists provide this service as well. Small tweaks in your gait can make a big difference when you’re talking about preventing a repetitive injury.”

Vary your movement

Overtraining involves performing the same motions over and over again, which can fatigue the body and make it susceptible to injury. Overtraining can also cause your fitness to plateau. So no matter your favorite activity, you should routinely mix things up.

“Try new machines at the gym,” Herrington said. “Take a group exercise class. Incorporate strength training exercises into cardiovascular routines.”

Developing a strong core is essential, too. “Core exercises strengthen the front and back of your body, improve your posture and help you move better,” she said.

Build your routine gradually

No matter what workout regimen you settle on, the key to staying healthy is to start slow and low. Increase the time or intensity of your workouts by just 10% per week, McDonald said, and never boost both the intensity and duration simultaneously.

Then, enjoy.

“The goal of regular exercise is to be able to move with comfort and ease for as long as we possibly can,” Herrington said. “Doing the right exercises for your body and mind, mixing up your routine every now and then, enlisting a professional when you need guidance, and choosing exercises that bring you joy are all important pieces to living a healthy life.”

Dinosaur guts and hard evidence of their diets are rarely preserved in the fossil record, and it is the first time the stomach contents of a tyrannosaur have been uncovered.

The revelation makes this discovery particularly exciting, said co-lead author Darla Zelenitsky, a paleontologist and associate professor at the University of Calgary in Alberta.

“Tyrannosaurs are these large predatory species that roamed Alberta, and North America, during the late Cretaceous. These were the iconic apex or top predators that we’ve all seen in movies, books and museums. They walked on two legs (and) had very short arms,” Zelenitsky said.

“It was a cousin of T. rex, which came later in time, 68 to 66 million years ago. T. rex is the biggest of the tyrannosaurs, Gorgosaurus was a little bit smaller, maybe full grown would have been 9, 10 meters (33 feet).”

The tyrannosaur in question, a young Gorgosaurus libratus, would have weighed about 772 pounds (350 kilograms) — less than a horse — and reached 13 feet (4 meters) in length at the time of death.

The creature was between the ages of 5 and 7 and appeared to be picky in what it consumed, Zelenitsky said.

“Its last and second-to-last meal were these little birdlike dinosaurs, Citipes, and the tyrannosaur actually only ate the hind limbs of each of these prey items. There’s really no other skeletal remains of these predators within the stomach cavity. It’s just the hind legs.

“It must have killed … both of these Citipes at different times and then ripped off the hind legs and ate those and left the rest of the carcasses,” she added. “Obviously this teenager had an appetite for drumsticks.”

The two baby dinosaurs both belonged to the species called Citipes elegans and would have been younger than 1 year old when the tyrannosaur hunted them down, the researchers determined.

The almost complete skeleton was found in Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park in 2009.

That the tyrannosaur’s stomach contents were preserved wasn’t immediately obvious, but staff at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta, noticed small protruding bones when preparing the fossil in the lab and removed a rock within its rib cage to take a closer look.

“Lo and behold, the complete hind legs of two baby dinosaurs, both under a year old, were present in its stomach,” said co-lead author François Therrien, the museum’s curator of dinosaur paleoecology, in a statement.

The paleontologists were able to determine the ages of both the predator and its prey by analyzing thin slices sampled from the fossilized bones.

“There’s growth marks like the rings of a tree. And we can essentially tell how old a dinosaur is from looking at those, the structure of the bone,” Zelenitsky said.

Changing appetites of top predators

The fossil is the first hard evidence of a long-suspected dietary pattern among large predatory dinosaurs, said paleoecologist Kat Schroeder, a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University’s department of Earth and planetary science, who wasn’t involved in the research.

The teen tyrannosaur didn’t eat what its parents did. Paleontologists believe its diet would have changed over its life span.

“Large, robust tyrannosaurs like T. rex have bite forces strong enough to hit bone when eating, and so we know they bit into megaherbivores like Triceratops,” Schroeder said via email. “Juvenile tyrannosaurs can’t bite as deep, and therefore don’t leave such feeding traces.”

She said that scientists have previously hypothesized that young tyrannosaurs had different diets from fully developed adults, but the fossil find marks the first time researchers have direct evidence.

“Combined with the relative rarity of juvenile tyrannosaur skeletons, this fossil is very significant,” Schroeder added. “Teeth can only tell us so much about the diet of extinct animals, so finding stomach contents is like picking up the proverbial ‘smoking gun.’”

The contents of the tyrannosaur’s stomach cavity revealed that at this stage in life, juveniles were hunting swift, small prey. It was likely because the predator’s body wasn’t yet well-suited for bigger prey, Zelenitsky said.

“It’s well known that tyrannosaurs changed a lot during growth, from slender forms to these robust, bone-crushing dinosaurs, and we know that this change was related to feeding behavior.”

When the dinosaur died, its mass was only 10% of that of an adult Gorgosaurus, she said.

How juvenile tyrannosaurs filled a niche

The voracious appetite of teenage tyrannosaurs and other carnivores has been thought to explain a puzzling feature of dinosaur diversity.

There are relatively few small and midsize dinosaurs in the fossil record, particularly in the Mid- to Late Cretaceous Period — something paleontologists have determined is due to the hunting activities of young tyrannosaurs.

“In Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park, where this specimen is from, we have a very well sampled formation. And so we have a pretty good idea of the ecosystem there. Over 50 species of dinosaurs,” Zelenitsky said.

“We are missing mid-sized … predators from that ecosystem.

234,Tesla failed at battery swapping but Stellantis says it may have the secret,"CNN —

It can take 20 minutes to “fast charge” an electric car up to 80%. But what if you could just change the batteries like they were AAs in a toy, and be back on the road fully charged in a handful of minutes?

It seems like an obvious solution, but there have been some famous failures with battery swapping. A decade ago, Tesla announced it would build out a network of battery swapping stations that could change out Model S’s battery pack in 90 seconds. But like many of CEO Elon Musk’s publicly-announced ideas, it was later dropped with Musk claiming customers weren’t interested.

And in 2013, an Israeli company that promised battery swapping called Better Place went out of business after burning through $850 million in cash and deploying only about 1,000 cars, according to reports at the time.

But the idea has become a reality, again, at least in Asia. Chinese EV maker Nio has been offering battery swapping for its vehicles since 2019. Nio now claims to be the world’s largest operator of battery swapping technology having performed over 32 million battery swaps since then at more than 2,100 stations.

Now Stellantis, the global automaker that makes Jeep, Dodge and Fiat vehicles, is also trying out the idea on a small scale – with a crucial difference – in hopes of incorporating it in future EV models.

Stellantis is working with a company called Ample that has created a new battery swapping system it says can work in virtually any shape or size of vehicle. It says the system doesn’t require any automaker to alter its vehicle to fit a special battery pack.

With Ample’s system, the entire battery pack – which can weigh more than 1,000 pounds – doesn’t get replaced as a single unit. Instead, a number of individually sealed battery modules about the size of a desktop computer are taken out by automated machinery and replaced one by one. In this way, all the vehicle’s batteries can be quickly replaced in easily manageable chunks rather than in a single huge slab.

That means it might take five to, at most, 10 minutes to change batteries, depending on the size of the vehicle and how many modules there are, instead of the 90 seconds Musk had promised. But having separate small battery packs provides numerous advantages.

First, the equipment required to change the batteries can be small. Ample’s battery swap stations, which handle the work automatically, look like backyard sheds with an extra-thick wall. The wall is where the battery modules are stored and charged. There’s no need to dig a hole in the ground underneath the battery swapping station, either, as might be the case if the equipment needed to handle entire big, heavy battery packs.

Because the batteries don’t need high-powered DC fast charging – they have plenty of time to charge inside the hut wall – the battery swapping stations don’t require the kind of high-wattage power connections fast-charging stations do. That simplifies their installation, said Khaled Hassounah, founder and chief executive of Ample.

Also, the vehicle itself can be of any shape or size. An SUV, car or truck doesn’t need to be designed around an Ample battery pack. The battery modules fit into a container on the underside of the vehicle where a battery pack would usually go. The container is adapted to the size and shape of the vehicle. A large vehicle could simply hold more battery modules while a smaller vehicle would hold fewer of them.

Besides Stellantis, Ample is also working with heavy equipment maker Mitsubishi Fuso on a battery-swapping test with commercial trucks in Japan. In the United States, the system is being tested with a variety of different Uber vehicles around the San Francisco Bay area. Ample’s 12 battery-swapping stations in the Bay area are used “a few hundred” times a day, according to the company.

The Ample battery modules can still be charged in the vehicle at a regular EV charger, so drivers would have the option of either plugging in or swapping batteries depending on the situation. As usual, most EV owners could still plug their cars in overnight at home.

Stellantis has not said it will necessarily incorporate the system into its EV models for sale around the world. Next year, Stellantis will use the Ample battery swap system in a fleet of 100 Fiat 500e electric cars in Spain that are part of the company’s Free2Move car-sharing service.

The Fiat 500e, a tiny electric car with a range of about 150 miles, provides a perfect test case for battery swapping, said Ricardo Stamatti-Avila, Stellantis’s vice president for charging and energy.

“If you want to extend the range of a car, the answer right now is you just throw more batteries at it,” he said. “But when you have limited real estate, like in a Fiat 500, that means we’d need to make the car bigger, and then it’s not a Fiat 500 anymore, right?”

Even with larger vehicles, Ample’s battery swapping system could free drivers from having to buy lots of extra battery power they might only rarely use, as they do now. Customers could just rent the extra battery packs they need for the occasional long trip, said Stamatti-Avila.

If the system works well in Spain, he said, Stellantis will look first to commercial fleet customers to start building up an infrastructure of swapping stations. Ordinary retail customers could start using the system once there are a good number of swapping stations available.

On the other hand, if Stellantis’s Spanish experiment doesn’t pan out, this whole battery-swapping thing might just never be talked about again, as happened with Tesla.","['batteries', 'system', 'failed', 'vehicle', 'stellantis', 'battery', 'modules', 'ample', 'size', 'stations', 'swapping', 'vehicles', 'secret', 'tesla']","It seems like an obvious solution, but there have been some famous failures with battery swapping.

235,"Could the most magical time of year be so full of loneliness, anger and stress?","Editor’s note: Dr. Neha Chaudhary is a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and chief medical officer at Modern Health.

CNN —

As the holiday season approaches, many conjure up images of the perfect gathering: comforting aromas of home-cooked feasts, harmonious laughter between friends and family, and thoughts of gratitude that easily roll off the tongue.

But for some people, this time of year feels like the exact opposite. It’s a time of stress, emotional turmoil or intense loneliness that looks nothing like the traditional celebration of togetherness.

Sixty-six percent of people report feeling lonely at the holidays, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, while 64% of people with mental illness say that the holidays make their condition worse. And as a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist, I see these issues firsthand all too often.

Why are loneliness and emotional distress so common this time of year? Some people may be living far from family or may not be able to afford to travel to see them. Others may be grieving the loss of loved ones or navigating strained relationships — and the holidays can serve as a rude reminder of those losses. And for some, the holiday season brings families together who would rather be apart. Whatever the cause, the impact of the holidays on our mental health can be profound.

If this sounds like you, you’re clearly not alone. And if your experience at this time of year is the exact opposite, remember that your friends, colleagues or strangers may be having a hard time at the holidays.

Understanding and navigating loneliness

While the holiday season is portrayed as a time for family and social gatherings, that expectation can inadvertently amplify feelings of isolation. That’s true not only for those who find themselves alone, but also for those who are surrounded by loved ones.

The problem is loneliness is killing us — literally. According to the US surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, loneliness is as bad for your health as is smoking every day. It can increase your risk of mental health conditions, stroke, heart disease and even premature death.

Fortunately, there are ways to tackle the feeling. If you’ve been feeling lonely this holiday season, the first thing you can do is recognize and name it. Let the feeling roll in as if it’s a fleeting moment that will pass. If you try to resist a feeling, usually it will push back, staying longer than its welcome. If you allow the feeling to float on through you, it can float away just as easily as it came.

Next, see if you can pinpoint the source of the feeling. Do the holidays remind you of the loss of a loved one, or are they connected to a negative experience from your childhood? Or is it that you find yourself comparing yourself with others, only to feel like you aren’t measuring up to your own expectations, set by social comparison?

Once you identify the trigger for the emotion, you can try to talk to yourself about it with compassion as if you would talk to a friend. Remind yourself that it’s OK to grieve. Tell yourself that comparison is a distraction and put aside your social media. Or remind yourself that you can make investments in relationships if you really want to — you do have some control.

Lastly, find ways for connection with others in the moment. Is there a friend you haven’t texted in a while? A group activity you could join that leaves you with a sense of community? If you don’t have existing connections to turn to, having a brief interaction with a stranger can work as well. Chat with someone outside of your home or better yet offer to help or give something to a stranger. The sense of connection it can foster may surprise you. And it’s good for your health.

Gratitude, reflection and … anger?

While the focus of this time of year tends to be around reflection and gratitude, for some people it brings on a completely different feeling: anger. Anger toward family members who, when brought together, bring unresolved tensions up to the surface as a group. Anger toward loved ones who bailed on them many years ago. Or anger about life not going according to plan.

Sound like you? If so, put aside your self-judgment and let yourself feel. And then do something about it. What are ways you can share your anger that are respectful and constructive? Is there a conversation you can have with a loved one to work through hurt feelings from the past? If that doesn’t feel doable, consider writing your feelings down in a letter that you may never give the other person. Sometimes the act of getting it out of your brain and down on paper can feel like a welcome release. You can tear up the letter and throw it in the trash or flush it down the toilet, picturing the anger leaving you as you destroy the letter itself.

Handling the stress and pressure

Navigating the expectations and pressures set by society (and yourself) around the holidays can be similar to walking a tightrope. Whether it’s the expertly roasted turkey or picture-perfect family gatherings, idealized holiday movie and social media images can create a sense of pressure that might overshadow the essence of gratitude and togetherness. Ultimately, these unrealistic standards often lead to unnecessary stress and a sense of inadequacy for many people.

To break yourself out of the trap of comparison and never-ending expectations, start by acknowledging that perfection is an elusive goal and not the point of the holidays. Embrace imperfections. Try out new rituals and routines that are relaxed, goofy and inconsistent year to year, just for the sake of having fun.

Set boundaries with family and friends who have high expectations of you, whether it’s your aunt’s commentary on what you should wear to dinner, your mother’s criticism of your cooking, or your father-in-law’s comments about how you should be spending more time with that side of the family than you are. Practice in advance what you’re going to say to people when they push your boundaries.

The holiday blues

This holiday season is going to be hard for a lot of people, for a lot of different reasons. If uncomfortable feelings arise for you this holiday, I encourage you to hold space for them.

If you’re feeling low, give yourself a pass and turn your focus to ways you can take care of yourself and your mental health, whether it’s curling up under a blanket and binge-watching movies, writing in a journal, listening to music, expressing yourself through art or calling an old friend. Recognize what you need to survive this moment. And if nothing else is working, turn to a professional for help.

For many people, it will be the most wonderful time of the year. For others, it won’t. The more we encourage a culture of empathy and understanding around all the emotions that come with the holidays, the more we can strengthen our communities and lift each other up when it matters. And this might be one of the times of year that it matters most.

236,"In Miami Beach, a new street art installation celebrates the city’s vibrant drag scene","CNN —

The newest work of public art in Miami Beach, Florida, is an ode to drag. On Tuesday, city officials unveiled “Adora Vanessa Athena Fantasia,” a vibrant series of aluminum panels suspended over a block of the bustling Española Way shopping district. Each panel features a kaleidoscopic portrait inspired by local drag queens (including the four who inspired its title: Adora, Athena Dion, Fantasia Royale and Tiffany Fantasia), and is accompanied by a 30-foot-tall mural of dramatic manicures, doll-like eyelashes and full, pouty lips.

These quintessential elements in the art of drag come together as “a costume, a work outfit and a kind of armor in one,” said Persephone Von Lips, one of eleven queens who inspired the installation. “The hair, the makeup, the nails, the whole getup — when I put them on, I can walk down any street and feel the most beautiful and most confident I’ve ever been.”

“Adora Vanessa Athena Fantasia” is a work by Assume Vivid Astro Focus, or AVAF, an artist collective known for its multidisciplinary installations and psychedelic explosions of color. The City of Miami Beach commissioned the piece as the latest installment of Elevate Española, a semi-annual public art project launched in 2021.

Eli Sudbrack, the Brazilian artist who founded AVAF in New York some 20 years ago, wanted to pay tribute to Miami Beach’s bustling drag scene. He was motivated in large part by a law that Florida governor and Republican presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis signed in April, which sought to limit drag performances in the state.

Named the “Protection of Children Act” by its sponsors, the law threatened venues that admitted children into “adult live performances” — a phrase widely understood to mean drag — with fines, misdemeanor charges or revoked liquor licenses. In June, a district judge temporarily blocked the law on grounds that it would “suppress the speech of drag queen performers,” and the US Supreme Court declined the state’s request for a partial stay in November. Still, attorneys for the DeSantis administration are seeking to overturn the law’s temporary block in federal appeals court.

""Energizing the viewer always seems to be the intention of drag performances and that is also an important feature in our work,"" explained AVAF's Eli Sudbrack in a statement. City of Miami Beach Communications Department

Across the US, where at least a dozen other states have attempted to pass similar laws, drag remains a central topic in a larger culture war targeting LGBTQ rights.

“There’s still a fear in the back of our heads: What are they going to do next?” said Von Lips. Historically, the drag community has given refuge to trans and queer people rejected by society or their families, she added, “and I just think it’s insane that people are trying to take that away from us.”

The spectacle of drag

After AVAF was chosen for the Elevate Española commission earlier this year, the New York-based Sudbrack began his research online, reaching out to Tiffany Fantasia, a veteran on the Miami drag scene, to learn more about the local community. The artist also asked a friend in Miami to send him a list of iconic performers from both the South Beach and Downtown Miami scenes, which ultimately included the aforementioned queens, as well as Karla Croqueta, Juice Love Dion, Lady Paraiso, Power Infiniti, Regina Black and TP Lords.

Looking to the queens’ Instagrams for reference, Sudbrack said, “I started making drawings out of details of their personas: (the) makeup, lipstick, wigs and nails, so that the central panels are a mixture of different drag queens put together as a super powerful image.” The composite portraits of each panel represent the overall community rather than individuals, energized by the psychedelic hues and patterns for which AVAF is known.

Sudbrack’s mural, meanwhile, used the colors of the Progress Pride flag as its palette. The piece zooms in on features of individual queens — the faces of Athena Dion and TP Lords; the manicured hands of Regina Black, for example — rendering them in a cartoonish style of graphic outlines.

“It was very important, if I’m going to do a project in Miami right now, to honor this practice, no matter what,” Sudbrack said. “Our own practice has always been about self-expression and freedom, and the artistry of drag is about that — to be whoever you want to be.”

Lissette Garcia Arrogante, director of tourism and culture for the City of Miami Beach, said AVAF was an ideal choice for the commission, citing “all the vibrancy and vitality of the colors in their work.”

“Miami Beach proudly stands as one of the world’s most welcoming LGBTQ destinations, where the drag scene thrives despite Florida’s misguided efforts,” added Miami Beach Commissioner Alex Fernandez, reflecting on the work’s content. “We emphatically ‘elevate’ and celebrate diversity, resisting any attempts to dim our community’s spirit.”

Despite the governor’s efforts, Tiffany Fantasia said she’s confident in her right to remain in drag. “Anything is possible with these extreme Republicans, but we all know at the end of the day, it is not constitutional for them to do this type of stuff,” she said. “It’s a violation of freedom of expression”

238,These ‘dome homes’ made from soil mix tradition and innovation,"CNN —

In Morocco, a startup is building affordable homes using a material that is ubiquitous: soil.

Eco-dôme Maroc was founded in 2016. It applies local traditions to modern technology to construct dome-shaped buildings that it says are cheaper, more environmentally sustainable and more energy-efficient than regular concrete homes.

Founder Youness Ouazri says he discovered “a very rich tradition of earthen construction” used by previous generations while he was traveling around the country.

“We simply took this existing know-how and adjusted it to modern technologies to come up with a concept that is eco-friendly, cost effective and very rapid to implement,” he tells CNN.

Each home Eco-dôme builds is unique. Once the company receives an order, the first step is to analyze the soil composition on site to determine its suitability for construction.

Small quantities of lime or cement can be added for optimal performance, and thermal simulation models are run to ascertain the ideal thickness of the dome’s walls, so that it can absorb heat during the summer and release it during the winter. That means the building will use as little energy as possible for heating and cooling — sometimes none at all, says Ouazri, who trained as a civil engineer.

He adds that the eco-domes are much faster to build than a standard home. Prices range from around 2,500 Moroccan dirhams ($247) per square meter to 4,500 dirhams ($445), and can vary according to the soil and site. Ouazri says that can be a third cheaper than a standard home “mainly because we eliminate a big part of the raw materials that we’d need to acquire, since we are using local soil. We also eliminate the logistics associated with that, such as transporting materials to the site.”

Eco-dôme builds the homes using different techniques. One is called “superadobe,” which was devised in the 1980s by Iranian American architect Nader Khalili, and uses stacked polypropylene bags filled with soil. Other methods include using a wooden frame for the structures to obtain a rectangular, rather than round, floorplan.

The first Eco-dôme was completed in 2017. “It was a 775-square-feet house in a rural area near Rabat, the Moroccan capital, built for a client that uses it as a holiday house,” Ouazri says.

Since then, the company has built more than 100 domes across 40 different sites. The largest is a 2,700-square-foot cultural center in Agouim, 70 miles south-east of Marrakech, in an area with a harsh climate that swings from below freezing in winter to scorching hot in the summer.

‘Frugal innovation’

The company, which has received around $300,000 in investment to date and employs 17 people, has three main types of client, Ouazri says: “Land owners who want to build a primary or secondary home in the most ecological way possible; investors in rural tourism and eco-tourism; and local authorities and communities, to build schools or other infrastructure for education and healthcare.”

Eco-dôme now aims to start building in other countries and is looking at Tunisia and the Ivory Coast first.

Youssef El Ganadi, a professor of architecture at the International University of Rabat, who is not affiliated with Eco-dôme, says the project is an interesting “frugal innovation,” meant to make affordable homes for all social categories, and adds that it is sustainable.

However, he believes the uptake of the homes has been limited by a cultural barrier.

“Here in Morocco and in North Africa in general, many people have a mentality of wanting homes made of concrete, which they believe are more modern and robust,” he says. “That has limited the project to a niche, favored mainly by those with a certain sensibility to environmental causes and particularly for second homes.”

Ganadi also questions the earthquake resistance of superadobe domes. In September, Morocco was hit with a devastating quake that killed almost 3,000 people.

Ouzrai says attitudes are slowly changing. He adds that the Eco-dômes are built in compliance with local construction regulations, saying “buildings using superadobe or other earthen techniques are resilient to earthquakes” and that “four of our buildings were nearby the epicenter of the earthquake and stood still in front of it.”

“[Earth] lasts longer than industrialized materials,” Ouzrai says. “In certain regions in Morocco, we have buildings that were made thousands of years ago. With the appropriate maintenance, our domes can last forever.”

239,Pompeii archaeologists uncover bakery that doubled as prison,"Rome CNN —

An ancient bakery operated by slaves has been discovered in the ruins of Pompeii, the Pompeii Archaeological Park said in a statement released Friday.

Enslaved people and donkeys were locked up together and used to power a mill to grind grain for bread, according to details of the discovery provided by the park.

The site consists of a narrow room with no external view but only small, high windows covered by bars through which minimal light passed. There were also indentations in the floor “to coordinate the movement of the animals, forced to walk around for hours, blindfolded,” the statement said.

The discovery was made in the Regio IX section of the popular tourist site, which is also an ongoing archaeological dig. The area is currently being excavated as part of a larger project designed to secure and maintain previously excavated areas of the Roman city.

Archaeologists discovered the bakery while excavating an ancient Pompeiian home that was being renovated when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 C.E., covering the city of Pompeii with ash.

The bodies of three victims of the eruption were found in recent months, believed to be residents of the home rather than slaves. The house was divided into a residential section with “refined frescoes” on one side, and a commercial bakery on the other.

Next to the bakery was the dimly lit prison area, Pompeii Archaeological Park director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said in an interview posted on the site’s YouTube channel.

“What has emerged is testimony of the backbreaking work to which men, women, and animals were subjected in the ancient mill-bakeries,” he added.

Zuchtriegel said these prison bakeries were previously described by the Roman writer Apuleius in the 2nd century C.E., in his novel “Metamorphoses” (also known as “The Golden Ass”), in which the protagonist, Lucius, “transformed into a donkey and was sold to a miller.” Zuchtriegel said the episode was based on the writer’s direct knowledge of the animals and humans living and working together.

The newly discovered prison area had no doors to the outside, only to the inner atrium.

“It is, in other words, a space in which we must imagine the presence of people of servile status whose owner felt the need to limit the freedom of movement,” Zuchtriegel said.

“It is the most shocking side of ancient slavery, the side devoid of relationships of trust, where it was reduced to brute violence, an impression which is fully confirmed by the closing of the few windows with iron grates.”

Archaeologists also believe that the indentations in the slab flooring were not made by repetitive movement but were carved to prevent the donkeys and other animals from slipping on the pavement and to force them to only walk in a circular motion to grind the grain, almost like a clockwork mechanism.

“The iconographic and literary sources, in particular the reliefs from the tomb of Eurysaces in Rome, suggest that a millstone was normally moved by a couple made up of a donkey and a slave,” Zuchtriegel said.

“The latter, in addition to pushing the grindstone, had the task of encouraging the animal and monitoring the grinding process, adding grain and removing flour.”

The site will complement an exhibition that opens December 15, called “The Other Pompeii: common lives in the shadow of Vesuvius,” which is dedicated to what Zuchtriegel calls the “myriad of individuals often forgotten by historical chronicles, such as the slaves, who constituted the majority of the population and whose work contributed significantly to the economy, but also to the culture and social fabric of Roman civilization.”","['site', 'animals', 'area', 'prison', 'ancient', 'slaves', 'roman', 'archaeologists', 'uncover', 'zuchtriegel', 'pompeii', 'bakery', 'doubled']","Rome CNN —An ancient bakery operated by slaves has been discovered in the ruins of Pompeii, the Pompeii Archaeological Park said in a statement released Friday.

CNN —

In a court in Harris County, Texas, something remarkable happened this week: A woman and her husband asked a judge for an emergency order granting her permission to end a pregnancy.

Mary Zeigler Bill Lax/Bill Lax/FSU Photography Service

Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, had learned that the child she was carrying had full trisomy 18, a rare genetic condition that is almost always fatal. Her physicians have warned that continuing the pregnancy could put her at risk for life-threatening complications. Cox, who wants to have a third child, might also lose her ability to do so if forced to carry the pregnancy to term.

The judge granted Cox’s request on Thursday, but the state will almost certainly appeal to what is a Texas Supreme Court with nine Republican members. Late Friday, the Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocked the lower court’s ruling. But regardless of what happens next, Cox’s suit will shape the abortion debate going forward — not least because it is historic.

Cox is part of a new generation of plaintiffs telling heartbreaking stories about their experiences under criminal laws in places such as Texas, Idaho, Tennessee and Oklahoma — plaintiffs willing to speak out in a climate where support for abortion is at a record high, according to a WSJ-NORC poll, and some of the stigma surrounding abortion seems less intense. But given the popularity of abortion rights — and the obvious tragedy faced by women like Cox — why are states like Texas fighting so hard to defend their narrow exceptions?

The answer is that Cox’s case and others like it expose how unworkable abortion exceptions are under current law in states with virtual bans, especially when they are attached to harsh penalties like life in prison. Conceding that a woman like Cox is right could threaten to send much else about criminal abortion laws toppling down.

It is worth remarking on how rare Cox’s suit is. Before Roe v. Wade, patients and doctors both questioned the constitutionality of abortion laws. In some cases, pregnant patients were named plaintiffs: This was the case for Norma McCorvey, the “Roe” in Roe v. Wade, and Sandra Cano, the plaintiff in Roe’s companion case, Doe v. Bolton. These suits adjudicated whether a law was permissible, but often did not change what happened to a particular pregnant plaintiff (McCorvey, for example, famously carried what some called the “Roe baby” to term). After Roe, minors acting without parental consent or notification sought court-ordered abortion under what were called “judicial bypass” laws, often also while maintaining anonymity.

Cox’s case is quite different. She is an adult, not a minor, and she has not concealed her identity. Her willingness to tell her story is no doubt due to her own strength and commitment, but our present political moment likely has something to do with it too. Poll after poll find strong, if not unprecedented, support for legal abortion, even in states where abortion bans are already in effect. Backlash to these bans — and to the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization — has made it easier for other women to describe their own experiences with criminal laws and to file suits of their own.

McCorvey and Cano used pseudonyms at a time when pursuing abortion rights might have come at great personal and political cost. Women like Cox and Amanda Zurawski, who is challenging the validity of Texas’s medical emergency exception to abortion, use their own names, and do so with the knowledge that most Americans support legal abortion — and all the more so in cases like theirs.

When states fight plaintiffs like Cox and Zurawski in court, it hardly helps Republicans already on the defensive about abortion. It is comparably easy to paint bans as heartless and extreme when the state shows no sympathy for women who stand to lose their fertility, health or lives.

Suits like Cox’s expose how hard it would be to devise a workable abortion exception. In theory, a functioning exception would advance the state’s interest in fetal life while offering a real opportunity for people in exceptional cases that the state deems deserving. But if a state requires harsh punishment — Texas, for example, authorizes life in prison for abortion — few doctors will be willing to gamble that they are interpreting the law correctly, even if an exception is relatively clear.

Most exceptions, it turns out, aren’t clear anyway, written not by physicians but by lawmakers who use the language of criminal law, and sometimes write more than one exception into various criminal abortion laws, as in Oklahoma. The broader and more compassionate a state makes an exception, the higher the odds that more plaintiffs like Cox will prevail, but that will require deference to patients and physicians that anti-abortion states focused on punishing abortion providers reject as a matter of principle.

Exceptions almost always leave out other tragic circumstances. Texas has a medical emergency exception, but dismisses a fatal fetal abnormality that could deprive Cox of the ability to have a third child as nothing different than what is experienced by “countless women who give birth every day.” The risk of death, the state says, is simply “not imminent” enough. Andy Beshear, the Democratic governor of Kentucky, just made anger about a similar provision in his state’s law a central message of his successful reelection campaign.

Republican lawmakers often seem to want it both ways on abortion. They define themselves as pro-life but insist on compassion for women, especially in the so-called hard cases like Cox’s.

But what is happening in Texas complicates that narrative. Texas purports to value fetal life and women’s health — but then denies that the unborn have rights when that strategy will help defeat a lawsuit brought by a prison employee forced to stay at her post who lost her pregnancy. Texas claims compassion for women but requires that their lives or a major bodily function be at imminent risk before a doctor can step in. And Texas claims to protect life by forcing a woman like Cox to carry a child who almost certainly won’t live while threatening her ability to have a child who will.

All of this is a reminder of the priorities of state abortion laws, which are not about the value of life in the womb, but about criminal punishment — and about crafting exceptions that will rarely, if ever, be used. Cox’s suit matters because it is historic, but also because of what it tells us. When the chips are down, given a choice between protecting women like Cox and criminalizing those who offer abortions, we know what states like Texas will choose every time.","['exposing', 'exception', 'laws', 'truth', 'texas', 'states', 'women', 'opinion', 'life', 'law', 'chilling', 'woman', 'abortion', 'cox', 'state', 'roe']","Conceding that a woman like Cox is right could threaten to send much else about criminal abortion laws toppling down.

242,‘Turtwig’ ancient turtle species discovered after fossil mystery solved,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Ancient plant fossils that puzzled scientists have turned out not to be plants after all, new research has revealed.

Instead, the small round shapes bearing a leaflike pattern were once the shells of baby turtles that lived during the time of dinosaurs. Scientists have nicknamed the turtle species “Turtwig,” after a Pokémon character that is half-turtle, half-plant.

The discovery marks the first time baby turtle carapaces have been found in northwestern South America, according to the study authors.

The results of their research were published Thursday in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.

“In the Pokémon universe, you encounter the concept of combining two or more elements, such as animals, machines, plants, etc.,” said lead author Héctor Palma-Castro, a graduate student of paleobotany at the National University of Colombia, in a statement.

“So, when you have a fossil initially classified as a plant that turns out to be a baby turtle, a few Pokémon immediately come to mind. In this case, Turtwig, a baby turtle with a leaf attached to its head.”

But it took some sleuthing to solve this paleontological mystery that began decades ago.

Wrong place, wrong time

It all started when Colombian priest Padre Gustavo Huertas discovered the fossils in the Paja Formation. The formation is part of one of Colombia’s geological heritage sites called the Marine Reptile Lagerstätte of the Ricaurte Alto.

Previous fossil discoveries from the site include dinosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, ichthyosaurs, turtles and crocodile relatives called crocodylopmorphs dated from the Early Cretaceous Period, between 113 million and 132 million years ago.

Huertas collected fossils and rocks at the site, near the town of Villa de Leyva, from the 1950s to the 1970s. When he found the leaf-patterned rocks, he deemed them a fossil plant. Huertas went on to describe the specimens as Sphenophyllum colombianum in a 2003 study.

But other scientists were surprised to hear that the plant was discovered in northern South America and dated between 113 million and 132 million years ago. The now-extinct plant, once prevalent around the world, died out more than 100 million years earlier, according to the fossil record.

Previous research about the plant showed that its leaves were typically wedge-shaped with veins that radiated out from the base of the leaf.

The age and location of the fossils intrigued Palma-Castro and Fabiany Herrera, the assistant curator of paleobotany at the Negaunee Integrative Research Center at Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History.

Herrera collects and studies plants from the Early Cretaceous Period (100.5 million to 145 million years ago) in northwestern South America, a part of the continent where little paleobotanical research takes place.

Both fossils, about 2 inches (5 centimeters) in diameter, were housed in collections at the National University of Colombia’s department of geosciences. As Herrera and Palma-Castro examined and photographed the fossils, they thought something seemed strange.

“When you look at it in detail, the lines seen on the fossils don’t look like the veins of a plant — I was positive that it was most likely bone,” said Herrera, the study’s senior author, in a statement.

Solving a fossil mystery

Herrera contacted his colleague Edwin-Alberto Cadena, a senior lecturer and paleontologist who studies turtles and other vertebrates at Del Rosario University in Bogotá, Colombia.

“They sent me the photos, and I said, ‘This definitely looks like a carapace’ — the bony upper shell of a turtle,” said Cadena, a study coauthor, in a statement. “I said, ‘Well, this is remarkable, because this is not only a turtle, but it’s also a hatchling specimen, it’s very, very small.’”

Cadena and one of his students, Diego Cómbita-Romero at the National University of Colombia, compared the fossils with the shells of other extinct and modern turtles.

“When we saw the specimen for the first time I was astonished, because the fossil was missing the typical marks on the outside of a turtle’s shell,” said study coauthor Cómbita-Romero in a statement. “It was a little bit concave, like a bowl. At that moment we realized that the visible part of the fossil was the other side of the carapace, we were looking at the part of the shell that is inside the turtle.”

During their analysis of the shells, the researchers determined that the turtles were about 1 year old at the most when they died.

As young turtles develop, their growth rates and sizes can vary, Cómbita-Romero said. But it’s rare to find remains of young turtles because the bones in their shells are so thin.

“These turtles were likely relatives of other Cretaceous species that were up to fifteen feet long, but we don’t know much about how they actually grew to such giant sizes,” Cadena said in a statement.

The researchers didn’t blame Huertas for mistakenly categorizing the fossils as plants. What he believed to be leaves and stems were the vertebrae and rib bones within a turtle’s shell.

“We resolved a small paleobotanical mystery, but more importantly, this study shows the need to re-study historical collections in Colombia. The Early Cretaceous is a critical time in land plant evolution,” Herrera said.

The research team next aims to uncover the forests that once grew in the region, he said.

“In paleontology, your imagination and capacity to be amazed are always put to the test,” Palma-Castro said. “Discoveries like these are truly special because they not only expand our knowledge about the past but also open a window to the diverse possibilities of what we can uncover.”","['turtles', 'plant', 'million', 'shells', 'species', 'university', 'solved', 'fossils', 'turtwig', 'ancient', 'fossil', 'discovered', 'mystery', 'study', 'turtle', 'research']","CNN —Ancient plant fossils that puzzled scientists have turned out not to be plants after all, new research has revealed.

243,Woman who threw bowl of food at Chipotle worker sentenced to work 2 months in fast food job,"New York CNN —

A woman who threw a bowl of hot food in the face of a Chipotle worker has been sentenced to a month in jail — and two months working a fast food job.

Videos of the woman, Rosemary Hayne, berating Chipotle worker Emily Russell on September 5 and then throwing the food in her face at close range, went viral after the incident. Hayne, a 39-year old mother of four, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge and received the sentence last week in the Parma, Ohio, municipal court. Judge Timothy Gilligan gave her the choice of a 90-day jail sentence or a 30-day sentence on top of 60 days working in a fast food job.

“Do you want to walk in her shoes for two months and learn how people should treat people, or do you want to do your jail time?” Gilligan asked Hayne at the hearing.

“I’d like to walk in her shoes,” Hayne responded.

Hayne has yet to find the job, Gilligan and her attorney told CNN on Wednesday. Her attorney, Joseph O’Malley, said his client had no criminal record before the incident and that she is truly sorry for her actions that day.

“Let’s give her the opportunity to not let this one day define the rest of her life,” he told CNN.

Gilligan said Hayne will have to have her job approved by the court, and will have to work there 20 hours a week. O’Malley said Hayne does not currently have a job.

Gilligan told CNN he thought about the possible unusual sentence a couple of days before the November hearing.

“Every time you watch the video, it makes you more and more upset,” he said. “I was thinking, ‘What else can I do rather than just have her sit in jail.’”

Asked if he would want to hire Hayne if he ran a fast food restaurant, the judge said he doesn’t think she’ll have trouble finding a job.

“I don’t see her as any greater risk than anyone who walks in off the street,” he said. “I looked at it as someone who lost her cool.”

Gilligan said it’s the first time he’s handed down this kind of sentence, but unfortunately it’s the not the first incident of this kind to come before him. He said there was one case a couple of years ago in which a customer who didn’t get a cookie in a Happy Meal at a McDonald’s reached through the drive-thru window and started punching a worker. That defendant got 90 days in jail, he said.

“I see these cases more than I want to,” said Gilligan, who has been a judge for 30 years.

Asked for a comment on the case, Chipotle responded: “The health and safety of our employees is our greatest priority, and we’re pleased to see justice served for any individual that does not treat our team members with the respect they deserve.”

Hayne declined a request for an interview made through O’Malley. Russell told the court that she is still dealing with stress from the incident, and that she quit the job at Chipotle after the attack and found another job. She said she would like to begin counseling to deal with the trauma she is still experiencing from the attack.

One of Russell’s friends started a fundraising effort on social media for her and it has raised $7,300 so far, with most of that money coming since the first news reports about Hayne’s sentence last week. Russell told WJW in Cleveland that she was pleased with Hayne’s sentence.

“She’s going to get what she deserves,” she told the station. “She didn’t get a slap on the wrist. She’s going to learn to work in fast food, and hopefully it will be good.”

In addition to the jail time and time spent working in fast food, Hayne will have to pay a $250 fine and will be on probation for two years. Gilligan told CNN he’s not sure Hayne is as sorry as she claimed to be in court, pointing out that she was still complaining about the food during the hearing.

“She still has not picked up that this is not appropriate,” Gilligan told CNN Wednesday.

“You didn’t get your burrito bowl the way you like it, and this is how you respond?” he told Hayne during the hearing. He suggested she’s not going to be happy with the food she’s about to get in jail.","['fast', 'job', 'jail', 'food', 'cnn', 'months', 'woman', 'chipotle', 'hayne', 'work', 'worker', 'threw', 'told', 'gilligan', 'sentenced', 'incident', 'sentence']","New York CNN —A woman who threw a bowl of hot food in the face of a Chipotle worker has been sentenced to a month in jail — and two months working a fast food job.

244,"Harvard, Penn and MIT presidents under fire over ‘despicable’ testimony on antisemitism and genocide","New York CNN —

The presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania faced intense scrutiny on Wednesday from business leaders, donors and politicians following their testimony at a House hearing on antisemitism on campus and calls for genocide in Israel.

The criticism focused on the university leaders’ answers to questions on Tuesday about whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates their respective school’s code of conduct on bullying or harassment.

None of the school leaders explicitly said that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a post on X he was “ashamed” to hear the testimony, calling it “one of the most despicable moments in the history of US academia.”

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, speaking outside a falafel shop in Philadelphia that had been targeted by protesters, called Penn President Liz Magill’s statements “unacceptable” and “shameful.”

Shapiro called for the UPenn board of trustees to meet and discuss whether Magill’s testimony represents the values of the university and board.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told CNN’s MJ Lee Wednesday that calls for genocide at universities were “unacceptable.”

Private equity billionaire Marc Rowan wrote a message to Penn trustees saying he heard from hundreds of alumni, parents and leaders who were shocked by the hearing, including at least one who hoped the hearing was fake.

“Unfortunately, this is not fake and the University is suffering tremendous reputational damage,” Rowan wrote in the message, obtained by CNN. “How much damage to our reputation are we willing to accept?”

Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman called for Harvard President Claudine Gay, MIT President Sally Kornbluth and the University of Pennsylvania’s President Liz Magill to “resign in disgrace,” citing disgust with their testimony.

“Throughout the hearing, the three behaved like hostile witnesses,” Ackman wrote in a post on X, “exhibiting a profound disdain for the Congress with their smiles and smirks, and their outright refusal to answer basic questions with a yes or no answer.”

Ackman, a Harvard graduate who has been a vocal critic of how universities have addressed antisemitism, posted a clip from the exchange at the hearing where the university leaders were asked about calls for the genocide of Jews.

“They must all resign in disgrace. If a CEO of one of our companies gave a similar answer, he or she would be toast within the hour,” Ackman said on X. “The answers they gave reflect the profound moral bankruptcy of Presidents Gay, Magill and Kornbluth.”

In response to Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik asking whether calling for the genocide of Jews would violate Penn’s code of conduct, Penn President Magill said: “It is a context dependent decision.”

Stefanik responded with shock.

“That’s your testimony today? Calling for the genocide of Jews is dependent on the context? That is not bullying or harassment? This is the easiest question to answer yes for,” Stefanik said.

Ackman strongly criticized the response.

“Why has antisemitism exploded on campus and around the world? Because of leaders like Presidents Gay, Magill and Kornbluth who believe genocide depends on the context,” Ackman said.

The criticism of the university leaders was so strong that Harvard and Penn felt compelled to issue new statements attempting to clarify the testimony.

“There are some who have confused a right to free expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for violence against Jewish students,” Gay said in the new statement posted on X. “Let me be clear: Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.”

In a short video released Wednesday night, Magill echoed Gay’s response and said the university would immediately review and clarify its policies on hate speech.

“I was not focused on – but I should have been – the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It’s evil. Plain, and simple,” Magill said in a video posted on X. “I want to be clear: A call for genocide of Jewish people … would be harassment or intimidation.”

Magill noted antisemitic speech is designed to threaten and terrify Jews and remind them of the Holocaust, pogroms and other recent acts of violence against them.

“As president, I’m committed to a safe, secure and supportive environment so all members of our community can thrive,” Magill added. “We can – and we will – get this right.”

Representatives at MIT were not immediately available to respond to the criticism.

Condemning Harvard but forgiving Musk

Ackman has been publicly feuding with Harvard’s administration and some students over reports of rising antisemitism on campus. In an open letter last month, he said Harvard’s lack of action to rein in antisemitism threatened its funding from donors. And he called on the university to publicly name students who were members of student groups that blamed Israel for Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.

However, Ackman has gone easy on fellow billionaire Elon Musk, who endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X, leading to a revolt from advertisers. Ackman defended Musk in a post on X last week, saying, “After examining the facts, it was clear to me that Musk did not have antisemitic intent” when Musk said a conspiracy theory that Jews were trying to replace White people with immigrants was “the actual truth.”

Musk has since apologized for his post, calling it his “worst” and “dumbest” social media post.

The White House weighs in

The White House issued a full-throated condemnation of any calls for genocide Wednesday, just one day after the controversial remarks made by the presidents of Harvard, MIT and UPenn.

“What I will say is that is something that we do not stand for. We do not stand for calls for genocide, that is unacceptable, that is vile, we will call that out,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told CNN’s MJ Lee Wednesday, adding that, were administration staff found to have called for genocide, they’d be held to account.

But Jean-Pierre declined to say why university presidents testifying on Capitol Hill were unable to similarly say whether antisemitic or pro-genocide statements run afoul of their respective college codes of conduct.

“I can’t speak for those presidents, I cannot—they have to speak for themselves on this,” she said.

And she wouldn’t say if the university heads should resign following Tuesday’s backlash.

“That is not for us to decide on,” Jean-Pierre said. “Because they each… some of them are private universities, right? They have their own process, we do not get involved in private university’s process and how they run their university.”

Commitment to free speech

At one point during Tuesday’s hearing Stefanik asked Gay if the Ivy League school would punish students or applicants who say, “from the river to the sea” or “intifada.”

Gay explained that type of “hateful, reckless, offensive speech” is “abhorrent” to her.

“Do you believe that type of hateful speech is contrary to Harvard’s code of conduct or is it allowed at Harvard?” Stefanik, who graduated from Harvard, pressed Gay.

“It is at odds with the value of Harvard, but … we embrace a commitment to free expression even of views that are objectionable, offensive, hateful,” Gay said.

David Weild, a former chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market, said there should be no wavering when students feel threatened.

“I can’t believe we are having this conversation in the US Congress,” Weild said in a post on LinkedIn. “I’m a Christian. Shut the hate speech down on all sides. People deserve to feel and be safe.”","['mit', 'leaders', 'presidents', 'despicable', 'university', 'calls', 'penn', 'x', 'president', 'testimony', 'antisemitism', 'harvard', 'students', 'magill', 'genocide']","New York CNN —The presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania faced intense scrutiny on Wednesday from business leaders, donors and politicians following their testimony at a House hearing on antisemitism on campus and calls for genocide in Israel.

245,The minimum wage is increasing in more than 20 states in 2024,"New York CNN —

At the start of the new year, anyone working a minimum wage job will be paid more in 22 states and in at least 40 cities and counties across the country.

The higher hourly rates are due either to scheduled increases or lawmakers having indexed the minimum wage in their jurisdiction to inflation, most typically using the Consumer Price Index as their gauge.

Come January 1, seven states and the District of Columbia will have minimum wages of $15 or more, up from just four states plus DC this year. The newcomers to the category are Maryland, New Jersey and most of New York State (with the exception of New York City, Westchester and Long Island, which already had a $15 minimum in place and where the minimum wage is increasing to $16 in the new year).

The highest state minimum wage in 2024 will be Washington state, at $16.28, up from $15.74 currently. A close second is California, which is raising its minimum to $16 from $15.50 today.

The state with the biggest jump in its minimum wage next year will be Hawaii, which is hiking it by $2.

January 1 isn’t the only day minimum wages will go up. Some states, such as Nevada and Oregon, have increases set for July 1. Florida’s minimum will go up on September 30.

(See the full list of states increasing their minimum wages below.)

Cities, counties and some industries often trump state minimums

States’ minimum wage rates are often eclipsed by those in many of their own cities and counties.

Take the city of Tukwila, Washington, just south of Seattle. Its minimum wage will hit $20.29 in January, up from $18.99 now. At that level it will have the highest standard minimum wage rate in the country among states, counties and cities on January 1, said Jana Bjorklund, senior counsel and director of employment law and compliance at GovDocs, a compliance software provider for large, multi-jurisidiction employers.

Seattle, which will have a rate of $19.97, won’t be far behind.

Next year, at least 40 cities and counties are hiking their minimum wages, according to GovDocs. They include Flagstaff, Arizona (to $17.40); Mountain View, California (to $18.85); Denver, Colorado (to $18.29) and Portland, Maine (to $15).

And in some states, there are big sector-specific wage hikes on tap. In California, for instance, starting in April, fast food workers must be paid at least $20 an hour, and on June 1, healthcare workers will start earning between $18 and $23 an hour depending on their role and the size and type of employer they work for – an hourly rate that will eventually reach $25.

In New York City, app-based restaurant delivery workers (e.g., those working for Uber, Grubhub and DoorDash) now must be paid a minimum hourly rate of $17.96, which is set to increase to $19.96 by 2025.

The push for non-poverty wages

The federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009. And 20 states – including Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Alabama and Mississippi – still adhere to it.

The push to raise it has gone on for years because minimum wage workers stuck at $7.25 have lost substantial buying power.

Had it just been adjusted for inflation since 2009, it would be $10.33 today. But advocates for a higher minimum wage, including Holly Sklar, CEO of Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, would rather see it adjusted for inflation from where it was in 1968. The wage then was $1.60, which in today’s dollars would be $14.39. That $1.60 provided minimum wage workers with their greatest purchasing power, Sklar said. “Every minimum wage increase since 1968 has been too little too late. … Full-time jobs used to keep people out of poverty.”

She points to MIT’s living wage calculator to assess what a single person without kids would have to earn per hour just to cover the cost of basic needs (e.g., food, housing, transportation and medical care).

For example, in Mississippi, where the minimum wage is just $7.25, a person would have to earn $15.30 an hour in Pike County just to pay for basic needs. But among childcare workers, fast food cooks and cashiers in the state, the median wage (meaning half of people in those jobs earn less) ranges between $9.83 and $10.17 an hour, Sklar noted.

Given how little movement there has been at the federal level to raise the country’s minimum wage sufficiently, she expects states and local jurisdictions will continue to do the heavy lifting.

And she believes the economic case for their increases is there for both workers and employers.

For workers, of course, “It eases the burden,” Sklar said. “People replace tires they couldn’t replace or get their kids clothes.”

For businesses, she said, consumer spending goes up because minimum wage workers will spend their additional earnings quickly. And among other things, it will help boost retention of one’s workers because they won’t be as quick to quit for another 25 cents an hour. Less turnover, in turn, can reduce an employer’s hiring and training costs, among other benefits.

“It’s a virtuous cycle,” Sklar said.

246,Here’s why gas could drop below $3,"New York CNN —

The sell-off in the oil market accelerated Wednesday, with US crude prices sinking below $70 a barrel for the first time since July.

The latest wave of selling bodes well for consumers, suggesting gas prices could fall even closer towards $3 a gallon nationally.

Gas prices bottomed out at $3.10 a gallon in late December last year just before Christmas. The national average hasn’t been below $3 since May 2021.

US crude tumbled to as low as $69.11 a barrel on Wednesday, the lowest intraday level since June 29. Oil closed at $69.38 a barrel, down 4.1% on the day. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 3.8% to $74.25 a barrel.

Analysts said the selloff is being driven by a confluence of factors, including concerns about soft demand in China, record-setting supply from the United States and disappointment over last week’s OPEC+ decision.

“The market has fallen off quite rapidly,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates. “It could really be interpreted as OPEC+ losing its ability to control prices.”

Last week, OPEC+ members agreed to supply cuts but that agreement was met with skepticism because of the voluntary nature of the move.

“The OPEC+ production cuts appear to be more style than substance,” Lipow said.

All of this is welcome news for consumers. Even before Wednesday’s oil sell-off, the national average price for regular gas fell to $3.22 a gallon, according to AAA. That’s a fresh 11-month low and well below the peak in September of $3.88.

Gas prices are likely to decline another 5 to 7 cents a gallon in the next week, according to Lipow. He said while new turmoil in the Middle East or a Venezuelan takeover of Guyana could revive oil prices, there is a growing chance that US gas prices will drop towards $3 a gallon nationally.

Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities, described Wednesday’s sell-off as a “meltdown.” New federal data, revealing a large increase in weekly gasoline inventories, caused concern about weak energy demand, according to Yawger.","['according', 'drop', 'oil', 'gallon', 'heres', 'gas', 'crude', 'selloff', 'barrel', 'lipow', 'opec', 'prices']","The latest wave of selling bodes well for consumers, suggesting gas prices could fall even closer towards $3 a gallon nationally.

247,The Washington Post braces for historic 24-hour strike as journalists protest staff cuts and contract frustrations,"CNN —

Hundreds of staffers at The Washington Post are set to strike for 24 hours on Thursday, protesting recently announced cuts to the newspaper’s workforce and applying pressure on management to reach an agreement on a new union contract.

“Taking this historic action is not a decision we came to lightly,” The Washington Post Guild said in a letter to readers. “We take seriously the impact it will have on the people, issues and communities we cover.”

A protest of such magnitude has not been staged at The Post since the 1970s, according to the union, signaling how frustrated members are with the state of affairs at the Jeff Bezos-owned newspaper.

The union, which represents roughly 1,000 employees at The Post, has been negotiating a new contract with executives for 18 months, but it has yet to arrive at an agreement, much to the dismay of members who have expressed significant frustration with management over the process.

A spokesperson for The Post said in a statement that the newspaper respects the right of its employees to strike.

“We will make sure our readers and customers are as unaffected as possible,” the spokesperson said. “The Post’s goal remains the same as it has from the start of our negotiations: to reach an agreement with the Guild that meets the needs of our employees and the needs of our business.”

The labor dispute comes as The Post struggles financially, with the paper on track to lose approximately $100 million this year. To that end, The Post’s management team has moved to cut costs, announcing in October that it aims to slash its workforce by 10% through voluntary buyouts.

Patty Stonesifer, The Post’s interim chief executive, disclosed to employees when announcing the buyouts that the company had “overshot on expenses” and that management needed to “right size” the business.

Last week, Stonesifer warned employees that if 240 people do not volunteer for the buyout offer, layoffs would ensue. Stonesifer said in a meeting this week that 175 employees had so far taken the buyout offers ahead of next week’s deadline.

Staffers at The Post have balked at the need for cuts, often pointing out that the newspaper is owned by Bezos, one of the richest men in the world. Bezos has stressed that he wants The Post to be financially solvent.

During the 24-hour work stoppage, The Guild has encouraged readers to avoid reading or sharing The Post’s editorial content.

“On Dec. 7, we ask you to respect our walkout by not crossing the picket line: For 24 hours, please do not engage with any Washington Post content,” the Guild said. “That includes our print and online news stories, podcasts, videos, games and recipes.”

Meanwhile, management is working to ensure that The Post continues to deliver news to its readers during the strike. The newspaper will likely rely on its editors, who are not members of the union, to author stories.

The Post is far from the only news institution engaged in a labor dispute with its employees. Unionized staffers at Condé Nast have been protesting layoffs at the publishing company.

248,McDonald’s CEO: Bigger burgers are coming,"New York CNN —

McDonald’s has a burger strategy to spark growth in the next few years. That strategy can be boiled down to one word: More.

“In the US, in a number of markets, around the world, having a larger burger is an opportunity,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told CNN in an interview.

“We’re working on that,” he added. “That is something that you should expect in the future.”

It’s not just more burger in your burger. It’s more everything. The burger chain plans to open thousands more restaurants. It wants to add 100 million members to its loyalty program, which nudges customers into spending more. And it’s investing in more marketing campaigns to get people craving its burgers and fries — and, increasingly, chicken sandwiches, too.

Bigger burgers

McDonald’s has already been working on a plan to improve how its burger tastes. But it’s learned that in addition to softer buns and gooeyer cheese, people also want a more sizable burger.

“We’ve listened to our customers. And we understand their desire for larger, high-quality burgers that fill you up,” said Jo Sempels, who oversees markets where McDonald’s has licensed its brand, during an investor event on Wednesday.

McDonald’s plans to test options in limited markets and, once it finds the best one, roll it out more broadly, Sempels said.

That’s a similar approach to how McDonald’s landed on the McCrispy chicken sandwich, after failing for years to come up with the right recipe and branding. Now, Sempels noted, chicken amounts for $25 billion in annual sales across the system, just like beef.

McDonald’s plan for bigger burgers comes at a time when many customers are looking for ways to spend less — and as a pricey McDonald’s burger has become something of a symbol of inflation.

But the coming burger, though bigger, shouldn’t break the bank. “We think we’re going to be able to deliver a great tasting large burger at a superior value to what [customers] can get anywhere else,” Kempczinski said.

More restaurants

In addition to selling larger burgers, McDonald’s wants to be everywhere.

The burger chain plans to have 50,000 locations globally by 2027, it said in a release Wednesday. As of September 30, there were roughly 41,000 McDonald’s establishments in all.

The increase would be “the fastest period of growth in company history,” McDonald’s said in a statement.

It may seem like the global market is already saturated with fast food restaurants. But McDonald’s doesn’t see it that way: As humanity changes, the company should too — and add more restaurants, so it can maximize sales in all areas.

“With our current size and scale, some in this room might be questioning whether there is truly more space to grow,” said Manu Steijaert, the company’s global chief customer officer, during Wednesday’s event. “I’m here to tell you we see an incredible opportunity to grow the business by building more locations, getting us even closer to our customers.”

And being physically closer to customers really does matter to McDonald’s. People could get to a McDonald’s more quickly, of course. But it also means the McDonald’s can get to them more quickly, too, with shorter wait and delivery times.

The company has been looking at population forecasts in addition to “a hyper local understanding of customer demands,” to help determine how it should grow, Steijaert said.

Adding 9,000 locations in about three years will mark a sea change in the company’s pace of growth. The first McDonald’s opened in 1940. It took until the early 1970s to get to 10,000 locations, Steijaert said. And it only hit the 40,000 milestone in 2021.

Kempczinski spoke about the company’s need to evolve earlier this year.

“Our footprint reflects what the population looks like probably 20 or 30 years ago,” Kempczinski said of the company’s domestic footprint during an analyst call in July. “There’s a number of places around the US where we are significantly underdeveloped relative to where the population exists today. That opens up for us a whole bunch of development opportunities for us to go after,” he said.

Along with geographical changes, the company is also considering how the very idea of what a McDonald’s is should change as well.

Kempczinski added at the time that the company can now “[think] about small format,” because “of the growth that’s happened with the digital and delivery, where you don’t necessarily need the big dining rooms that you needed in our traditional restaurants.”

Over the summer, McDonald’s said it was testing out a new restaurant concept called “CosMc’s,” named after a little-known McDonald’s character.

As McDonald’s scales up, it’s still planning to stick to its regular formats, Kempczinski told CNN on Wednesday.

“The vast majority of what we’re going to build are going to be our traditional restaurants,” he said, which includes a dining room and a drive-thru, as well as spaces for pickup. “There probably will be some restaurants that are drive-thru and delivery only,” he said, “but that’s going to be the minority.”

More loyalty program users

In addition to the new locations, McDonald’s wants to significantly expand its loyalty program, taking it from 150 million to 250 million 90-day active users by 2027.

Loyalty programs let companies learn more about their customers’ preferences and allow them to offer specific deals that may help prevent them from going to competitors.

Getting people to commit to McDonald’s by joining a loyalty program is as important as expanding geographically, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald’s USA, said during Wednesday’s investor event.

“Historically, the number of our locations was our competitive advantage at McDonald’s,” Erlinger said Wednesday. “In the future, data will sit alongside restaurant locations as another significant competitive advantage.” Loyalty members visit restaurants more often and spend more than other customers, he noted.

A big part of the app will be about personalization fueled by artificial intelligence, Kempzcinski told CNN. On Wednesday, the company announced a partnership with Google, focusing on artificial intelligence. AI will be used behind the scenes, according to the company, and also to recommend food to customers based on what they like.

More marketing

“Maximizing our marketing remains a meaningful growth opportunity,” said Jill McDonald, who is in charge of wholly-owned international markets, during Wednesday’s event.

Marketing, she said, is driving higher sales at restaurants open at least 13 months.

One example of McDonald’s marketing success: the Grimace shake.

When McDonald’s introduced the shake, it probably didn’t expect the item to go viral on TikTok quite like it did: with TikTokers showing themselves sipping the dessert drink and then, soon after, writhing in mock pain or playing dead. But the mini horror films inspired people to buy shakes (if only to make more videos).

“One of the things that we’ve been hearing from our fans is a curiosity and an excitement about some of these characters that we’ve had in our history,” Kempzcinski told CNN. “When you do it the right way, it quickly becomes part of culture.”","['coming', 'ceo', 'growth', 'loyalty', 'going', 'restaurants', 'customers', 'locations', 'bigger', 'cnn', 'mcdonalds', 'burger', 'burgers', 'company']","New York CNN —McDonald’s has a burger strategy to spark growth in the next few years.

249,"This US bought a house in France for $20,000 without seeing it","CNN —

Her fascination with France began when she spent a summer in the European country while working as an au pair back back in the 1970s.

From then on, Ellen, originally from the East Coast of the US, made it her mission to travel to France whenever she got the chance to.

She met her now husband Joseph, from the West Coast, in the late 1970s and the couple went on to marry and have three children, continuing to travel to the country as a family once every two years or so.

“It’s funny, Joseph and our daughter would tease me, because anytime we were planning a vacation, I always wanted to come to France,” Ellen admits.

“They liked France too, but they would say, ‘Can we go somewhere else?’ [I would say,] ‘Yes, as long as we stop in Paris first or something like that.’ So, it was a compromise usually.”

‘Half house’

Ellen and her husband Joseph came across a rundown home in the historic village of Lonlay l'Abbaye in Normandy and purchased it unseen. Ellen and Joseph A.

Although Ellen and Joseph, who have chosen not to disclose their surname, had been toying with the prospect of moving to France for years, it wasn’t until they were both approaching retirement age that they began seriously thinking about buying a property there.

Ellen came across a tiny rundown home in the historic village of Lonlay l’Abbaye in Normandy, northern France, while browsing French real estate online, back in 2014.

“The house was affordable,” says Joseph, who previously worked as a business executive. “It was obviously a bit of a ruin. But it was within our budget.

“And that was always foremost in our minds. What can we budget? How much should we plan to spend on improvements, and so on and so forth. So, the budgetary element was pretty important for us.”

They then spent some time checking out the “charming” village on Google Street View, and eventually came across an account of two American soldiers who’d been “helped by the French Resistance in the village during World War II.”

The couple made the decision to purchase the house, which has around 400 square meters of living space, unseen, arranging for an inspector to view it beforehand.

While the property was on the market for around 18,000 euros ($19,400), Ellen and Joseph ended up purchasing it for around 13,000 euros following negotiations with the seller.

“It really wasn’t in move-in condition at all,” says Ellen, explaining that the house would need extensive work to make it liveable again. “The seller kind of agreed with that.”

Once the sale was finalized, they brought in local builders to begin demolition work on the property, overseeing things from their California home.

“They kept us informed. They would send us photographs to show us how the work was progressing,” explains Joseph. “And we would exchange ideas on how the renovation should unfold. So it worked out ok.”

The couple continued to travel to France regularly, flying over in 2015 and 2016 and checking on the progress of the work.

The following year they decided it was finally time to start the process of packing up their lives in the US and moving to France.

The first big step was applying for a long stay visa, which took a few months to finalize, then came what Joseph describes as the “wind down procedure.”

“Prior to your departure, there’s the decision to leave your homeland to go to another country, and all of the implications associated with that decision,” he notes. “All the preparation that has to be done in advance.”

They sold off many of their possessions, keeping only items of sentimental value, and set things in motion so that they could manage their affairs from France.

Big move

They completed extensive renovation work on the home over a period of nearly seven years, replacing the floors and walls, as well as the electrics and plumbing. Ellen and Joseph A.

Ellen and Joseph, who also have a property in New York, decided to rent out their home in California rather than sell it.

They then set about renting an apartment in Paris as their base while work on their Normandy home continued.

“We found that, to be in the parts of Paris that we wanted to live in, it was much less expensive to rent than it would have been to buy,” explains Ellen.

“Plus, the older that you are, the more difficult it is to get a mortgage. We would have had to have sold up and probably bought cash in Paris.”

They arrived in Paris to begin their new lives in April 2017.

Ellen and Joseph quickly set about getting to know their new community, while also traveling back and forth to Lonlay l’Abbaye to check on the renovation work.

“Each year, we budgeted for a different phase of renovation,” says Ellen, before describing how they replaced the floors, walls, electrics, and the plumbing in the home.

“We sought out good building materials and learned about ventilation and humidity issues in old stone houses.”

Ellen goes on to point out that they were able to keep the original staircase inside the house, along with a wooden cabinet that had been in the study.

While they had no choice but to get new windows and doors, they opted to replace them with replicas.

“We like to think that the ghosts of the American GIs who helped to liberate this village would still recognize our house if they walked past it on the street,” she adds.

Their goal was to both transform the tiny house into a liveable second home, and “restore it and leave it in good authentic condition for future generations.”

“We wanted to keep it looking the way it was,” says Ellen. “We didn’t want to make any big changes.”

Renovation project

""We're extremely proud of the builders, who managed to transform this from basically a small country ruin to a very liveable place,"" says Joseph. Ellen and Joseph A.

She points out that any major changes to the outside of our Normandy house had to be approved by the local authorities and the Architectes de Batiments de France, officials concerned with protecting monuments and historic areas, due to the house’s proximity to the village’s 11th century abbey.

But as the work continued to progress, the global pandemic hit, which led to renovations being halted for around two years and they were unable to travel to Normandy to visit.

Thankfully, Ellen and Joseph were able to resume work on the home once restrictions were lifted and had completed the structural work and painting by December 2021. Their new windows were installed a year later.

“We’re extremely proud of the builders, who managed to transform this from basically a small country ruin to a very liveable place,” says Joseph, adding that they’re still working on the furnishing and the “decorative side of” things.

They’d also eventually like to finish off the attic, which is currently used as storage space, and perhaps add a “half bath” up there.

Ellen and Joseph estimate that they spent a total of 65,000 euros (about $70,000) on the building works and labor, and a further 5,000 euros on appliances and furniture.

Now settled in France, they continue to flit back and forth between Paris and Lonlay l’Abbaye, stressing that they wouldn’t have it any other way.

“It’s kind of like a French Brigadoon,” Joseph says of Lonlay l’Abbaye. “There’s a certain magic to the village. The history. The Abbey. And everything is just so close. You’re surrounded by these small hills with trees and grass.

“It’s really a dramatic departure from living in a city like Los Angeles, New York or Paris.”

They’ve formed strong friendships in Lonlay l’Abbaye and travel there by train “every five or six weeks,” staying at their “half house” for a few weeks, before heading back to their rented apartment in Paris.

According to Joseph, the journey between the properties is a little over two and a half hours – their home is a 20-minute taxi ride from Flers station in Normandy.

Both feel that life in France has done wonders for them, explaining that they walk a lot more, and eat much better due to the readily available fresh produce.

“Our daughter thinks that we’ve definitely extended our lifespans by moving here,” says Ellen.

“It just seems like a much healthier lifestyle for us.”

Early on, they decided to “shoulder the responsibility” of learning French to make the transition easier, and stress that this has helped tremendously when it comes to forming bonds.

“Now 90% of all speaking that we do is in French,” says Joseph. “Even though we are far from proficient in French, it’s just something that really, really matters to us. And of course, it makes a difference to other people as well.”

However, the couple admit that they still occasionally find it daunting while attending a dinner with only French speakers who want to discuss philosophy.”

They’ve had to adapt to some of the cultural differences between the French and Americans, and say that some have been easier to get used to than the others.

For instance, Joseph points out that the French are “very, very private” in comparison to Americans, and perhaps less willing to share their lives.

“They don’t invite you to their home right away,” he notes. “They don’t address you in the first person.

“And that’s in contrast to the United States, where people are much more open with each other.”

However, Ellen acknowledges that she’s always been “more comfortable with the French frame of mind” when it comes to relating to people and forming friendships, so this has suited her fine.

“Maybe I’m just a little more introverted,” she notes.

The couple, who chronicled the renovation in an online blog, have found life in France to be more affordable than in the US, noting that their health care costs and property taxes are considerably less now.

In fact, they say the latter is roughly five to six times more on their properties in the States.

“I think that’s one reason why a lot of Americans are thinking of Europe,” says Joseph. “Because of the cost of living, and the property taxes, but also the health care.”

While they both miss living in southern California, neither has any regrets about leaving, admitting that it had become quite draining for them towards the end.

“The traffic. The craziness. And then, to some extent, politically. The divisions in the US were very stressful,” says Ellen.

“It’s not like we were having daily battles with people. But it was hard to watch. It’s still hard to watch the press from overseas and see how divided America is.

“Gee, it doesn’t feel like the America we grew up in anymore.”

They’ve gotten to explore much of France during their time there and have been enjoying learning about the different regions.

“We fully appreciate how much the French enjoy and appreciate the seasons, the moments and the food,” says Ellen. “It’s a different cultural thing, but it’s something you can appreciate.”

They say that they’d advise anyone considering a similar move to research their chosen destination carefully and refrain from trying to “replicate America” wherever they go.

“Leave some of those expectations behind,” says Ellen. “Because you don’t want to just beat your head against a brick wall, and insist on thinking like an American. Saying ‘well, this should be easy, and they should do it this way.’”

They acknowledge that spending so much time in France beforehand made things easier for them, stressing that things may have turned out differently if they had been less familiar with the country.

“We have encountered that with some friends,” says Joseph. “You [can] get some real culture clash.”

Ellen and Joseph currently have no plans to buy a place in Paris and say they’ll continue to move between their apartment in the 7th arrondissement and the countryside, perhaps spending eight months in Paris and four months in Lonlay l’Abbaye in the future.

“It’s kind of an ideal situation where you have a place to get away to. To enjoy everything that Paris has to offer, but then to also get a break from the noise and the business.”

Although they’ve returned to the US to spend time with their family and friends since relocating, they have no intention of returning to the country to live at this point, and can see themselves remaining in France for the rest of their lives.

“There are moments, of course, when we do miss a place, or something from the United States,” says Joseph.

“But this is a way of life. We’re trying to be Americans enjoying France and living here compatibly with the country.

It’s the ‘leaning tower’ that has stood tipsily – but steadily – for nearly 1,000 years. But now, the days of the Garisenda tower in Bologna, Italy, could be numbered. Following investigations last month, the city is instigating a civil protection plan for the “sudden and unexpected collapse of the tower,” which has dominated the Bologna skyline since the 12th century.

A protective metal cordon will be erected to “contain debris resulting from a possible collapse, to reduce the vulnerability of surrounding buildings and the exposure to the population, as well as blocking access to the off-limits area,” the city council said in a statement.

The cordon will be fixed into the ground, and will include specially designed rockfall protection nets, also made of metal and also anchored to the ground.

The warning of a possible collapse was issued in a 27-page report, shared with CNN, by the scientific committee which has monitored the site since 2019.

It puts the site on “high alert” and states that experts “believe that safety conditions no longer exist to operate on or around the tower, except within the framework of a civil protection plan.”

Monitoring of the site over the past month has revealed an “unexpected and accelerated trend” of “crushing” compression to the base of the tower, with gradual disintegration of the stone used to clad the base and cracks expanding in the brick above, it says.

Consolidation works which were already underway have been halted and an exclusion zone is to be built “in the fastest time possible.”

However, the tower isn’t on the verge of immediate collapse, a spokesperson told CNN.

“We’re acting as if it’s the worst case scenario but that’s not to say it’ll happen,” he said, adding that the precautions are currently on “yellow” alert rather than red, where collapse is imminent.

“We’re acting as if it’s about to collapse, but nobody knows when that could be – it could be three months, 10 years, or 20 years.

“If there was an imminent risk of collapse we’d evacuate everyone,” he said, adding that the monitoring equipment delivers readings every 15 minutes, meaning that they should get warning of a collapse, and can evacuate the surrounding area.

One of Bologna’s famous “twin towers” which dominate the city center, the 48-meter (158 feet) Garisenda was built in the 12th century when Bologna was a mini Manhattan, with dozens of towers reaching towards the sky, each built by local families trying to construct theirs higher than the last. Today, few remain. Of those that do, many have had their tops lopped off and been converted into regular houses.

The Garisenda leans at an angle of four degrees – only a little more upright than the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s five degrees. It was already leaning by the early 14th century when Dante wrote “Inferno,” in which he described the dizzy rush of looking up at the Garisenda’s leaning side. Shortened in later years, it sits in the city center beside the Asinelli – a tower twice the height, which tourists could climb until last month.

Bologna’s mayor, Matteo Lepore, ordered the area around the towers to be blocked off in October, although the move to isolate them was for research reasons, rather than safety ones. Acoustic sensors were placed around the Garisenda to monitor cracking and creaking noises, while a pendulum was installed in both towers to track movement and see if regular “oscillation” was going above a certain threshold.

That research has now found not only increased compression in the base of the tower, but that the lean of the tower has started to shift 90 degrees, from an easterly or southeasterly direction to southwards.

The conditions have been steadily declining since July, said a spokesperson for the city council.

‘Inescapably critical condition’

Gradual disintegration of the rock attached to the base, as well as vertical cracks in the bricks that make up the tower, have been noted since 2020 but have now worsened.

The report, which was published on November 15, confirms that the tower has been in an “inescapably critical condition for some time,” and suggests that previous interventions, including a “hoop” of steel rods and cables around the base in 2020, have aggravated the situation.

“The overall situation has unfortunately worsened considerably, with worrying implications for the overall stability of the tower,” reads the report.

“The unexpected and accelerated trend leads the committee to immediately suspend all activities currently underway (especially consolidation) and to put the site on high alert. [The committee believes] that safety conditions no longer exist to operate on or around the tower, except within the framework of a civil protection plan.”

Extreme weather events, including high temperatures this summer and flooding earlier this year, also appear to have played a part, according to the council spokesperson.

Red alert

The cordon will be finished by February. Comune di Bologna

Materials for the protective cordon will be delivered to a site near the tower within the next couple of weeks, with the works due to be completed by February, according to the council.

But anyone who was hoping that the cordon would fit in with the medieval buildings around it will be disappointed by the renderings, which show bright red barriers around the Garisenda. However, it is hopefully only temporary – the report stipulates that any anti-collapse measures must be reversible.

The council spokesperson said that once the cordon has been installed, new research will be undertaken in two phases: first to find a solution to stabilize the tower, and then to resolve the underlying problem.

He said that the first phase might mean creating a metal “cage” for the structure. The second phase is causing more debate.

“Some say let’s dismantle it, redo the base and rebuild it. Others say let’s trim it [the tower itself] as was done in the medieval period. These are all hypotheses that we’re studying – the tower is nearly 1,000 years old and there’s no rulebook,” he said.

The works won’t come cheap – the cordon alone will cost 4.4 million euros (about $4.8 million), and any stabilizing work will cost “millions and millions,” said the spokesperson. The council has set up an online fundraiser with an aim of raising 3 million euros. It has already raised 800,000 euros in a week.

“The twin towers are one of the symbols of the city, along with the [UNESCO-protected] porticoes,” said the spokesperson.

“This isn’t just about saving a heritage site; it also has a very strong symbolic value.”","['leaning', 'protection', 'city', 'collapse', 'garisenda', 'high', 'spokesperson', 'italy', 'alert', 'cordon', 'towers', 'bologna', 'tower', 'base', 'site']","CNN —It’s the ‘leaning tower’ that has stood tipsily – but steadily – for nearly 1,000 years.

251,Harvey Lewis set a backyard ultramarathon record by running 450 miles for four and a half days – while barely sleeping,"CNN —

There came a moment, somewhere on a roadside in rural Tennessee, when Harvey Lewis felt like he could keep running forever.

At this point, he had already been on the move, practically non-stop, for about four days, looping around the same roads, trails, and tracks amongst an ever-shrinking group of runners.

He was battling through feverish sleep deprivation on leaden, depleted legs, and on the front of his sweat-stained vest he wore the splattered evidence of an earlier nosebleed.

But looks can be deceiving, and deep in the corner of his stubborn mind, Lewis knew that he held the golden ticket to winning this backyard ultramarathon race: ensure that every other competitor quits before you.

As the race wore on, he began to feel unstoppable.

“It was like a frequency I found with my rhythm and my pace,” says Lewis, “where I could just maintain that for an incredible amount of time.

“There was some sort of place where my brain took over … and the body finally surrendered to my mind.”

This was at Big’s Backyard Ultra in October, the world championships of backyard ultrarunning.

The discipline of ultrarunning is broadly defined as any distance beyond the 26.2 miles of a marathon, but a backyard ultra has no predetermined length. Runners complete a 4.167-mile loop on the hour, every hour until only one person is left standing. The other competitors are deemed not to have finished, either by dropping out or failing to complete a loop within the cut-off time.

Lewis, a high school teacher and seasoned distance runner from Cincinnati, entered uncharted territory as far as backyard ultras are concerned, completing a scarcely believable 108 loops – the equivalent of 450 miles – over four and a half days at Big’s.

His gargantuan feat of endurance and resilience eventually came to an end when his final competitor, Ihor Verys, failed to complete his 108th loop, becoming what’s known in backyard ultrarunning as “the assist.”

Several weeks later, Lewis is still trying to get his head around his world record – six laps, or 25 miles, more than Australian Phil Gore’s managed at a backyard ultra earlier this year.

“I managed to pull off stretching it to four and a half days,” Lewis tells CNN Sport. “That’s really kind of riveting to me. It sparks my imagination.”

In total, Lewis covered the equivalent of the entire length of Florida, or about the distance from his hometown Cincinnati to Atlanta, stopping only for a few minutes between each loop.

He was midway through his final loop when it suddenly dawned on him that Verys had finally succumbed to the race’s gauntlet of pain, handing Lewis the victory as long as he could haul himself to the cut-off one last time.

“Finishing the final person, you’re on cloud nine,” the 47-year-old Lewis says. “It’s like one of the biggest highs of my life. I couldn’t describe it, especially when it’s such a rigorous, challenging goal.”

There are hundreds of backyard ultras staged around the world each year, but Big’s is the discipline’s original and most famous event.

The concept was devised by Gary Cantrell, the gatekeeper of some of the world’s most punishing foot races, including the fabled Barkley Marathons. Better known as Lazarus Lake, or simply “Laz” to those in the ultrarunning community, Cantrell first staged Big’s around his farm in Bell Buckle in 2011.

The race consists of two different loops: one on trails during the day and another on roads during the night. The start and end of each loop is marked by an overhead structure which reads “there is no finish,” the first three words written by hand and pinned to the banner in crude fashion.

It is there that runners must congregate at the top of the hour, every hour in order to stay in the race.

“It’s a tribute to a human’s ability to just continually push that boundary of what’s possible further and further out,” Cantrell says in a video promoting the event.

Lewis, now a two-time winner and three-time assist, is a dedicated disciple of Big’s. He credits success in this year’s race to a combination of careful preparation, his previous experience on the course and at many other ultramarathons, and sheer force of will in the closing stages.

“I always believed that I was going to still be the final person, and I never lost the vision of that,” says Lewis.

His training for this year’s race was at times peculiar, especially when it came to managing sleep deprivation. During his lunchtime breaks at school, Lewis would roll out a yoga mat in a storage closet and try to fall asleep for three to five minutes as quickly as possible, simulating the short breaks he would get between loops at Big’s.

Other times, he says that he would run to the park and lie down on the grass for several minutes.

Come the race itself, Lewis’ sleep strategy hardly went to plan. Unable to quiet his mind the night before, he only slept for three hours and then didn’t sleep at all for the first three days of the race. After that, he was able to switch off for one or two minutes between loops.

Thankfully, he wasn’t derailed by the same “incredibly intense hallucinations” that plagued him during a backyard ultra in Australia earlier in the year.

“I actually saw these grass people and the trees came alive,” Lewis recalls. “I would fall asleep for just a second, my sense of sound was super accented. It was like that show ‘Stranger Things.’”

His strategy if he gets similar hallucinations in another race? “I feel like I would be able to, like, just run through that,” Lewis adds. “It would maybe make it very interesting.”

That’s not to say that his sanity remained entirely intact at Big’s: on the fourth day, he started to talk gibberish to the other competitors.

“I was semi-conscious, semi-dreaming, and I would just start to say random things,” says Lewis. “I had to censor myself and not just say whatever I was thinking in my dreamlike running state.”

He estimates that he consumed more than 40,000 calories during the race, all of which was plant-based – something Lewis says helped to settle his stomach when eating on the move.

His race diet was varied and plentiful: avocado and hummus wraps, lentil soup, peanut noodles, vegan mac and cheese, vegan yoghurt, cupcakes, and different fruits – blueberries, mangoes, watermelon – were all on the menu.

He also never drank water on the course, instead opting for fluids with calories like coconut water, Coke, or electrolyte drinks.

“I was always grazing on foods,” says Lewis, “enjoying my appetite and enjoying the smorgasbord.”

An upset stomach is one of myriad challenges a runner might face at Big’s. Another is the risk of a fall – particularly on the roots, rocks, and foliage found on the day-time loop around Cantrell’s farm – while rattlesnakes and copperheads can also make for alarming bystanders on the trails.

Lewis fell just once, evidenced by the reddish marks that appeared on the side of his head towards the end of the race. “I’m pretty good at falling,” he explains. “I’ve fallen a lot in my lifetime.”

How a runner responds to adversity can be crucial at determining how long they survive at Big’s. Lewis figures that the effort required in the race is about 70% mental and 30% physical, and he has developed unique ways of hardening his mind during backyard ultras.

“I have spirit animals that I like to embody in the race,” says Lewis. “With Big’s, I was saying that my spirit animal was the honey badger. The honey badger can be knocked down, beaten, bitten, cut – everything happening to it and the honey badger just keeps on going.”

The honey badger analogy can also be extended to Lewis’ ultrarunning career as a whole, his progress in the sport gutsy and gradual. He says that he achieved the qualification time for the Boston Marathon after 17 years of trying and won an ultramarathon 13 years after competing in his first.

He describes himself as a “chubby” kid growing up – quite the contrast to the man who these days runs to and from work, adding extra distance as he builds up to a race.

“It was an ultra to get to where I am today,” says Lewis.

He was running Big’s to raise money for the Brighton Center, an organization in Northern Kentucky which helps individuals and families to achieve financial stability and independence, and also wants to inspire people to invest more in their personal health – even if that means getting outdoors for 20 or 30 minutes each day.

And in terms of his personal goals, Lewis has started to reflect on what it might be possible to achieve in the backyard ultra format.

“If the opportunity comes again: how will I be able to go through that fifth night?” he muses. “How will I come out on that sixth day, and then will we get back to another night?”

Four and a half days and 450 miles might just be the start for Harvey Lewis. This is, after all, a race with no finish line.","['record', 'lewis', 'days', 'ultramarathon', 'sleep', 'minutes', 'loop', 'set', 'harvey', 'backyard', 'sleeping', 'running', 'ultrarunning', 'race', 'half', 'miles', 'ultra', 'bigs']","“There was some sort of place where my brain took over … and the body finally surrendered to my mind.”This was at Big’s Backyard Ultra in October, the world championships of backyard ultrarunning.

252,"UK government signs Hillsborough Charter, acknowledges ‘multiple injustices’ suffered by soccer stadium disaster victims","CNN —

The UK government has signed the Hillsborough Charter, acknowledging “multiple injustices” and vowing that no families will suffer the same fates as the relatives of the victims from the infamous soccer ground tragedy.

Ninety-seven Liverpool supporters died as a result of the April 1989 disaster at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, England.

“The Charter, which the Government has signed, seeks to ensure that the lessons of the Hillsborough disaster and its aftermath are learned, to prevent those who are affected by public tragedy in the future from having the same experience,” UK Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said in a statement on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons: “The Hillsborough families have suffered multiple injustices and, more than 34 years later, there can never be too many apologies for what they have been through.

“And I want to repeat that apology today, and thank the Hillsborough families for their tenacity, patience and courage.”

The government was responding to a 2017 report, published by former Liverpool Bishop James Jones, which consulted the families on lessons from the stadium disaster and made 25 recommendations which could help shape the response to future disasters.

Among those recommendations was a call for the creation of a special charter that would see public bodies act transparently and in the public interest.

The government’s charter also promises to implement a “duty of candour” for policing in England and Wales, which aims to promote a culture of honesty and transparency during investigations and inquiries.

In January, England and Wales police chiefs apologized for having “profoundly failed” those bereaved by the stadium disaster and promised “widespread” policing reforms.

On top of the 97 people killed as a result of the disaster, another 162 were hospitalized with injuries. According to the BBC, it was the worst sports disaster in British history.","['disaster', 'signs', 'signed', 'multiple', 'victims', 'suffered', 'wales', 'charter', 'families', 'stadium', 'uk', 'hillsborough', 'result', 'soccer', 'public', 'injustices']","CNN —The UK government has signed the Hillsborough Charter, acknowledging “multiple injustices” and vowing that no families will suffer the same fates as the relatives of the victims from the infamous soccer ground tragedy.

253,"The Hughes brothers had a historic night on the ice, playing in the same game for the first time as New Jersey Devils win","CNN —

The Hughes family had quite a night on the ice as brothers Jack and Luke faced off against sibling Quinn as the New Jersey Devils defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6-5 at Rogers Arena on Tuesday.

It was the first time that the trio had all played in the same NHL game, and only the ninth time in NHL history that three brothers had taken to the ice at the same time.

According to the NHL, it was the second time an American family had three brothers play in the same game, and the first since 1990 when Neal and Aaron Broten of the Minnesota North Stars played against their brother Paul and the New York Rangers.

The trio, whose parents were in attendance at Rogers Arena, were able to take a historic photo together at center ice before the game.

“Getting a picture in warm-ups was really good,” said the 20-year-old Luke. “Haven’t really let it sink in yet. Just seeing [Quinn] off ice. I hadn’t seen him for a couple of months.”

The 24-year-old Quinn had two assists for the Canucks, giving him 36 points for the season, the most in the league for a defenseman. Luke and the 22-year-old Jack both scored for the Devils. Jack also picked up two assists.

“Of course you dream you’re going to play with your brothers in the NHL one day,” Jack told the NHL website before the game. “You’re in the basement, hanging out, playing, but you never really think it’s going to become a reality. For it to happen, it’s definitely pretty wild. It’s three kids in one game.

If much of the focus was on the Hughes siblings, Jesper Bratt’s contribution proved key with goals from the Swedish winger bookending the scoring, with a late one-timer off a rebound with 34 seconds left sealing the victory for New Jersey.

The Devils raced into a 5-2 lead through the first two periods but the Canucks came back into the game in the third as goals by Brock Boeser, Sam Lafferty and Nils Hoglander tied things up before Bratt’s last-minute winner.

“Pretty good in the first two [periods] and then pretty ugly in the third,” said Jack, summing up his team’s performance after the game. “But we found a way to win so that’s all that matters.”

“It’s tough now,” Quinn said when asked if he could appreciate playing against his brothers. “I’m sure they’re appreciating it more than I am right now, but it’s very cool. Looking back the next couple of days or months, it’d be a cool one.”

The Hughes brothers are no strangers to making history. Quinn was drafted seventh overall in 2018, Jack went first overall in 2019 and Luke came off the board at fourth overall in 2021, meaning that each brother was selected inside the top seven in an unprecedented feat.

Jack entered Tuesday’s game leading the league in points per game with 1.76, while Quinn came in at fourth overall in league scoring, per the Devils.

“They’ve put their name on notice throughout the League,” said Devils winger Tyler Toffoli ahead of Tuesday’s game. “The three of them are all extremely good players.

With Quinn and Jack being completely established and superstars already and Luke not far behind them.”

Though this was the first time that all three siblings had taken part in the same game, it was the seventh time that Quinn and Jack had faced off. Jack has frequently gotten the better of the matchup, with the Devils having a 6-1-0 record in these clashes.","['hughes', 'luke', 'night', 'nhl', 'quinn', 'overall', 'jersey', 'game', 'ice', 'jack', 'devils', 'league', 'win', 'brothers', 'historic', 'playing']","CNN —The Hughes family had quite a night on the ice as brothers Jack and Luke faced off against sibling Quinn as the New Jersey Devils defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6-5 at Rogers Arena on Tuesday.

254,Copa América 2024: CONMEBOL announces 14 host cities as tournament returns to the US,"CNN —

CONMEBOL, South America’s soccer federation, has announced the 14 cities that will host matches at the 2024 Copa América as the tournament returns to the United States for the first time since 2016.

The 14 cities are Las Vegas (NV), Arlington (TX), Charlotte (NC), Orlando (FL), Miami Gardens (FL), Santa Clara (CA), Atlanta (GA), East Rutherford (NJ), Houston (TX), Austin (TX), Inglewood (CA), Glendale (AZ), Kansas City (KS) and Kansas City (MO).

The tournament opener will be played at Atlanta United’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium, with the final taking place at Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium.

It will be only the second time, after the special centenary Copa América in 2016, that the tournament has been hosted outside of South America.

Ecuador was originally designated as the tournament host but pulled out in November 2022 due to economic and security concerns, as well as a lack of viable stadiums.

That reportedly left just the US and Peru as the two nations willing to host the 2024 edition, with CONMEBOL and CONCACAF – the federation for North America, Central America and the Caribbean – jointly choosing the US in January of this year.

Though the US unquestionably has better stadium infrastructure than any South American nation, the decision to once again host the tournament stateside led to some criticism in Latin America.

“South America is having a hard time organizing its historic national team tournament,” Ezequiel Fernández Moores wrote in Argentine outlet La Nación in February.

CONMEBOL has encountered obstacles in hosting the last three editions of the Copa América held in South America. In 2015, the host nation was changed from Brazil to Chile due to the former already hosting the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.

Colombia was set to co-host the 2020 edition with Argentina, before it was postponed by a year due to the Covid pandemic. Protests across the country the following year led to Colombia withdrawing as co-host, with Argentina following suit soon after as the country grappled with high Covid cases.

The tournament was eventually moved to Brazil and played behind closed doors.

Now, for the third edition in a row, the host nation has been changed after the US took over organizing duties from Ecuador.

However, Fernández Moores questioned why the same scrutiny, particularly around safety, isn’t applied to the United States.

“It doesn’t matter that games can be played in California, the State that has just suffered four mass shootings in just 10 days in January,” Fernández Moores wrote.

“For the third year in a row, the United States suffered more than six hundred mass shootings in 2022. In the first three weeks of 2023, there have already been 39 shootings.

“It is unthinkable that CONMEBOL for its 2024 Copa América or FIFA for its 2026 World Cup would demand that the United States review its festival of naturalized violence, which kills in shopping malls, schools or on any street.”

But hosting the 2024 Copa América is undoubtedly a huge boost for the USA as the country gears up to jointly host the 2026 World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico.

In a country where soccer is still sometimes played in the shadows of the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL, a successful tournament for the US Men’s National Team could play a huge role in boosting national interest ahead of 2026.

The 2016 edition was an overwhelming success, too, registering a record average attendance of 46,000 and becoming the most lucrative Copa América to date, according to La Nación.

Coupled with Lionel Messi’s arrival at Inter Miami, which has garnered worldwide attention and caused spikes in ticket sales and attendances, the 2024 Copa América could prove to be a perfect warm-up of sorts for both organizers and fans alike.

Messi’s matches for Inter Miami have drawn star-studded crowds, while tickets – for both home and away games – are in huge demand, although the club has received criticism for hiking season ticket prices for next year and pricing out fans who had been loyal to the team prior to Messi’s arrival.

It’s unclear whether Messi’s stateside adventure will boost soccer’s popularity in the US long-term, but perhaps few people will care as long as there is plenty of money to be made while he’s still in Miami.

But the Argentine’s arrival hasn’t just boosted the coffers. His utterly dominant performances on the pitch – which have at times looked laughably easy – led Inter Miami to its first title in the club’s five-year history by helping the team win the Leagues Cup just months after joining.

Such has been his influence in 2023 after guiding Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of 2022, Messi was named TIME’s Athlete of the Year on Tuesday.

“At 36, two decades into his unparalleled career, Messi provided a singular stimulus to soccer in America. Attendance, ticket prices, merchandise sales, and viewership soared. His games took on the feel of a religious revival,” Sean Gregory wrote in TIME.

“With the US hosting three major international tournaments in the next three years (Copa América in 2024, the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025, and the grandest of them all, the World Cup, in 2026), it’s sure to attract even more fans. But Messi is an accelerant.

“With the most revered and influential athlete on the planet playing in Miami for at least the next two years, still performing at the top of his game – he won another Ballon d’Or as the world’s player of the year, his eighth, in late October – the US is now a soccer nation. A fútbol nation.”","['host', 'cities', '14', 'copa', 'tournament', 'america', 'nation', 'américa', 'world', 'announces', '2024', 'cup', 'returns', 'conmebol', 'miami']","CNN —CONMEBOL, South America’s soccer federation, has announced the 14 cities that will host matches at the 2024 Copa América as the tournament returns to the United States for the first time since 2016.

255,Aaron Rodgers criticizes ‘character assassination’ of Jets teammate Zach Wilson,"CNN —

New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has criticized what he calls the “character assassination” of his teammate, Zach Wilson, in the media following reports that the former No. 2 overall pick was reluctant to retake the starting position after being benched earlier in the season.

According to the report from The Athletic, citing multiple team sources, the Jets want Wilson to return as the team’s starting quarterback for their Week 14 game against the Houston Texans after experimenting with Tim Boyle and Trevor Siemian in the position, but the third-year signal-caller was hesitant to do so “due to perceived injury risk.”

Rodgers, who suffered a torn Achilles just four snaps into his stint in New Jersey, said that he believed the report was “chickensh*t at its core,” adding that he “loves” Wilson.

“First of all, you can go down a whole rabbit hole with actual sources, made up sources, why is someone willing to be a source?” Rodgers said during his weekly appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” on Tuesday. “What are they gaining out of that?

“On and on and on, but when you use sources and, whether intentional or unintentional, try to assassinate someone’s character like that report does for Zach, I have a real hard time with that.”

The 40-year-old continued: “How can you read it any other way? You’re basically saying this kid is quitting on the team and doesn’t want to play and is giving the middle finger to the organization.

“I don’t want to speak for him. He’s going to get a chance this week to speak and I’m going to let him speak. … (But) he’s gone through a lot of sh*t in the last three years and he’s got every right to be frustrated and disappointed about it.”

CNN has reached out to Wilson to offer him the right of reply to the report. Wilson has not publicly responded to The Athletic’s reporting and is scheduled to speak to the media on Thursday.

Earlier this week, Jets head coach Robert Saleh was non-committal when asked about who would start at quarterback for his team’s Week 14 game against the Houston Texans on Sunday, though he denied reports that Wilson is reluctant to retake the starting position.

“Let’s be clear, if [Wilson] was reluctant to play, he wouldn’t be here,” said Saleh on Monday. “I actually coincidentally just got done speaking with him. He came in about a half hour ago and we had a really good conversation.

“The young man wants the ball. He wants to start. He believes he’s the best quarterback in the room and the best quarterback for this team and the guy who gives us the best chance to win,” added Saleh.

“We’re in a society now where kids miss bowl games because they’re worried about their draft status, right?” said Saleh. “So empathetically, if that discussion had been had somewhere, and again it wasn’t with me, but if that conversation was had and it somehow leaked out to the media, I don’t think that’s indicative of his mindset. The kid wants to play.”

The Athletic story quoted anonymous sources talking about Wilson’s reluctance to return as the Jets’ starter.

Four-time NFL MVP Rodgers expressed his displeasure of the culture of anonymous leaks from within the Jets organization.

“We need to get to the bottom of whatever this is coming from and put a stop to it, privately, because there’s no place in a winning culture where – and this isn’t the only time; there’s been a bunch of other leaks.”

Rodgers added: “Some conversations are only meant for certain people and shouldn’t leave the building.

“There’s a trust that goes along with being in the locker room, where you say something to your homie and that sh*t doesn’t go anywhere. Or you say something in the team meeting room [and it] doesn’t go anywhere. There’s been too many instances this season where stuff is happening. It’s not OK, and we need to weed it out in whatever way necessary.”

CNN has offered the Jets a right of reply regarding Rodgers’ comments about anonymous leaks from within the organization.

Seeking their first postseason berth since 2010, the Jets – who waived Boyle on Tuesday and signed Brett Rypien from the Seattle Seahawks’ practice squad – were given a glimmer of hope last week when Rodgers was cleared to practice, despite the initial expectation that he would be out for the remainder of the season.

However, it is still unclear when he will be able to play, if at all, this season.","['sources', 'speak', 'quarterback', 'assassination', 'right', 'team', 'character', 'aaron', 'week', 'teammate', 'wilson', 'jets', 'report', 'rodgers', 'zach', 'criticizes']","CNN —New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has criticized what he calls the “character assassination” of his teammate, Zach Wilson, in the media following reports that the former No.

256,"Rembrandt painting once valued at $15,000 sells for almost $14 million at Sotheby’s auction","Editor’s Note: This article was updated with the final sale price and other details following the auction’s conclusion.

London CNN —

A painting valued at $15,000 just two years ago fetched almost £11 million ($13.8 million) at a Sotheby’s auction on Wednesday after being identified as the work of the Dutch master Rembrandt.

“Adoration of the Kings” had been virtually unseen since the 1950s, when it first came to light. It was acquired by collector J.C.H. Heldring in Amsterdam in 1955. His widow sold it to a German family in 1985, where it remained until it was sold by Christie’s in Amsterdam two years ago.

At the time of that sale, Christie’s attributed the biblical scene to the “Circle of Rembrandt,” suggesting it had been carried out by a student or an artist close to the famous painter, and estimated its value at between €10,000 and €15,000 (then around $10,600 to $15,900).

Extensive tests revealed changes that Rembrandt had made to the painting. Sotheby's

The monochromatic painting, which measures 9.6 x 7.3 inches, was purchased by an anonymous buyer for €860,000 (then around $910,000) at the Christie’s sale — more than 50 times the painting’s estimated value at the time. It was later identified as “a work of great significance” by the Dutch painter, according to a Sotheby’s press release published prior to Wednesday’s sale.

After the anonymous buyer consigned it to Sotheby’s, the auction house embarked on an 18-month research project to arrive at the painting’s true attribution and value.

The examination, which involved X-rays and infrared imaging, as well as intensive discussions with leading Rembrandt scholars, led Sotheby’s to conclude the painting is “an autograph work by Rembrandt.” Prior to the sale, the auction house gave the work an estimated value of £10 million to £15 million ($12.6 million to $18.8 million).

The auction house believes it was painted early in Rembrandt’s career, around 1628, when he would have been aged 21 or 22 and living in the Dutch city of Leiden.

A rare find

The vast majority of Rembrandt’s works hang in museums around the world, and almost all of those that have come to auction over the past three decades “have been portraits or studies of single character heads,” according to the Sotheby’s release.

As such, “Adoration of the Kings,” which depicts the encounter between the Three Wise Men and the baby Jesus, represented a “fantastic opportunity” in the art world, George Gordon, co-chairman of Old Master Paintings Worldwide at Sotheby’s, told CNN prior to the sale.

In a phone call with CNN, he said: “I would say that it’s particularly significant because it adds to our understanding of Rembrandt at this crucial date in his development and career, when he was clearly very ambitious and developing very quickly as an artist.”

The earliest reference to the painting appears to be from the 1714 inventory of a collector in Amsterdam, Constantijn Ranst. It was then offered for sale in 1814 and again in 1822, after which it disappeared from view until the mid-20th century.

It was included in museum exhibitions and referenced as a Rembrandt work by leading Rembrandt scholars in the 1950s, but in 1960 German art historian Kurt Bauch, who only knew the painting from a black and white photograph, described it as a product of the Rembrandt School and omitted it from from the catalogue raisonné he was compiling. Thereafter, the painting was “entirely overlooked and completely ignored in the Rembrandt literature,” according to Sothebys.

Gordon told CNN that those bidding at the Christie’s auction in 2021 “must have thought it was much better than the description and that it might well be a Rembrandt.”

Sotheby’s close examination revealed a number of changes and revisions that Rembrandt made, including to the baby Jesus’ halo and the Virgin Mary’s headdress, according to the auction house.

“Very few narrative paintings by Rembrandt remain in private hands, making this an opportunity for a private collector or an institution that is as rare as it is exciting,” Gordon had said in the news release.

“This sophisticated painting is in equal measure a product of Rembrandt’s brush and his intellect. All the hallmarks of his style in the late 1620s are evident both in the visible painted surface and in the underlying layers revealed by science, showing multiple changes in the course of its creation, and casting fresh light on how he thought,” he added.","['14', 'valued', 'paintings', 'sothebys', 'million', 'auction', 'rembrandt', '15000', 'cnn', 'christies', 'painting', 'work', 'sale', 'sells']","London CNN —A painting valued at $15,000 just two years ago fetched almost £11 million ($13.8 million) at a Sotheby’s auction on Wednesday after being identified as the work of the Dutch master Rembrandt.

258,Florence Nightingale: ‘Final’ photos of nursing pioneer up for auction,"London CNN —

Photos thought to be among the last taken of Florence Nightingale are among a number of items related to the famed English nurse going up for auction in London.

The small, sepia images were taken by Eliza Francis “Fanny” Pettit, who was Nightingale’s companion late in her life, and show the nurse sitting in an armchair, according to auction house Roseberys.

A photo from the sale shows Nightingale sitting in an armchair. from Roseberys London

They measure just 5.9 x 5.9 centimeters (2.3 x 2.3 inches) and were taken around 1910. Nightingale died on August 13 of that year, at age 90.

“The family history behind these photographs leads us to believe that they may be the final images taken of Nightingale,” Jack Wallis, a works of art specialist at Roseberys, told CNN.

“We can be certain that they were taken in 1910, and as such almost certainly in the final weeks or months of Nightingale’s life,” he said. The photos were exclusively exhibited at the Florence Nightingale Museum in London, confirming their authenticity, Wallis added.

“What makes them so special is their personal, candid nature - they are informal shots captured for posterity by a close friend to remember a much-loved principal,” he said.

Born in 1820, Nightingale was an English nurse who became the first woman to receive the Order of Merit, for her efforts treating wounded soldiers during the 1853-1856 Crimean War. She became famous as the “Lady with the Lamp” because of her reputation for making rounds at night to check on the patients.

Nightingale went on to play a key role in formalizing education for nurses, setting up the Nightingale School of Nursing at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London in 1860.

International Nurses Day is celebrated every year on May 12, Nightingale’s birthday, in her honor.

Other items in Thursday’s sale include a travel teapot and silver-plated tea caddy, given to Pettit by Nightingale, as well as a letter written by housekeeper Elizabeth Bosanquet detailing the last hours of Nightingale’s life.

In the letter, Bosanquet invited Pettit to visit “to look on Miss Nightingale’s peaceful face.”

“She passed away quietly at 2pm yesterday resting on her pillows just as she had been placed the night before,” it reads, according to Roseberys.

“It was very peaceful and merciful and one is so thankful she slept away with no suffering,” Bosanquet wrote. “We shall all be the better for her wonderful influence.”

Wallis said that “it is very rare for a collection of this nature to come to market, particularly in relation to an icon of British history such as Florence Nightingale.”

“The collection really paints a picture of Nightingale’s character and the last days of her life,” he said.

It is expected to fetch £15,000-25,000 ($19,000-31,000) at auction.","['pioneer', 'florence', 'taken', 'london', 'life', 'auction', 'nurse', 'nursing', 'photos', 'nightingales', 'final', 'pettit', 'bosanquet', 'nightingale']","London CNN —Photos thought to be among the last taken of Florence Nightingale are among a number of items related to the famed English nurse going up for auction in London.

259,Opinion: US must send tougher message to Iran’s proxies in the Middle East,"Editor’s note: Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.

CNN —

US military forces once again confronted aggressive, potentially deadly moves by Iran-allied militias in the Middle East over the weekend. It’s further evidence that American efforts to deter these militias’ dangerous, persistent belligerence are simply not working. The message to Iran is not getting through.

Frida Ghitis CNN

On Sunday, explosions rocked the Red Sea¸ the narrow but pivotal body of water that connects Europe to the Middle East and Asia. Yemen’s Houthi militias, closely allied with Iran, were firing missiles at commercial vessels and possibly at US naval ships, so the United States fired back, shooting down drones, repeating a now familiar but increasingly perilous cycle that threatens to escalate with potentially ominous consequences.

The USS Carney responded amid a series of four attacks by the Houthis, according to US Central Command. Most of the militia’s targets were civilian cargo ships, but, worryingly, at least one armed drone was “headed toward Carney although its specific target is not clear,” the US statement said.

The continuing attacks by militias allied with Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, targeting US forces across the Middle East along with civilian vessels, are posing an untenable dilemma for the Biden administration.

The White House wisely wants to prevent the war between Israel and Hamas — like the Houthis a member of Iran’s “axis of resistance” — from expanding into a regional conflict. But Iran’s proxies are relentlessly taunting the Americans. Iran’s partners have launched at least 76 separate attacks against US forces in Syria and Iraq since mid-October, a defense official told CNN. They attack American targets almost daily.

The Biden administration is trying to modulate its response, hitting back hard enough to deter Iran with multiple strikes against a variety of targets — killing Iran-backed militia members in Iraq this weekend, striking IRGC weapons depots in Syria, warning Hezbollah in Lebanon to think twice before jumping in — but not so hard that it falls into the trap of getting involved in another war, which neither President Joe Biden nor any responsible person in America wants.

Iran knows that.

Some Republicans are critical of the Biden administration for not doing more to prevent the attacks by the Houthis and other Iran proxies. Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, a Democrat, recently urged a more aggressive approach as well.

As Israel and Hamas battle each other, Iran is showcasing its defiance, trying to flex its muscle, highlighting its geographic reach across several Mideast countries, perhaps seeking to intimidate other regional rivals, along with Israel and even the United States. By keeping its own uniformed fighters largely out of the fray, Tehran has plausible deniability about its involvement in the attacks.

Few are fooled. Central Command’s statement on Sunday declared that the US believes the Houthi attacks “are fully enabled by Iran.”

For the Houthis, these violent expressions of solidarity with Hamas constitute an opportunity to burnish their standing among the Arab and Muslim publics, who are siding strongly with the Palestinians.

Whatever the motivation, the continuing attacks, and the escalating threats to civil navigation cannot be allowed to stand.

One of the most urgent items on the agenda is stabilizing conditions on the Red Sea. Look at a map. The Red Sea is the channel that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the rest of the Middle East and Asia. Any commerce between China, India or other Asian countries with Europe or the US East Coast has to pass through the Suez Canal that links the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The Houthis pose a grave threat to international commerce and the global economy, not to mention regional stability.

The US and NATO should assertively defend freedom of navigation. The Houthis, an Iran-armed organization, needs to be confronted before a disaster at sea sends shockwaves of disruption across the global economy.

In the first place, Houthis must be designated as a terrorist organization once again.

Last month, the Biden administration revealed that it is reviewing “potential terrorist designations” for the Shia extremist group. Already members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, are urging the administration to do just that.

The move would confirm the shift in the administration’s geopolitical stance and the waning influence on Biden’s foreign policy by progressive forces within the Democratic Party.

In February 2021, just a month after Biden’s inauguration, one of the first acts of Secretary of State Antony Blinken was lifting the Houthis’ designation as a terrorist group.

The decision was remarkable because the State Department’s announcement confirmed that the Houthis are, in fact, terrorists, noting that the group formally known as Ansarallah, was “kidnapping and torturing citizens of the United States and many of our allies, diverting humanitarian aid, brutally repressing Yemenis.”

Still, the war between the Houthi rebels and the government they sought to unseat in Yemen, backed by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia, had become a major humanitarian catastrophe. Progressive figures argued that lifting the terrorist designation — regardless of its accuracy — would save lives.

In those days, the Biden administration was trying to cool relations with Saudi Arabia, a plan that later also went into reverse.

That the Houthis are terrorists is beyond dispute. They have imprisoned and tortured countless Yemenites and foreigners. Human rights organizations have thoroughly documented their violations. They have crushed women’s rights, imprisoning and torturing women, prompting critics to suggest Yemen is headed in Afghanistan’s Taliban direction. They’ve gone after journalists, sentencing them to death before subjecting them to torture, and routinely abusing other civilians while blocking humanitarian assistance from reaching them.

Their insurgency rose out of the remote Saada governorate of Yemen, where the ethnic Houthis practice Zaidi Shia Islam. The Houthis accused the government of then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh of corruption and of being too close to Saudi Arabia and the United States.

Supported, armed and trained by Iran, they adopted the very revealing anti-American and antisemitic slogan, “God is greatest (Allahu Akbar), death to America, death to Israel, cursed be the Jews, victory to Islam.”

The Houthis say their attacks will continue until Israel stops its campaign in Gaza. But, like Hamas, Iran, Hezbollah and other members of the so-called axis of resistance, they oppose any permanent reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians and support Israel’s destruction.

Since the October 7 Hamas massacre of Israelis that triggered the current war, the Houthis have seized a Japan-chartered cargo ship, and they have targeted a UK-owned and operated vessel, among others. They also fired ballistic missiles toward the USS Mason as the American Navy ship responded to a distress call from another civilian ship under attack.

In addition, the Houthis have launched guided missiles toward Israeli cities. American and Israeli defensive weapons have shot those down, but these moves raise the troubling question of what would ensue if a Yemeni missile hit an Israeli city.

Formally designating the Houthis a terrorist organization would provide moral clarity and prevent the Houthis from using US financial institutions and other facilities, and it would be unlikely to have negative humanitarian repercussions.

The brutal civil war that plunged Yemen’s civilians into a catastrophe is winding down after a 2022 ceasefire. Like other Iran-linked militias, the Houthis remain a source of instability, propelled by an uncompromising and repressive ideology.

Their actions, and those of other militias that are repeatedly attacking US forces require a more forceful response. The United States needs to continue calibrating its pushback carefully, but the current level is not sending the necessary message that the attacks must stop.","['sea', 'terrorist', 'tougher', 'opinion', 'attacks', 'militias', 'middle', 'east', 'united', 'biden', 'send', 'war', 'irans', 'iran', 'message', 'houthis', 'red', 'proxies']","Frida Ghitis CNNOn Sunday, explosions rocked the Red Sea¸ the narrow but pivotal body of water that connects Europe to the Middle East and Asia.

260,Opinion: What do you expect when an oil executive runs the climate talks?,"Editor’s Note: John D. Sutter is a climate journalist and nonfiction filmmaker. He is the Ted Turner Visiting Professor of Environmental Media at the George Washington University. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

As someone who’s been reporting on the climate crisis for more than a decade, I can say that the most insidious threat to climate action isn’t denial or apathy.

John D. Sutter Beth Mickalonis

It’s doubt and confusion.

That’s why the news from COP28 in Dubai is so infuriating.

The COP — an international peer-pressure meeting meant to avert disastrous global warming — is supposed to be a moment of resounding clarity, when world leaders come together to re-up their commitments to abandon fossil fuels and promote a future that’s, you know, livable.

The message should be clear: The world can and should abandon fossil fuels as quickly as possible in favor of cleaner energy sources like wind and solar.

We have the technology and the political levers we need to succeed.

Instead, the COP28 talks have been mired in controversy and confusion.

The United Arab Emirates, a petrostate, is hosting the talks. The COP president is Sultan Al Jaber, the head of a renewable energy company and also the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.

Appointing an oil exec to run global climate negotiations is not unlike letting the NRA facilitate a symposium on gun control.

No surprise, then, that Al Jaber made some, well, stupefying comments, including that abandoning fossil fuels — which, again, should be the point of these talks — risks putting us “back into caves.” He also claimed, falsely, that there is “no science” supporting a total phase-out of fossil fuels in order to meet temperature goals that are the center of the negotiations.

“Please, help me, show me a roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuels that will allow for sustainable socio-economic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves,” he said on November 21, in the days leading up to the COP28 summit. The remarks were part of a conversation with Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and UN special climate envoy, and were first reported by The Guardian, which posted a video of the discussion.

“There is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5C,” he said, referencing a temperature target from the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

A report issued Sunday during COP28 by the UN Environment Programme and others states that “a rapid and managed fossil fuel phase-out is required” to meet global climate goals.

Al Jaber tried to walk back the comments at a press conference on Monday, saying that he respects science and that the comments were subject to “misrepresentation.” “I have said over and over that the phase-down and the phase-out of fossil fuels is inevitable,” he said.

By then, however, the damage had been done.

Observers are right to question Al Jaber’s intentions and the intent of this entire process. And the public could understandably be confused about whether these efforts are even worthwhile.

That’s tragic, especially in light of the long and frustrating history of fossil fuel interests injecting doubt into policy conversations about the climate crisis. The broad strokes of climate science have been well understood for several decades now.

Starting in the 1970s, fossil fuel companies took a page from the tobacco industry’s playbook and started injecting doubt and confusion into well-settled science. John D. Sutter

But starting in the 1970s, fossil fuel companies took a page from the tobacco industry’s playbook and started injecting doubt and confusion into well-settled science. The fallout of that doubt still haunts political conversations about the climate crisis today. It leads to years and decades of stalled or flimsy action.

It’s also frustrating given that the public has few opportunities to focus on global warming — and the annual COP meeting tends to be one such moment when the world pays attention.

In the United States, only 35% of adults talk about the climate crisis at least occasionally, according to a 2021 survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

Slightly less — 33% — hear about it at least once a week in the media.

Not quite what you’d expect given that the habitability of our planet is in jeopardy. We are living with the consequences of a world we’ve warmed today — in the form of wildfires, extreme weather, searing drought and a burgeoning extinction crisis in the natural world.

If there’s a silver lining to the fact that Al Jaber’s comments have been wildly distracting, and disruptive, it’s that there is some benefit to plainly observing the predicament we are in.

Heat-trapping pollution from fossil fuels continues to go up year after year.

There are plenty of people and companies who profit from it.

Perhaps calling for Al Jaber to resign is part of a short-term solution to restore the credibility of COP28 and all the COP meetings still to come. But there’s a bigger point on which there must be absolute clarity in the public mind: We must demand a total phase-out of fossil fuels.

World leaders at COP28 can and should deliver on that promise.

And the public must hold them to account.","['expect', 'runs', 'climate', 'opinion', 'oil', 'fuels', 'phaseout', 'executive', 'science', 'world', 'fossil', 'cop28', 'talks', 'fuel', 'doubt', 'crisis']","CNN —As someone who’s been reporting on the climate crisis for more than a decade, I can say that the most insidious threat to climate action isn’t denial or apathy.

CNN —

Arguments are raging over whether Israel is adequately protecting civilian life in a war that has killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health and whether the world has adequately responded to a brutal terrorist attack in which Hamas, according to Israeli officials, killed more than 1,400 Israelis, raped women and kidnapped civilians.

Jill Filipovic Courtesy Jill Filipovic

Perhaps the last thing we need right now is that we’re grappling with controversy over what celebrities should or shouldn’t say, and how they should apologize when they inevitably botch commentary over complex world events.

Julianna Margulies, for example, has apologized for offensive comments she made on a podcast last month, in which she said she was disappointed that the Black and LGBTQ communities hadn’t come out in full-throated support of Jews in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks and the ongoing war in Gaza. “The fact that the entire Black community isn’t standing with us, to me, says either they just don’t know or they’ve been brainwashed to hate Jews,” she said.

She also said that, as an actress who played a lesbian on TV, she was offended by pro-Palestinian LGBTQ activists who “have no idea that if they stepped foot in an Islamic country” they “will be the first people beheaded and their heads played with… like a soccer ball on a field.”

Margulies apologized in an emailed statement to CNN on Friday, saying she is “horrified” that she “offended the Black and LGBTQIA+ communities, communities I truly love and respect.”

“I want to be 100% clear: Racism, homophobia, sexism, or any prejudice against anyone’s personal beliefs or identity are abhorrent to me, full stop,” she wrote. “Throughout my career I have worked tirelessly to combat hate of all kind, end antisemitism, speak out against terrorist groups like Hamas, and forge a united front against discrimination. I did not intend for my words to sow further division, for which I am sincerely apologetic.”

Somehow, though, Margulies’s comments aren’t the only offensive and bizarre celebrity commentary on Israel and Palestine. Last month, Susan Sarandon spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally and told the crowd, “There are a lot of people that are afraid, that are afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of how it feels to be Muslim in this country.” Sarandon issued an apology in a social media post last week saying the “phrasing” she chose “was a terrible mistake, as it implies that until recently Jews have been strangers to persecution, when the opposite is true.”

Anti-Semitic events have been a stubborn reality of life in the United States, from the defacement of synagogues to targeted assaults on Jews to a horrific mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018. By late October of this year, the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks anti-Semitic incidents in the United States, reported that the numbers were up by 400%.

Model Gigi Hadid posted a criticism of Israeli arrests and detentions of Palestinians, including children, but got so many of the facts wrong she eventually took it down and apologized for sharing “something that I did not fact check or deeply think about prior to reposting.” Several Hollywood figures who have opined about Israel or Palestine or both have seen swift professional consequences, from backlashes on social media to being dropped by their talent agencies.

Others have used more measured terms and mediated means to weigh in. In October, more than 700 celebrities and other Hollywood types signed onto an open letter condemning Hamas and urging the immediate return of Israeli hostages; that same month, hundreds of others signed onto an open letter urging President Joe Biden and Congress to “call for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza and Israel before another life is lost.”

Celebrities have said a lot about this war, some of them far too much. And yet some commentators are nevertheless incensed about the apparent celebrity “silence” on the war – by which they mean, of course, that not enough celebrities are speaking out in favor of their side.

It’s difficult to develop a hard-and-fast rule for celebrity political engagement. Most of us, I suspect, appreciate it when celebrities throw their influence behind the causes we care about, and are pretty disgusted when they publicly oppose the causes we support.

But we can expect a few things from people who are famous for their beauty or acting skills, not their mastery of international relations. First, we can ask that they speak when their conscience calls, not when the pressure to post calls.

Celebrities are human beings who are more knowledgeable and passionate about some issues than others, and also live under the microscope of fame. If they feel called to speak out on a particular issue, good for them. But if they feel insufficiently informed on it, or even scared of professional backlash, that’s ok too — whether Taylor Swift comments on the Israeli-Hamas war may shape the opinions of some Swifties and lend strength to one side of the social media battle but it is extremely unlikely to have any tangible effect on the conflict itself. (Swift has not made any statements on the issue. )

Second, we can also ask that when celebrities do post about politics or world events that they take extra care to make sure that they’re getting their facts right, and that they have at least a very basic understanding of what they’re discussing.

When celebrities post on social media, virality often follows, and their words can shape thousands of people’s perceptions and beliefs. They owe their followers a modicum of responsibility by fact-checking what they’re posting (or, even better, have staffers double and triple check).

Finally, it might be more helpful for all involved to take a step back and ask who it is we should actually be listening to and who we want to be speaking out. There are a great many people who are subject-matter experts and knowledgeable observers and human rights defenders and careful reporters, not to mention millions who are living the conflict as it happens. Most of them haven’t appeared on the big screen, starred in any reality TV shows, sold out Madison Square Garden, or walked in Fashion Week.

262,"Opinion: In Gaza, my 71-year-old mom watches over the rubble encasing her family","Editor’s Note: Hani Almadhoun is director of philanthropy at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency USA. He grew up in Gaza, where his family still live. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

Was this real?

My nephew’s voice broke. Although he was calling me from Greece, I couldn’t tell if his words were coming from 5,000 miles away, from my ears, or from my own racing, panicked heart.

It took a few seconds for the reality of what he was saying to sink in; akin to when a dark nightmare we bury deep within suddenly finds voice in another’s words, leaving us utterly shaken.

My brother Majed. His wife Safaa. Their children Riman, 18, Siwar, 13, Ali, 7…

And nine-year-old Omar, whose dream was to be a soccer player.

All six of them, my family members.

Gone.

At 5.00 a.m. in the morning, two hours before the announced truce came into effect, an Israeli airstrike killed my loved ones, along with their favorite cat, “Lucky,” while they laid in bed. As they either slept or deluded themselves into thinking they were asleep, shrapnel tore through the door and the ceiling that had shielded them for the past 45 days in Gaza. The very walls that once promised safety now crushed and trapped their bodies beneath tons of rubble.

Only Omar’s body was found, 20 meters away from the blast site. After this “fortune” of being found, the aspiring soccer player was hurriedly laid to rest.

The remains of my other family members still lie unrecovered, while my 71-year-old mother mourns in a pile of rubble, grieving for her tender and loving child. She hopes to shield their bodies from the hungry, stray dogs that roam nearby, fearing they might desecrate the sanctity of her son, his wife, and their precious children.

Days earlier, I was the one to share the news about the death of our cousin with my family over the phone from the US, only to discover they hadn’t heard about it yet. They live just minutes away but have been cut off from the rest of humanity for weeks now. They mourn the departed, yet there have been so many loved ones lost, leaving very little time to properly grieve. In a way, this cheapens the value of human life, where death itself becomes tragically abundant.

While some celebrate the meager number of humanitarian trucks granted entry into Gaza during the recent pause in fighting, it’s crucial to be aware that not a single commercial truck has entered since October 7. Barred from Gaza for two months, shelves of supermarkets remain bare, severely impacting everyone from civilians to humanitarian organizations that are already stretched past thin.

Water is scarce, and food has become so rare that a can of tuna fish would be considered noteworthy, not to mention the tenfold surge in prices for basic items like yeast, salt and canned beans. Cash is useless, leaving people to stand in breadlines, stripped of their dignity.

This is a facet rarely discussed in Gaza – people don’t want handouts, those with money would buy the things they need if only they could find them. Everyone is forced to rely on assistance now and not all organizations can effectively deliver it.

Before I lost connection with my mom, I heard close gunfire and shelling. Mom mentioned the Israeli military destroyed scores of residential buildings around them including our neighborhood mosque, stealing their right to worship, a place to seek solace or pray for the deceased.

This news struck me deeply – I’m grappling with a crisis of faith witnessing a genocide unfold, while my mother living under bombs and burying her loved ones still clings to her spirituality.

When I first began to write this days ago, I was pondering the fate of Palestinians in Gaza, and how life might change if this ruthless and bloody genocide were to cease. Far too many good people have been senselessly killed.

I wondered: who will step into the shoes of those gifted doctors, caring nurses and compassionate medical staff lost in Gaza?

Who will carry on the work of the hardened and experienced war reporters and storytellers who were killed in Gaza?

Hani Almadhoun with his brother Majed, who was killed in Gaza last week. Hani Almadhoun

Can anyone ever replace the hundreds of educators, teachers, counselors, some of whom perished in the very schools turned shelters where they nurtured young minds?

And what about the thousands of students who won’t return to school and university because their lives and aspirations were cut short by a ruthless and senseless military campaign?

Who will take up the roles of the hundreds of engineers, makers and builders who lost their lives in the very buildings and streets they helped create?

And those coders, software engineers, techies, entrepreneurs, craftsmen, chefs – all gone, leaving behind memories and a trail of heartache.

Who will have the courage to dream of a future when the present is so uncertain?

Most importantly, I thought:

Who will fill the void left by the thousands of mothers and fathers who lost their lives due to the Israeli military destruction, leaving Gaza shattered and its people terrorized and scared as long as they live?

Again, I call on President Joe Biden to do everything in his power to stop the fighting and implement a permanent ceasefire, to stop the killing before other innocents in Gaza lose their lives.

These are irreplaceable individuals, not merely statistics or collateral damage but people cherished deeply by their loved ones.

In mere moments, they were tragically taken away forever.

I thought of those individuals deeply this week as I finally managed to speak to my family after two full weeks of no communication. There were numerous tears shed, unspoken words, and silences that seemed to scratch one’s soul.

Now, above all of these losses, I find that on the morning after Thanksgiving, at 5.00 a.m. in Gaza, the world lost a star soccer player. And all of these questions collapse on themselves.

Rest in peace, Omar.

You did nothing wrong. Your only crime was that you were born a Palestinian child.

CNN —

There’s a whole cottage industry in pop culture essay writing dedicated to trying to unpack why Taylor Swift is so successful. Is it because she’s the epitome of Americana? Or the ultimate vehicle for “millennial vibes”? Champion of the underdogs? The final girlboss?

Jeff Yang CNN

In fact, her popularity is anchored in the way she manages to be all of these things, and none of them for very long, pivoting effortlessly from persona to persona and position to position; shedding her skin when necessary (like the “snake” she was famously compared to by Kim Kardashian) to reveal fresh new colors beneath.

Constant reinvention is a given in pop iconhood, as countless prior and peer artists — from Michael Jackson and Madonna to Britney Spears and Justin Bieber — can attest. But no one else does it with the same casual, frictionless aplomb as Swift; her self-shifts don’t come off as acts of extravagant pick-me theater in the mode of Ariana Grande, or explosive artistic statements a la Beyoncé. Instead, they’re more like chord changes; variations in the key of Tay — eyebrow-raising, but never too extreme or off-putting. Which means that throughout all of her evolutions, she has remained accessible, approachable, personable and projectable; a cool hang for the guys, trusted bestie to the girls.

This careful balancing act has been a key reason why she’s stayed relevant across a career of nearly two decades. And it’s why she’ll undoubtedly reach the milestone of best-selling female solo artist of all time (at over 180 million albums sold according to ChartMasters.org, only Celine Dion at more than 220 million and Madonna at 250 million stand in her way).

The truth is, though, simply selling albums almost seems quaint now as a benchmark of Swiftian achievement. She’s now increasingly being spoken about as an economic force of nature, a transformative creator advocate, organizer and innovator and arguably the most influential — perhaps even the most powerful — figure in the music industry.

It was Swift who, in reaction to Scooter Braun acquiring the company controlling her early music masters, chose the almost unthinkable path of re-recording her old albums one by one, creating versions of her classic songs that are now under her direct control. The move isn’t just an act of revenge against someone whose actions she’s referred to publicly as “bullying.” It’s a rebel stroke that cuts at the heart of the recording industry’s power over creators, and one that was only possible because Swift is songwriter on all of her original music, and because of the uniquely equitable contract she signed with her current label, Republic Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. Under the terms of that contract, Swift demanded full ownership of all of her master recordings going forward, plus a royalty of at least 50%.

That said, it’s another clause in the agreement that demonstrates the full weight of Swift’s power: In an unprecedented move that seals her status as a kind of Joan of Arc for creator rights, she said she also got Universal, a major investor in Spotify, to agree that if it were to ever sell any of its shares, a non-recoupable split of those profits would be shared with Swift and all other fellow Universal recording artists.

Swift has used the occasion of her reinvention of her musical past to launch an extended global performance circuit, the “Eras” tour, which could become the most lucrative music tour in history. It will, all in, represent a $5.7 billion boost to the US economy according to the Washington Post, while injecting a profound degree of monetary stimulus into every city hosting her, given that her fans collectively spend around $93 million per show.

In Los Angeles, where she played six sold-out nights at SoFi Stadium, the tour generated enough money to support 3,300 jobs. And Swift generously showered her staff with spiffs, giving each of her tour truck drivers $100,000 in the summer, and providing other bonuses to her sound techs, backup dancers, catering crew and other staff, to the collective tune of $55 million. She can afford it. Already a billionaire, Swift stands to personally make as much as $4.1 billion from the “Eras” tour, according to estimates cited by the Post.

That doesn’t even include the money she stands to earn from the concert film she shot while on tour, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” which in yet another example of I’ll-do-it-myself disruption she paid for out of her own pocket as an independent production, eschbewing studio involvement, and subsequently distributed it via theater chain AMC. It has already earned more than $250 million at the box office, reportedly just under 60% of which will go straight to Swift’s production company, which will get another revenue bump when the film hits streaming platforms for rental and download on Dec. 13, Swift’s 34th birthday.

Many have pointed out that her outsized success has nepo baby roots — the daughter of a Merrill Lynch stockbroker, she grew up on an 11-acre Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania, and her dad helped to boost her early success by buying part of her original label, Big Machine Records. Swift would have had a much harder road in her path to stardom, which began when she moved to the country music mecca of Nashville, had she not been White, a privilege she herself has acknowledged in recent years.

Still, it’s Swift’s undeniable talent, her resourcefulness and her (blond) ambition that have gotten her where she is — that is to say, the very top. I admit to personally being a begrudging fan, not just of her music, but her incredible sense of enterprise. I take mental notes with every new move she makes — and if someone else doesn’t write a bestselling business tome detailing the lessons would-be moguls should learn from Swift’s savvy, I will.

264,Biden administration announces new financial strike force to curb deadly fentanyl trade,"Washington CNN —

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday announced a new Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force to crack down on the illicit financial networks supporting the cartels and drug traffickers that help funnel the drug into the United States.

The new strike force, part of the department’s efforts to tackle the deadly fentanyl trade, will streamline personnel and resources across the agency to better leverage its expertise in countering the financial crimes that back the networks supporting the fentanyl trade, according to the Treasury Department.

“The Treasury Department’s Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force will allow us to bring the Department’s unrivaled expertise in fighting financial crime to bear against this deadly epidemic. Treasury will use every tool at its disposal to disrupt the ability of drug traffickers to peddle this poison in our country,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement Monday.

The strike force will be led by the department’s top sanctions official, Brian Nelson, and the chief of the Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigations unit, James Lee. It will “redouble Treasury’s existing work streams, including using financial intelligence to understand risks and map transnational criminal organization (TCO) financial networks,” according to a news release.

Several key units within the Treasury Department that specialize in financial crimes, sanctions, and tracking terrorist and illicit financing will be part of the new strike force. These include: the IRS criminal investigation unit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes.

The new strike force’s key goals include combining analytic expertise across the Treasury Department to help identify opportunities to go after money laundering and fentanyl trafficking networks; strengthening coordination on investigating sanctions violations; and creating closer coordination when working with foreign partners on identifying international money laundering networks.

The new initiative comes after the US and China recently reached a deal on curbing fentanyl production, and as the US Treasury Department has taken an increasingly active role in addressing the threat posed by fentanyl.

“The Strike Force will act quickly and decisively with the top specialists from across the Department to nimbly respond to the newest threats,” Nelson, who has traveled to the US southern border at least twice this year, said in a statement.

Investigators from the Treasury Department can access and share powerful financial data with enforcement bodies such as the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Department of Homeland Security as they work to track and disrupt the fentanyl trade and drug suppliers. The new strike force will also help streamline the Treasury Department’s efforts to coordinate with local and federal law enforcement bodies on potential financial leads.

As part of his talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, President Joe Biden said that China agreed to go after the companies that produce the precursor chemicals to fentanyl.

And earlier this year, the Biden administration announced a broad effort to target the production and distribution of fentanyl, which included criminal charges from the Department of Justice and a host of new Treasury sanctions. The announcement built off an executive order signed in 2021 that expanded the Treasury Department’s authorities to target the distribution chains of fentanyl and other narcotics.

There has been a governmentwide push to curb synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, which are the main driver of overdose deaths in the US. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there has been a more than sevenfold increase in deaths from 2015 to 2021, and despite a recent slowing, overdose deaths still hover near record levels and remain the third-leading cause of death in adolescents ages 19 and younger.

The new strike force will not undermine the Treasury Department’s other sanctions regimes, including targeting Russia’s war machine amid its invasion of Ukraine, but rather will ensure the department is “most efficiently” deploying its “limited” resources, a senior Treasury official told CNN.

Yellen and Nelson will travel to Mexico this week for a series of meetings with their Mexican counterparts and private financial institutions to further discuss how the two countries can better target the illicit financial networks fueling the flow of synthetic opioids into the United States and deepen the bilateral economic relationship as the US looks to “friend-shore” supply chains, according to senior Treasury officials.

“Friend-shoring” is a Biden administration goal to strengthen US economic resilience by diversifying US supply chains with friendly countries.","['sanctions', 'department', 'departments', 'drug', 'financial', 'fentanyl', 'force', 'deadly', 'trade', 'announces', 'strike', 'biden', 'administration', 'networks', 'curb', 'treasury']","“The Treasury Department’s Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force will allow us to bring the Department’s unrivaled expertise in fighting financial crime to bear against this deadly epidemic.

265,"Sen. Murphy open to placing conditions on aid to Israel, calls civilian death toll in Gaza ‘unacceptable’","CNN —

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy on Sunday said he was open to placing conditions on any aid to Israel, with the aim of reducing civilian casualties in Gaza.

The Connecticut Democrat, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” that as lawmakers return to the Capitol Monday with the elusive goal of passing aid to Israel and Ukraine, they will discuss how to structure aid to Israel so it is used in line with human rights laws. His comments, on the third day of the truce between Israel and Hamas, come as other lawmakers — on both sides of the aisle — either didn’t rule out the idea of conditions on aid or underscored concern about minimizing civilian Palestinian casualties.

“We regularly condition our aid to allies based upon compliance with US law and international law. And, so, I think it’s very consistent with the ways in which we have dispensed aid, especially during wartime, to allies, for us to talk about making sure that the aid we give Ukraine or the aid we give Israel is used in accordance with human rights laws,” Murphy said. “And that’ll be a conversation we will all be engaged in when we get back to Washington on Monday.”

Murphy has previously called on Israel to try to further reduce civilian casualties and to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, where more than 14,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry there, in the wake of Hamas’ brutal cross-border assault on Israel on October 7.

“I do believe that the level of civilian harm inside Gaza has been unacceptable and is unsustainable,” he said. “I think there’s both a moral cost to this many civilians, innocent civilians, children often, losing their life, but I think there’s (also) a strategic cost. Ultimately, Hamas will get stronger, not weaker, in the long run if all of this civilian death allows them to recruit more effectively and ably inside Gaza.”

But Murphy also said that Israel has a “moral obligation” to continue fighting Hamas following the temporary four-day truce between Hamas and Israel, which is now in its third day.

“Hopefully, Hamas will accept the conditions that have been laid down that will allow for more hostages to be released. But if they don’t, ultimately Hamas is going to be defeated,” added Murphy. “That’s in Israel’s interest, but it’s also in the interest of the United States. We do not want terrorist organizations believing they can get away with the kind of murder that Hamas did on October 7.”

The Biden administration has pleaded with lawmakers to come together to pass aid for Ukraine and Israel, but disputes over supporting Ukraine — and now over immigration policy — have marred the talks.

Some progressives have proposed adding strict restrictions on aid, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who released an extensive list of proposed demands for the Israeli government to receive US aid, including “an end to the indiscriminate bombing,” a “right of displaced Gazans to return to their homes,” “a freeze on settlement expansion” in the West Bank and no long-term occupation of Gaza by Israeli forces, as well as a commitment to engage in peace talks “for a two-state solution in the wake of the war.”

Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet indicated to CBS in an interview Sunday that he is open to supporting conditions on aid to Israel. “I haven’t so far, but I think that’s a debate we’re going to have in the coming days,” the Colorado senator, who services on the Intelligence Committee, said on “Face the Nation.”

House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, told NBC Sunday that while he wouldn’t propose placing conditions on aid to Israel aimed at lessening civilian casualties in Gaza, it is already the policy of the US and Israel.

“I think the White House has been clear, and I think US policy has been clear, of lessening the Palestinian casualties that are not Hamas,” Turner said on “Meet the Press,” adding that Israel has issued warnings to civilians about which areas will be targeted. “I wouldn’t propose it, but I think it does accurately reflect US policy.”

Murphy on Sunday also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s previous policies toward Palestinians, saying, “Benjamin Netanyahu believed that you could ignore the Palestinians, that you could try to squash their desires for a state and, ultimately, that would bring peace to the region into Israel. That’s just not the case.”

He continued, “Ultimately, the next government is going to have to put us back on a path to have a Palestinian state. That’s not easy, but it is the only way forward for Israel, is the only way forward for long-term peace.”

266,"Florida GOP chair defies DeSantis, won’t step down as new details of sexual assault allegation emerge","CNN —

The head of Florida’s Republican Party indicated Saturday he will not step down while facing an investigation into sexual assault, rejecting calls by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to give up his role as the party’s top operative.

In a letter to the state GOP, chairman Christian Ziegler did not address the allegation – which continued to send shockwaves through the state on Saturday as troubling new details about the investigation emerged – but suggested a conspiracy was afoot to leak details from the Sarasota Police Department probe.

“We have a country to save and I am not going to let false allegations of a crime put that mission on the bench as I wait for this process to wrap up,” he wrote.

According to a search warrant affidavit, which CNN obtained from the Florida Center for Government Accountability, Ziegler and his wife Bridget planned a three-way sexual encounter with the alleged victim on the day of the alleged assault on October 2, and “when the victim learned that Bridget could not make it, she changed her mind and canceled with Christian.”

Surveillance video showed Ziegler arriving at the alleged victim’s residence on the day of the alleged assault, the affidavit says. The alleged victim told investigators she “opened her apartment door to walk her dog and Christian was standing outside in the hallway.” The alleged victim said Christian entered the apartment and raped her on a bar stool, according to the affidavit.

“The victim advised Christian did not wear a condom,” the affidavit said. The alleged victim said she told Christian “she was not in a place to consent” because “she had been drinking tequila all day.”

The alleged victim later called her sister and told her she had been raped, the affidavit states, noting that police interviewed the alleged victim’s sister and confirmed the details of the phone call.

Police then interviewed Bridget Ziegler, according to the affidavit. She told detectives she knew the alleged victim through her husband and confirmed having a sexual encounter with the alleged victim and her husband “over a year ago and that it only happened one time.”

On November 2, detectives interviewed Ziegler with his attorney present, the affidavit states. Ziegler admitted to having sex with the alleged victim, but said the sex was consensual and that he recorded the encounter. “Christian said he initially deleted the video, but since the allegation, he uploaded the video to his Google Drive which we have not been able to locate upon a digital extraction.”

During the investigation, police said Ziegler tried to contact the alleged victim via Instagram. The alleged victim then began communicating with Ziegler with the help of detectives, according to the affidavit. In one alleged exchange on October 27, the alleged victim wrote: “I’m not okay with what happened the other day between us”.

“Oh. That’s not good. You are my friend. Known ya for like twenty years now. Lol,” Ziegler replied.

“Yeah I know but that was not cool and you didn’t bring her [Bridget] and then did that to me,” the alleged victim responded.

“She was in. Then couldn’t because no response. She said in next time,” Ziegler replied.

Several phone calls between the alleged victim and Ziegler were audio recorded, according to the affidavit. In one call, the alleged victim allegedly told Ziegler “he sexually assault her” and Ziegler replied, “Those are big words, please don’t, no I didn’t. You invited me in, that’s it. I did not at all, and I never want you to feel that way.”

CNN has made multiple attempts to contact the Zieglers. In a statement Friday, Christian Ziegler’s attorney Derek Byrd said: “We are confident that once the police investigation is concluded that no charges will be filed and Mr. Ziegler will be completely exonerated.”

“Unfortunately, public figures are often accused of acts that they did not commit whether it be for political purposes or financial gain. I would caution anyone to rush to judgment until the investigation is concluded,” Byrd said.

The allegations have not only raised questions about Christian Ziegler’s capacity to lead the party into the 2024 election season but have drawn acute criticism because of the role the Zieglers have played in helping to execute a crackdown on LGBTQ materials in Florida schools under DeSantis.

Bridget Ziegler, 41, a thrice-elected Sarasota County school board member, co-founded Moms for Liberty, a conservative parents’ rights organization that has led the efforts in Florida and beyond to remove books from classrooms they deem inappropriate for kids. She has also served as a close ally of DeSantis in his crackdown on removing sexual orientation and gender identity from schools. She helped author the Parents Bill of Rights in Florida, a law DeSantis signed in 2021 in response to concerns from conservative parents that schools were withholding information about children expressing a change in sexual orientation and gender identity.

This year, DeSantis named Bridget Ziegler to the board that now oversees the Walt Disney Company’s special taxing district in Central Florida amid his clash with the entertainment giant over a state law that restricted how sexual orientation and gender identity could be taught in the classroom.

Christian Ziegler, 40, has also fiercely defended DeSantis’ agenda against national backlash from LGTBQ groups. In an interview with the Washington Examiner, he said Democrats who opposed DeSantis were “perverted” and encouraged them to leave the state.

In his letter to the state GOP, Ziegler suggested that the information made public about the investigation was intentionally leaked because he and his wife are “such loud political voices.” He said the complaint and investigation should have remained confidential until the conclusion of the investigation, and that he could not publicly share his side of the story at this point in the process.

The letter came a day after DeSantis said Ziegler should step down as party chairman, telling reporters “I don’t see how we can continue with that investigation ongoing, given the gravity of those situations.”

“I think he should step aside,” DeSantis said. “I think he should tend to that.”

“I’ve known him. I’ve known Bridget. They’ve been friends, but the mission is more important,” he added.

Ziegler, though, outlined a timeline to remain in power. He told the party that his “role in the investigation is complete” and he anticipated a conclusion to the probe.

“When we reach that point, I will have a lot more to share about the facts, how this transpired, the motive and who was behind it,” he said.","['florida', 'investigation', 'emerge', 'ziegler', 'alleged', 'gop', 'victim', 'affidavit', 'step', 'desantis', 'defies', 'chair', 'told', 'christian', 'details', 'sexual', 'wont']","Ziegler admitted to having sex with the alleged victim, but said the sex was consensual and that he recorded the encounter.

267,Sen. Graham says he has ‘lost all confidence’ in Defense Sec. Lloyd Austin,"CNN —

GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham on Sunday called Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin “naive” for believing further civilian casualties in Gaza could produce even more insurgents and said he has “lost all confidence” in him.

“He’s so naive, I mean I just lost all confidence in this guy,” Graham told CNN’s Dana Bash, adding later, “This is a radicalized population. I don’t want to kill innocent people, but Israel is fighting not just Hamas, but the infrastructure around Hamas.”

Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum Saturday, Austin said he has “personally pushed Israeli leaders to avoid civilian casualties, and to shun irresponsible rhetoric, and to prevent violence by settlers in the West Bank, and to dramatically expand access to humanitarian aid.”

“You see, in this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat,” Austin said.

Graham, on “State of the Union,” disagreed: “Strategic defeat would be inflaming the Palestinians? They’re already inflamed. They are taught from the time they’re born to hate the Jews and to kill them.”

The South Carolina Republican said the retired Army general and former commander of US Central Command “is telling Israel things that are impossible to achieve” and called on Austin to “quit criticizing Israel in public.”

“Secretary Austin, the reason Palestinians are dying: Gaza is so condensed, Hamas has tunnels under apartments, under schools, under hospitals,” Graham said.

Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed at least 15,207 people and injured at least 40,652 others, Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza, saidSaturday.

He added that he understands the theory of what retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal has called “insurgent math,” an idea that collateral civilian death in warfare can be a catalyst for creating insurgents, but argued Gaza’s population “has been radicalized for decades.”

“If we were attacked like this, which we were in 9/11, if somebody called for us within two months to have a ceasefire against al-Qaeda, we would’ve laughed them out of town,” he said.

Graham also criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, who on Saturday during a news conference in Dubai said that “too many innocent Palestinians have been killed” as she met with the leaders of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan during her trip to the COP28 climate summit.

Graham questioned, “What is too many people dying in World War II after Pearl Harbor?”

“Vice President Harris, tell Israel how to destroy Hamas in a way not to hurt innocent Palestinians, and I’ll pass it along,” he said.

“No Republican believes this, by the way,” he added. “No Republican is telling Israel to change your military tactics.”","['civilian', 'sen', 'lloyd', 'austin', 'hamas', 'palestinians', 'graham', 'israel', 'sec', 'population', 'defense', 'confidence', 'republican', 'called', 'gaza', 'innocent', 'lost']","CNN —GOP Sen.

268,Johnson moves to corral GOP hardliners as tension grows in ranks,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had a bone to pick with the new speaker.

Ahead of the Thanksgiving recess, the Georgia Republican was frustrated that GOP lawmakers helped defeat her effort to force a vote on impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. And Greene – who has publicly insulted her Republican colleagues over their opposition to impeachment – also told CNN she was concerned about a “very serious situation” she experienced with an unnamed “male Republican of the conference,” declining to go into further details.

Normally, she would march straight into former Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s office, where she often got swift results. But Greene said she had a tougher time connecting with Speaker Mike Johnson, who doesn’t have a strong relationship with the congresswoman. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, was supposed to call her before the holiday break to listen to her concerns, according to Greene, but never did.

“I haven’t heard much from him,” Greene told CNN earlier this week.

The pair ultimately connected on Thursday ahead of another divisive vote she was planning to force on removing Mayorkas. Greene said Johnson heard her out and gave her assurances that her impeachment articles would move through committee and on to the floor. Greene then opted to pull her Mayorkas impeachment resolution – at least for now.

The episode involving Greene, the full details of which have not been previously reported, illustrates how Johnson is still learning how to wrangle the hardliners in his conference – a crucial skill for governing over a rambunctious and razor-thin majority that just got even smaller after the expulsion of indicted former Rep. George Santos. Taking a page from his predecessor’s playbook, Johnson has tried to dole out commitments and face-time to some of his potential critics. But so far, the speaker’s strategy has had mixed results.

After GOP Rep. Max Miller gave a searing public rebuke of Johnson’s recent decision-making on an Israel aid package, the speaker tried to arrange a sit-down meeting with the freshman lawmaker, presumably to smooth things over, according to sources familiar with the situation.

The Ohio Republican, however, has rebuffed Johnson’s entreaties, telling CNN he is “very upset.”

“I have chosen not to talk to him at this moment in time. He’s got his hands full with other things and until he can show me that he can lead I’m not going to waste my time sitting down with him,” Miller said.

Asked to give Johnson a grade on his performance, he said he’d give him a “D-minus. I’ve lost a lot of faith so far.”

And then there’s Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus who has continued to create headaches for Republican leaders with his outspoken criticism, questioning what his own party has accomplished since taking the majority.

When asked how Johnson has tried to handle the situation, Roy told CNN: “We’re still having conversations. The question here is what’s going to end up being delivered, but you know, we’ll see.”

But in other instances, Johnson has had success in taming some of the party’s loudest rebels – a sign that the speaker, who himself hails from the conservative wing of the party, has the ability to make inroads where McCarthy could not.

GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida – who led the charge to oust McCarthy as speaker – was among those personally pushing Johnson to sign off on subpoenas for Hunter and James Biden and publicly release the footage from the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, according to sources familiar with the situation. Those early moves from Johnson earned swift applause from Gaetz and the right flank.

And GOP Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, signaled this week they would no longer demand the $1.47 trillion topline spending number the caucus had been seeking all summer, saying they’d be amenable to the $1.59 trillion number agreed to in the bipartisan debt limit deal that enraged conservatives and helped lead to McCarthy’s ouster. The group even held the House hostage for days until McCarthy agreed to back off the deal he cut with the White House to seek even deeper cuts, a decision that has led to the current impasse over government spending on Capitol Hill.

“Certainly some members of the Freedom Caucus allowed their hatred of Kevin McCarthy to cloud their judgment and that misjudgment on their part weakened the Republican Conference and as a result made it harder for us to deliver conservative wins,” said Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican. “So, yes, that McCarthy derangement was real.”

Veteran GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma acknowledged, “It’s a challenge around here, no matter who the speaker is.”

“There is a lot of different personalities. We have a lot of different groups and points of view in the conference,” he told CNN. “But I’m very pleased with how well he is handling it.”

Internal feuds on full display

One of Johnson’s chief challenges has been dealing with the feuds in his bitterly divided party, where members have been in open warfare with one another in the wake of McCarthy’s unprecedented ouster.

Greene has been among the most difficult for Johnson on that front, openly bashing her Republican colleagues and using procedural tools to force a series of floor votes on divisive issues – tactics that have rubbed her colleagues the wrong way and put her increasingly on an island inside the GOP.

“It’s not right. She’s not a team player,” Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican who represents a district in Nebraska won by President Joe Biden in 2020, told CNN. “It’s all about individual stuff. We have a speaker, a chairman, for a reason. We should respect their word.”

After her failed attempt to force a vote on impeaching Mayorkas, Greene lashed out at GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California on social media, using emojis to question his manhood for siding with Democrats to defeat the effort.

In an interview, Issa would not say if her tactics are helpful. “That’s really a question for the speaker. It’s a question for the majority leader. It’s a question for the whip.”

Asked if he would consider her a productive member, Issa smiled and said: “Well, she does do a lot.”

And Greene also criticized GOP Rep. Tom McClintock of California, who delivered a floor speech this week railing against Greene for being “reckless” and “shooting from the hip” with her tactics on impeachment.

“I would urge my colleagues not to undermine a legitimate impeachment inquiry with hyper partisan, hysterical bombast,” McClintock told CNN.

Greene, who was booted from the Freedom Caucus earlier this year for being too cozy with McCarthy, also repeatedly attacked Roy for opposing her resolution to censure Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib for attending an pro-Palestinian protest, which Greene referred to in her resolution as an “insurrection.”

But Greene – who McCarthy brought into the fold in an attempt to keep the congresswoman’s behavior in check – said she has no regrets about her feuds with her colleagues, a sign she has little intention of backing down.

“I’ll remind everyone that I didn’t come here to make friends,” Greene said. She said that any Republicans who are “upset could talk to me anytime they’d like.”

“My position will be that we need to be doing the jobs that we promised to our voters … instead of just talking tough on the campaign trail and then coming up here and falling apart,” Greene told CNN.

Meanwhile, there’s also some unhappiness with Johnson and the leadership team for voting against expelling Santos, even though GOP leaders did not whip the vote and encouraged members to vote their conscience.

“This is just another example of Republicans who can’t lead. And that’s really shameful,” Miller said. “The speaker and everyone in leadership knows that this man is a crook.”

Hardliners could still create headaches on spending

While the far right has signaled it is willing to soften some of their spending demands, funding will still be a sticky issue for Johnson in the months ahead.

The House GOP convened a conference meeting on Thursday morning, which has not been previously reported, to hash out their plans for upcoming spending issues – including how to handle a White House push for an Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and border security package.

GOP Rep. Bob Good of Virginia said the Freedom Caucus made clear to the speaker on Thursday what their expectations are. That includes keeping aid for Israel and Ukraine separated, a plan to cut spending and secure the border, and a commitment not to attach a reauthorization of a controversial surveillance program to the annual defense bill.

“It’s been an effective effort – in conference this morning, and in subsequent meetings that took place after conference – to let leadership know what to put some red lines on,” Good told CNN.

Roy, meanwhile, expressed his frustrations during the closed-door conference meeting, according to attendees.

“I think everyone’s on edge right now, frustration levels are higher,” California Rep. Mike Garcia said after the meeting on Thursday. “So we need to come together as a team regardless of how frustrated we are.”

Before Thanksgiving, Roy gave an impassioned speech on the House floor where he demanded his GOP colleagues give him “one thing” Republicans have done since reclaiming the House majority – comments that infuriated Republican lawmakers and gave instant ammunition to Democrats.

This week, Roy doubled down on his position, and organized a “power hour” of speeches on the House floor to continue airing his grievances. But he also made clear his beef is not personal.

“Mike is one of the finest human beings I know. He’s a good man, he’s a conservative.” Roy told CNN. “Look, whoever is in the seat has got to figure out how to manage all of this. That’s the job. So, he’ll figure it out.”","['ranks', 'mccarthy', 'speaker', 'rep', 'gop', 'corral', 'tension', 'hardliners', 'republican', 'moves', 'greene', 'told', 'johnson', 'house', 'conference', 'grows']","But Greene said she had a tougher time connecting with Speaker Mike Johnson, who doesn’t have a strong relationship with the congresswoman.

269,Shoes and germs: Should you ask your party guests to go barefoot?,"Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.

CNN —

At-home holiday parties are on many people’s calendars right now, and germ-conscious hosts are faced with a dilemma: Should I require my guests to take off their shoes at the door, especially if the gathering is cocktail or formal attire — or the guest is a stylish shoeaholic like Carrie Bradshaw?

In a 2003 “Sex and the City” episode, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is asked to leave her $485 Manolo Blahnik shoes at the door during a New York City baby shower hosted by her friend Kyra (Tatum O’Neal) and soon finds they have been stolen.

“I hadn’t even done a full lap around the party,” Carrie lamented later at a lunch with her friends. The iconic TV character had been forced to walk home in her party dress and old gray sneakers lent by her host.

“Why in the h*ll did you take off your shoes to begin with?” asked Carrie’s friend Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall).

“We had to!” Carrie explained. “For their kids — apparently we drag things in on our heels that make children sick.”

While the episode, “A Woman’s Right to Shoes,” was designed to discuss dilemmas facing single people in a world focused on families with children, the underlying question — and debate — around footwear and health remains: Is there significant evidence going shoeless stops the spread of germs in a home?

“Absolutely,” said Gabriel Filippelli, chancellor’s professor for the department of Earth sciences at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and executive director of Indiana University’s Environmental Resilience Institute.

“We can track in all sorts of bacteria, but certainly some of the ones we’re most concerned about are E. coli that cause severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting,” he said. “There’s been studies that swab the bottom of shoes and something like 99% of the shoes test positive for fecal material.”

Heavy metals and more

However, bacteria are not the only danger that rides along with the dust and dirt surrounding rural and urban homes, gardens and parks, said Jill Litt, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado in Boulder who is currently working as a senior researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, or ISGlobal, in Spain.

“Studies have shown that in urban areas where there are older homes, lead in dust can be tracked into the home on the surface of shoes,” she said. “Other studies have shown that you can bring in pesticide residues from gardens via shoes.”

Heavy metals like lead and copper and zinc permeate the soils of urban parks and streets from decades of pollutants, while pesticide levels can be high in rural agricultural areas, Litt added.

Homes built before 1978 are very likely to contain lead-based paint, which can chip, peel and disintegrate into dangerous dust, experts say. There is no safe level of lead at any age, but children are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of heavy metals and pesticides due to their small size and proximity to contaminants as they crawl, roll and play on the floors of the home.

“For little ones, hand to mouth is one of the primary ways children get exposed to toxic substances and infectious disease agents,” said Litt, who is also a leader of Reimagining Environments for Connection and Engagement: Testing Actions for Social Prescribing in Natural Spaces. Funded by the European Union, the project aims to fight loneliness with natural spaces.

Wet mop first

Before you ask folks to take off their shoes, be sure the home is as dust-free as possible, experts say. Never vacuum or sweep with a broom first, as that will only stir up all the toxins, sending them airborne. Instead, reach for the wet or spray mop. As counterintuitive as it may be to add water to dirt, it’s actually the best way to remove toxins, Litt said.

The same goes for any horizontal surface, Filippelli said, but stay away from feather dusters. “Do more regular cleaning of horizontal surfaces with a damp cloth — that’s windowsills, tables, coffee tables, chair bottoms, chair seats and other furniture in addition to the floor.”

Use the “three-bucket” method if you live in an older home with lead paint or an area with high levels of lead outside. Have one bucket ready with an all-purpose cleaning solution, another to rinse and an empty bucket.

“Some folks also use a very weak vinegar solution in their wash water, which works really well,” Filippelli said. “There are some super sterilizers on the market, but when cleaners are really good at killing bacteria, they’re usually not very good for us as human beings. Whenever you can smell a superstrong smell from something, you got to at least think twice about it.”

Dip your mop into the cleaning solution, squeeze the excess water into the empty bucket, and begin to mop, starting from the farthest point from the door. Work toward the door, using the clean water as a rinse as you go. Flush water into the toilet when it looks dirty or with each new room — don’t throw it outside.

“The highest concentration of germs is in the interior entry way and levels go down as you move greater distances from this area,” Litt said. “Carpeting retains a lot of dust so that would be one thing I would remove if you had concerns about dusts and potential health concerns.”

Carpeted areas should be vacuumed with a device that has a high-efficiency particulate air, or HEPA, filter, not bagless vacuums, and throw the bag or filter away in an outside trash can when done.

Honor cold feet

Taking off shoes at the door may be the best way to limit germs and potentially toxic dust from coming inside, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t think of your guests’ comfort, Filippelli said. Providing washable slippers or nonslip socks can be a thoughtful gesture.

“I do not like to walk around with bare feet inside, so here’s my hack. I have some warm slippers right inside my front door — a lot of other cultures do that as well,” he said.

“Go to any Asian household, or even a Middle Eastern one and there’s often a little cubby right inside the door with washable slippers. You’re supposed to take your shoes off there and take the slippers and put those on.”

Would that have solved Carrie’s shoe-removal problems? No, those were taken care of when she asked Kyra to buy new Manolo’s as a gift for Carrie’s impending marriage — to herself.

“That’s all she registered for?” Kyra asked the salesperson, as her kids ran around the swanky Manolo Blahnik store on Madison Avenue.","['guests', 'litt', 'lead', 'water', 'slippers', 'party', 'right', 'germs', 'door', 'dust', 'carrie', 'shoes', 'barefoot', 'ask', 'asked']","“I hadn’t even done a full lap around the party,” Carrie lamented later at a lunch with her friends.

270,‘The Brick’ is at the center of our galaxy. An unexpected new finding may help unlock its mysteries,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

A box-shaped cloud of opaque dust that lies at the center of our galaxy has long perplexed scientists, and observations that reveal a new detail about its composition are deepening the mystery — possibly upending what’s known about how stars form.

The cloud, nicknamed “the Brick” for its visual impenetrability and rectangular appearance, was previously estimated to hold more than 100,000 times the mass of the sun. And such a dense blob should be churning out massive new stars, based on researchers’ current understanding of star formation.

But it’s not.

The Brick is largely dormant. And the latest observations, made using the James Webb Space Telescope, did not reveal any hidden, young stars.

The new Webb data instead unveiled that the Brick is not just made up of gas. It’s also littered with frozen carbon monoxide — much more than previously expected — according to a study published Monday in The Astrophysical Journal. And there’s more ice forming deeper into the Brick.

The findings could have drastic implications for how scientists analyze this region going forward. More carbon monoxide ice inside the Brick could dramatically change how researchers study and measure dark clouds in the center of the Milky Way.

“We are (now) closer to understanding what exactly is happening in the Brick and where the mass is,” said University of Florida astronomer Adam Ginsburg, lead author of the study. “But we opened more questions than we closed with this.”

Among those questions: Why and where is this carbon monoxide freezing into ice?

Other mysteries that loom for this region remain unanswered as well: Why can’t we see any new stars forming? Is the Brick not as dense as scientists once believed? And what are the strange ridge- and filament-like features that show up within the Brick?

“We have more to investigate before we can really be sure what’s going on,” Ginsburg said. “I would say we’re in the hypothesis-forming phase, not the drawing conclusions phase.”

What Webb revealed

Ginsburg and his fellow researchers, which included University of Florida graduate students, first got their hands on this new Webb data in September 2022.

It was a crucial moment. As the most powerful space telescope ever constructed, Webb could offer never-before-seen insights into the Brick. But right off the bat, Ginsburg and his team found the data needed a lot of work. The Webb telescope orients itself using a map, determining which direction it’s pointing by referencing where it is in relation to known stars.

The trouble was, “there’s so many stars at the galactic center that it gets confused,” Ginsburg said. So, researchers had to spend months cleaning up the data, orienting it to line up correctly with the existing maps of the sky.

Then, as they peered at the Brick, they found that the images from Webb were turning out the wrong color.

“All the stars were coming out a bit too blue,” Ginsburg said, prompting researchers to wonder if something was wrong with the data.

But it turned out, he said, the problem was with their assumptions. The scientists hadn’t expected there to be so much carbon monoxide ice — and that was the cause of the color change, according to the study.

Learning of the existence of the ice could have broad ripple effects for all kinds of research into the center of the Milky Way, said Dr. Natalie Butterfield, an assistant scientist at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, who was not involved in the study.

Butterfield said her own research — which includes studying supernovae and the radiation between star systems — could be forever altered by understanding the existence of this carbon monoxide ice. It could change how scientists estimate the mass of all the clouds in the galactic center.

Why carbon monoxide matters

There are several perplexing things about all this carbon monoxide ice. For instance, the area is fairly warm — around 60 Kelvin (minus 351.67 degrees Fahrenheit) — while carbon monoxide typically freezes at 20 Kelvin.

It could be that the dust inside the Brick is much colder than the gas, causing the carbon monoxide around the dust particles to turn solid. Or, Ginsburg said, it could be that water is freezing, trapping carbon monoxide inside.

The answer matters.

All the ice in a region such as the Brick can give scientists new insight into our solar system — even our home planet.

The ice and water that exist on Earth, for example, likely arrived here via comets. So, where ice exists in the universe and how it forms can help researchers understand where these comets come from and how they collected the materials they deposited.

Where are the stars?

And then there is the big mystery of why there is a lack of star formation within the Brick.

Scientists already know that new stars are brewed from dust clouds and hydrogen molecules. But scientists cannot directly observe hydrogen molecules within the Brick — or anywhere else in the universe — because they’re invisible to telescopes.

However, scientists also know that for every hydrogen molecule, there’s likely a certain amount of carbon monoxide. And carbon monoxide is visible — so scientists can measure it as a proxy for identifying how many hydrogen molecules are in a given area.

Researchers have been using this method for measuring hydrogen molecules for 50 years, Ginsburg said.

But they’ve always assumed the carbon monoxide was gas — not solid ice, as the Webb data revealed. This finding opens a whole new can of worms, Ginsburg said.

Ginsburg noted that it’s crucial for researchers to understand what state of matter the carbon monoxide is in — gas or solid — to arrive at the right answers.

Every new piece of knowledge about the Brick and its makeup better informs why this opaque cloud isn’t producing stars, even though — by most accounts — it should be one of the most active star nurseries in the galaxy.

“It’s a really natural place for new stars,” Ginsburg said. “But we haven’t found very many — only a very, very tiny handful.”

There are some possible answers that Ginsburg and other researchers are anxious to explore: Perhaps the Brick is more spread out — less compact — than scientists once thought. Or maybe it’s just too young, and its star-forming days are ahead.

Those are questions, Ginsburg and Butterfield said, that Webb can continue to help researchers answer.

“It’s just an impressive, impressive telescope,” Butterfield said. “I think this is just the first of many unique results that will be coming out of the JWST for the galactic center.”","['galaxy', 'mysteries', 'center', 'webb', 'carbon', 'unlock', 'unexpected', 'researchers', 'stars', 'monoxide', 'ice', 'brick', 'telescope', 'scientists', 'ginsburg', 'help', 'finding']","It’s also littered with frozen carbon monoxide — much more than previously expected — according to a study published Monday in The Astrophysical Journal.

271,Scientists reveal new insights into mysterious baboon mummies of ancient Egypt,"CNN —

To date, tens of millions of animal mummies have been unearthed in Egypt. But while there are millions of mummified cats, dogs, ibises and birds of prey, primate mummies are rare — and little understood.

Now, new analysis of mummified baboons is shedding light on the animals’ place in ancient Egypt, revealing that, while they were prized as sacred animals, their living conditions were less than ideal.

Researchers analyzed bones from mummified baboons, which were discovered in the early 1900s in the necropolis Gabbanat el-Qurud, in the so-called Valley of the Monkeys, to the southwest of Egypt’s Valley of the Kings. The bones represented dozens of individual baboons — from infants to adults — in two species: the hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas) and the olive baboon (Papio anubis).

These species weren’t native to Egypt — they were imported from two regions: “the olive baboon from the south (present-day Sudan), and the hamadryas baboon from mountainous areas bordering the Red Sea, in Sudan and southwards to Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia,” said lead study author Wim Van Neer, a professor emeritus at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels. “The exact provenances still need to be documented in more detail,” Van Neer told CNN in an email.

Of all the animals that the ancient Egyptians venerated, baboons were the only ones not native to Egypt, Van Neer added.

The baboons are thought to have played a role in ancient Egyptian rituals, the scientists reported Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. But raising and caring for large wild animals — particularly non-native species — is challenging. Before their deaths the baboons were sunlight-deprived and developed bone ailments from poor nutrition, researchers discovered. Examination of the skeletal remains revealed signs of rickets; the baboons had deformed arms, legs and faces, undeveloped teeth, osteoarthritis and other pathologies due to deprivation and metabolic disease.

Their deformities resembled those seen in the bones of baboons from two other ancient Egyptian sites — Saqqara and Tuna el-Gebel — dating to around the same period, the authors wrote.

“This excellently crafted and executed study confirms the results of some earlier investigations concerning the health status of baboons in ancient Egypt,” said Dr. Salima Ikram, a Distinguished University Professor of Egyptology from the American University of Cairo, who was not involved in the research. “More importantly, it also establishes the fact that different types of baboons were being brought to and reared in Egypt,” Ikram told CNN in an email. “It is fascinating to think that the ancient Egyptians tried to institute a breeding programme for baboons so that they could both be revered as well as used in religious rituals.”

A jumble of bones

At the three main Egyptian sites where mummies of Old World monkeys were interred, 463 mummified primates have been discovered, according to the study. The baboon bones examined for the new analysis were collected in 1905 and 1906 by archaeologists from the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle de Lyon in France (now the Musée des Confluences).

In the tombs were pieces of dried skin with long tufts of hair still attached, suggesting that the animals had been placed there as mummies. The French archaeologists recovered 23 skulls, 24 mandibles and more than 200 isolated bones, which were assembled into complete skeletons regardless of whether all the bones belonged to the same baboon, according to the study.

Two skeletons had been cobbled together from bones belonging to two different baboons, and one skeleton represented three of the primates. Of the four skeletons that were properly put together, only one had the correct skull. After analyzing the bones one by one, the study authors identified 36 different baboons of all ages, a set with more adults than juveniles and a few more males than females.

The bones also revealed signs of metabolic problems during adolescent growth, including curved shafts, misshapen shaft heads and arthritic joints. Two female baboons had suffered from tooth decay. There were lesions in some of the skulls; two of the primates had shortened snouts, and two others had snouts that bent to the left.

The mummies were also centuries older than previously thought. Based on the mummies’ proximity to nearby ceramic artifacts in the tombs, earlier estimates placed them between the first and second centuries at the earliest, and possibly as recent as the seventh century.

But when the study authors examined bone collagen and fibers from a textile that had been wrapped around an intact baboon mummy, they found that the animals were likely entombed between 803 and 520 BC. The researchers confirmed that time frame using a technique called radiocarbon dating, which can determine the age of organic material by measuring the amount of decay in a radioactive isotope of carbon.

Sacred and suffering

Conditions for the captive primates may have been even worse than their remains suggested, as bones often don’t preserve records of parasites and other types of ailments, the researchers reported.

However, it’s important to note the scientists’ findings don’t suggest that the baboons were being intentionally abused. Their keepers likely did the best that they could to care for the animals, “but this must not have been easy,” Van Neer said.

“Baboons are good climbers and they were therefore probably kept in buildings or enclosures with high walls to prevent them from escaping.

272,Superbug crisis: How a woman saved her husband's life,"CNN —

In February 2016, infectious disease epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee was holding her dying husband’s hand, watching him lose an exhausting fight against a deadly superbug infection.

After months of ups and downs, doctors had just told her that her husband, Tom Patterson, was too racked with bacteria to live.

“I told him, ‘Honey, we’re running out of time. I need to know if you want to live. I don’t even know if you can hear me, but if you can hear me and you want to live, please squeeze my hand.’

“All of a sudden, he squeezed really hard. And I thought, ‘Oh, great!’ And then I’m thinking, ‘Oh, crap! What am I going to do?’”

Strathdee would place cool cloths on her husband's forehead during his extended illness to try to break his many fevers. Steffanie Strathdee

What she accomplished next could easily be called miraculous. First, Strathdee found an obscure treatment that offered a glimmer of hope — fighting superbugs with phages, viruses created by nature to eat bacteria.

Then she convinced phage scientists around the country to hunt and peck through molecular haystacks of sewage, bogs, ponds, the bilge of boats and other prime breeding grounds for bacteria and their viral opponents. The impossible goal: quickly find the few, exquisitely unique phages capable of fighting a specific strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria literally eating her husband alive.

Next, the US Food and Drug Administration had to greenlight this unproven cocktail of hope, and scientists had to purify the mixture so that it wouldn’t be deadly.

Yet just three weeks later, Strathdee watched doctors intravenously inject the mixture into her husband’s body — and save his life.

Their story is one of unrelenting perseverance and unbelievable good fortune. It’s a glowing tribute to the immense kindness of strangers. And it’s a story that just might save countless lives from the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant superbugs — maybe even your own.

“It’s estimated that by 2050, 10 million people per year — that’s one person every three seconds — is going to be dying from a superbug infection,” Strathdee told an audience at Life Itself, a 2022 health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN.

“I’m here to tell you that the enemy of my enemy can be my friend. Viruses can be medicine.”

A terrifying vacation

During a Thanksgiving cruise on the Nile in 2015, Patterson was suddenly felled by severe stomach cramps. When a clinic in Egypt failed to help his worsening symptoms, Patterson was flown to Germany, where doctors discovered a grapefruit-size abdominal abscess filled with Acinetobacter baumannii, a virulent bacterium resistant to nearly all antibiotics.

Found in the sands of the Middle East, the bacteria were blown into the wounds of American troops hit by roadside bombs during the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname “Iraqibacter.”

“Veterans would get shrapnel in their legs and bodies from IED explosions and were medevaced home to convalesce,” Strathdee told CNN, referring to improvised explosive devices. “Unfortunately, they brought their superbug with them. Sadly, many of them survived the bomb blasts but died from this deadly bacterium.”

Today, Acinetobacter baumannii tops the World Health Organization’s list of dangerous pathogens for which new antibiotics are critically needed.

“It’s something of a bacterial kleptomaniac. It’s really good at stealing antimicrobial resistance genes from other bacteria,” Strathdee said. “I started to realize that my husband was a lot sicker than I thought and that modern medicine had run out of antibiotics to treat him.”

With the bacteria growing unchecked inside him, Patterson was soon medevaced to the couple’s hometown of San Diego, where he was a professor of psychiatry and Strathdee was the associate dean of global health sciences at the University of California, San Diego.

“Tom was on a roller coaster — he’d get better for a few days, and then there would be a deterioration, and he would be very ill,” said Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, a leading infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who was a longtime friend and colleague. As weeks turned into months, “Tom began developing multi-organ failure. He was sick enough that we could lose him any day.”

Searching for a needle in a haystack

After that reassuring hand squeeze from her husband, Strathdee sprang into action. Scouring the internet, she had already stumbled across a study by a Tbilisi, Georgia, researcher on the use of phages for treatment of drug-resistant bacteria.

A phone call later, Strathdee discovered phage treatment was well established in former Soviet bloc countries but had been discounted long ago as “fringe science” in the West.

“Phages are everywhere. There’s 10 million trillion trillion — that’s 10 to the power of 31 — phages that are thought to be on the planet,” Strathdee said. “They’re in soil, they’re in water, in our oceans and in our bodies, where they are the gatekeepers that keep our bacterial numbers in check. But you have to find the right phage to kill the bacterium that is causing the trouble.”

Buoyed by her newfound knowledge, Strathdee began reaching out to scientists who worked with phages: “I wrote cold emails to total strangers, begging them for help,” she said at Life Itself.

One stranger who quickly answered was Texas A&M University biochemist Ryland Young. He’d been working with phages for over 45 years.

“You know the word persuasive? There’s nobody as persuasive as Steffanie,” said Young, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics who runs the lab at the university’s Center for Phage Technology. “We just dropped everything. No exaggeration, people were literally working 24/7, screening 100 different environmental samples to find just a couple of new phages.”

‘No problem’

While the Texas lab burned the midnight oil, Schooley tried to obtain FDA approval for the injection of the phage cocktail into Patterson. Because phage therapy has not undergone clinical trials in the United States, each case of “compassionate use” required a good deal of documentation. It’s a process that can consume precious time.

But the woman who answered the phone at the FDA said, “‘No problem. This is what you need, and we can arrange that,’” Schooley recalled. “And then she tells me she has friends in the Navy that might be able to find some phages for us as well.”

In fact, the US Naval Medical Research Center had banks of phages gathered from seaports around the world. Scientists there began to hunt for a match, “and it wasn’t long before they found a few phages that appeared to be active against the bacterium,” Strathdee said.

Back in Texas, Young and his team had also gotten lucky. They found four promising phages that ravaged Patterson’s antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a test tube. Now the hard part began — figuring out how to separate the victorious phages from the soup of bacterial toxins left behind.

“You put one virus particle into a culture, you go home for lunch, and if you’re lucky, you come back to a big shaking, liquid mess of dead bacteria parts among billions and billions of the virus,” Young said. “You want to inject those virus particles into the human bloodstream, but you’re starting with bacterial goo that’s just horrible. You would not want that injected into your body.”

Purifying phage to be given intravenously was a process that no one had yet perfected in the US, Schooley said, “but both the Navy and Texas A&M got busy, and using different approaches figured out how to clean the phages to the point they could be given safely.”

More hurdles: Legal staff at Texas A&M expressed concern about future lawsuits. “I remember the lawyer saying to me, ‘Let me see if I get this straight. You want to send unapproved viruses from this lab to be injected into a person who will probably die.’ And I said, “Yeah, that’s about it,’” Young said.

“But Stephanie literally had speed dial numbers for the chancellor and all the people involved in human experimentation at UC San Diego. After she calls them, they basically called their counterparts at A&M, and suddenly they all began to work together,” Young added.

“It was like the parting of the Red Sea — all the paperwork and hesitation disappeared.”

‘It was just miraculous’

The purified cocktail from Young’s lab was the first to arrive in San Diego. Strathdee watched as doctors injected the Texas phages into the pus-filled abscesses in Patterson’s abdomen before settling down for the agonizing wait.

“We started with the abscesses because we didn’t know what would happen, and we didn’t want to kill him,” Schooley said. “We didn’t see any negative side effects; in fact, Tom seemed to be stabilizing a bit, so we continued the therapy every two hours.”

Two days later, the Navy cocktail arrived. Those phages were injected into Patterson’s bloodstream to tackle the bacteria that had spread to the rest of his body.

“We believe Tom was the first person to receive intravenous phage therapy to treat a systemic superbug infection in the US,” Strathdee told CNN.

“And three days later, Tom lifted his head off the pillow out of a deep coma and kissed his daughter’s hand. It was just miraculous.”

Damaged but not broken

Today, nearly eight years later, Patterson is happily retired, walking 3 miles a day and gardening. But the long illness took its toll: He was diagnosed with diabetes and is now insulin dependent, with mild heart damage and gastrointestinal issues that affect his diet.

“He isn’t back surfing again, because he can’t feel the bottoms of his feet, and he did get Covid-19 in April that landed him in the hospital because the bottoms of his lungs are essentially dead,” Strathdee said.

“As soon as the infection hit his lungs he couldn’t breathe and I had to rush him to the hospital, so that was scary,” she said. “He remains high risk for Covid but we’re not letting that hold us hostage at home. He says, ‘I want to go back to having as normal life as fast as possible.’”

To prove it, the couple are again traveling the world — they recently returned from a 12-day trip to Argentina.

“We traveled with a friend who is an infectious disease doctor, which gave me peace of mind to know that if anything went sideways, we’d have an expert at hand,” Strathdee said.

“I guess I’m a bit of a helicopter wife in that sense. Still, we’ve traveled to Costa Rica a couple of times, we’ve been to Africa, and we’re planning to go to Chile in January.”

A legacy

Patterson’s case was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in 2017, jump-starting new scientific interest in phage therapy.

“There’s been an explosion of clinical trials that are going on now in phage (science) around the world and there’s phage programs in Canada, the UK, Australia, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, India and China has a new one, so it’s really catching on,” Strathdee told CNN.

Some of the work is focused on the interplay between phages and antibiotics — as bacteria battle phages they often shed their outer shell to keep the enemy from docking and gaining access for the kill. When that happens, the bacteria may be suddenly vulnerable to antibiotics again.

“We don’t think phages are ever going to entirely replace antibiotics, but they will be a good adjunct to antibiotics. And in fact, they can even make antibiotics work better,” Strathdee said.

In San Diego, Strathdee and Schooley opened the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, or IPATH, in 2018, where they treat or counsel patients suffering from multidrug-resistant infections. The center’s success rate is high, with 82% of patients undergoing phage therapy experiencing a clinically successful outcome, according to its website.

Schooley is running a clinical trial using phages to treat patients with cystic fibrosis who constantly battle Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a drug-resistant bacteria that was also responsible for the recent illness and deaths connected to contaminated eye drops manufactured in India.

And a memoir the couple published in 2019 — “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug” — is also spreading the word about these “perfect predators” to what may soon be the next generation of phage hunters.

“I am getting increasingly contacted by students, some as young as 12,” Strathdee said. “There’s a girl in San Francisco who begged her mother to read this book and now she’s doing a science project on phage-antibiotic synergy, and she’s in eighth grade. That thrills me.”

Strathdee is quick to acknowledge the many people who helped save her husband’s life. But those who were along for the ride told CNN that she and Patterson made the difference.

“I think it was a historical accident that could have only happened to Steffanie and Tom,” Young said. “They were at UC San Diego, which is one of the premier universities in the country. They worked with a brilliant infectious disease doctor who said, ‘Yes,’ to phage therapy when most physicians would’ve said, ‘Hell, no, I won’t do that.’

“And then there is Steffanie’s passion and energy — it’s hard to explain until she’s focused it on you. It was like a spiderweb; she was in the middle and pulled on strings,” Young added. “It was just meant to be because of her, I think.”","['phages', 'saved', 'bacteria', 'patterson', 'young', 'life', 'schooley', 'woman', 'superbug', 'strathdee', 'phage', 'san', 'told', 'diego', 'crisis', 'husbands']","Yet just three weeks later, Strathdee watched doctors intravenously inject the mixture into her husband’s body — and save his life.

273,"Who came out on top, and who lost out from the OpenAI leadership crisis?","CNN —

The leadership crisis that engulfed OpenAI for nearly a week ended almost as abruptly as it began: With a terse, cryptic announcement by the company that would have enormous ramifications for its future.

In some ways, the outcome was a return to the status quo: Sam Altman would be restored as CEO, with the company’s deep and lucrative business partnership with Microsoft, which took a $13 billion stake in the company even as it ramps up its own AI research efforts, left intact.

But in other ways, the agreement is still a watershed moment for OpenAI and the artificial intelligence field writ large.

The tumultuous week seems to have resulted in a big victory for Altman personally; proponents of widespread AI adoption; and some of the country’s most established elites. And it came at the expense of AI skeptics who, by many accounts, bungled an attempt to make a principled stand for caution about the technology’s long-term risks.

Who came out on top

Sam Altman A clear winner in the whole debacle is, of course, Altman himself. Unceremoniously ejected from his post on Friday, Altman quickly rallied support from the vast majority of OpenAI’s staff, who signed what was essentially a loyalty pledge underscoring the deep rift between himself and the board. His return to OpenAI, in triumph over the board that summarily fired him, reflects a kind of personal vindication that’s only likely to bolster, for better or for worse, his carefully and intentionally constructed image as a charismatic visionary who is single-handedly unlocking the secrets of the universe.

Microsoft Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has sought to downplay the tech giant’s part in the crisis, insisting on Monday — before Altman’s reappointment — that whatever happens with OpenAI, “nothing changes.” Microsoft’s priority, Nadella said, was to ensure uninterrupted delivery of AI technology to its own customers, whether that meant Altman being hired by Microsoft or his reinstallation at OpenAI.

But Microsoft is hardly a disinterested party, having committed billions to OpenAI in a multi-year partnership that’s led to the tech giant integrating ChatGPT into Bing search and other Microsoft products. Now, Microsoft is poised to gain even more influence. Nadella hinted at this reality on Monday, signaling that if Altman were to return as OpenAI’s CEO, Microsoft would have a very strong opinion on how the AI startup is governed.

“One thing I’ll be very, very clear [about] is, we’re never going to get back into a situation where we get surprised like this ever again,” Nadella said. “If we go back to operating like on Friday, we will make sure we are very, very clear that the governance gets fixed in a way that we really have more surety and guarantee that we don’t have surprises.”

Whether that could mean having a board observer or a full-fledged seat on OpenAI’s board, he said, is a bridge “we’ll cross… if it happens.”

New board members In naming ex-Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to OpenAI’s board, the agreement stands to align the company even more closely with the country’s wealthiest and most influential elite.

Taylor isn’t just a former CEO of one of the tech industry’s biggest companies. He’s a former chief technology officer of Facebook, and in 2022, as the chair of Twitter, successfully forced Elon Musk to follow through with his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company, in a momentous bit of corporate maneuvering.

Summers, meanwhile, is the former president of Harvard University who has attracted controversy for suggesting that “innate differences” are the reason for women’s underrepresentation in scientific professions. The remark was widely criticized as sexist and Summers subsequently apologized.

Who came out on bottom

The push to slow AI development In the same way that the deal breathes new life into Altman’s mythos, so does it give a tailwind to the ideology he represents: a belief in the rapid commercialization of generative AI. With some of the apparent architects of Altman’s ouster being pushed out themselves, a casualty of the affair may be the perspectives that those board members espoused. That seems to include a deep fear about the long-term, potentially even existential risks of AI.

In the letter signed by hundreds of OpenAI staffers threatening to quit, employees reported that board members claimed allowing the company to be destroyed “would be consistent with the mission” of OpenAI, which is to “ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”

That OpenAI’s board apparently believed the company’s destruction would benefit society reflects the concerns of a vocal camp in the AI field that has called for pauses in AI development, more research to “align” AI with human-centered values, and concerns about the unchecked power of a truly sentient super-intelligence. Emmett Shear, whom the board named OpenAI’s interim CEO for all of two days, has also expressed similar worries. In the fallout of the leadership crisis, some have argued that the outcome is also a defeat for effective altruism, the movement with which some OpenAI board members are said to be affiliated.

OpenAI does not appear to be on the brink of an all-out AI sprint that disregards risk entirely. Summers has been vocal about AI’s near-term impacts on labor. And after having wowed US lawmakers by calling for AI regulation, Altman will likely continue to be a prominent figure in the global debate over rules for artificial intelligence.

Still, deserved or not, the dispute appears to have done long-term damage to the credibility of certain deep skeptics of AI, and lifted the fortunes of the Microsofts and Altmans of the world who are pushing to get artificial intelligence into the hands of the public. And that may have untold ripple effects for AI development for years to come.","['altman', 'openai', 'board', 'microsoft', 'ceo', 'openais', 'came', 'company', 'summers', 'ai', 'nadella', 'leadership', 'crisis', 'lost']","CNN —The leadership crisis that engulfed OpenAI for nearly a week ended almost as abruptly as it began: With a terse, cryptic announcement by the company that would have enormous ramifications for its future.

274,Democrats accuse X of profiting from Hamas propaganda,"Washington CNN —

A group of House Democrats has accused X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, of profiting from Hamas propaganda and misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war after reports by independent researchers found numerous accounts glorifying the US-sanctioned terror group.

More than two dozen US lawmakers signed the letter dated Tuesday addressed to X owner Elon Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino.

Citing analyses by groups including the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, NewsGuard and the Tech Transparency Project, Tuesday’s letter said lawmakers were “outraged by the clear indicators that X is profiting from the spread of Hamas’s terrorist propaganda — both through monthly subscription fees collected from some propaganda spreaders, and through ads displayed in replies to posts by both Premium and regular accounts.”

One of the reports in question, published last month, claimed to have identified examples of paid X subscribers sharing videos bearing Hamas iconography and depicting violent or gruesome images. Another report claimed to have identified dozens of paid X subscriber accounts promoting “false or unsubstantiated narratives relating to the war” and that posts spreading the misinformation had been viewed at least 100 million times globally.

“Given X’s major cuts to content moderation staff over the last year, it appears that X has willfully permitted, and benefited from, the illegal spread of terrorist propaganda,” wrote the group, led by Reps. Adam Schiff of California, Daniel Goldman of New York and Jamie Raskin of Maryland. “Such behavior from one of the world’s most widely used social media platforms is wholly unacceptable.”

X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawmakers’ accusations.

A new report released by NewsGuard on Wednesday claimed that ads for 86 major advertisers, including Pizza Hut, Airbnb and Microsoft, were shown on viral posts that pushed false or misleading claims about the Israel-Hamas war. The posts were seen by a total of 92 million users on X, according to NewsGuard.

X released a statement in advance of the NewsGuard report’s publication, calling its findings into question. X could not be reached for further comment Wednesday evening.

On Tuesday, Musk abruptly announced that X would be donating “all revenue from advertising & subscriptions associated with the war in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza.” But it was unclear what content he was referring to and whether the announcement was directly related to the lawmakers’ letter. X Head of Business Operations Joe Benarroch declined to clarify the company’s plans beyond saying the donation would be “a sizeable amount.”

The pressure from House Democrats comes amid a wider blowback to X over extremist content on the platform, in some cases amplified directly by Musk himself. In recent days, X has suffered a notable exodus of high-profile advertisers following Musk’s public embrace of an antisemitic conspiracy theory popular with White supremacists and a report by Media Matters, the progressive media watchdog group, that said major brands’ advertisements appeared beside pro-Nazi content.

Musk sued Media Matters on Monday, accusing it of distorting the likelihood that ads may be shown against extremist material. But some legal critics have cast doubt on the complaint, calling it “weak” and “bogus” in the face of the First Amendment.

Tuesday’s letter also highlights the mounting public scrutiny of Yaccarino, who until now has sought to position herself as a cheery counterweight to Musk’s flirtation with far-right extremism. The letter calls for Yaccarino and Musk to answer by December 1 to allegations that X has amplified terrorist propaganda in violation of its own policies.

It comes a day after the Senate Judiciary Committee said it had enlisted the US Marshals Service, in a rare move, to serve Yaccarino with a subpoena personally, compelling her to testify at a December 6 hearing on children’s online safety. In a release, the committee said it was forced to take that extraordinary measure after X declined to accept the subpoena on Yaccarino’s behalf, in a “remarkable departure from typical practice.”","['hamas', 'terrorist', 'media', 'letter', 'posts', 'musk', 'yaccarino', 'democrats', 'lawmakers', 'propaganda', 'x', 'war', 'profiting', 'accuse']","Washington CNN —A group of House Democrats has accused X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, of profiting from Hamas propaganda and misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war after reports by independent researchers found numerous accounts glorifying the US-sanctioned terror group.

275,"Spotify to slash royalties for rain sounds, white noise and other non-music tracks","CNN —

Spotify’s new royalty system means so-called functional noises like the sound of rainfall will earn significantly less than traditional music files.

In an attempt to crack down on “bad actors” using the genre to fraudulently generate revenue, Spotify announced in a blog post Tuesday it would be increasing the minimum track length for functional noise recordings to two minutes, as well as valuing streams of the sounds at a “fraction of the value” of music track streams.

A sound featuring 30 seconds of white noise has thus far been worth the same as an artist’s original music track, creating a “revenue opportunity for noise uploaders well beyond their contribution to listeners,” according to Spotify, and creating frustration throughout the music industry.

Until now, creators of functional sounds have been able to game Spotify’s streaming system to maximize revenue with minimal effort. Since streaming royalties are paid out partly based on the amount of times a track is played and sounds like white noise are often listened to for hours, Spotify says creators are shortening sounds to as little as 30 seconds (the platform’s current minimum track length) and looping playlists so that the same clip gets listened to over and over again, bumping up streaming numbers and royalty cash outs.

While Spotify did not state how much the platform would be devaluing the streams, Billboard reported that functional tracks would now be worth one-fifth of their music counterparts.

The functional genre includes nature sounds, white noise, sound effects and silence recordings.

“It can’t be that an Ed Sheeran stream is worth exactly the same as a stream of rain falling on the roof,” Robert Kync, Warner Music Group CEO, said in a May earnings call, a sentiment echoed by other music executives.

“Obviously white noise is very different from ‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ but it, currently under this model, is paid the same,” Marina Guz, chief commercial officer at Endel, an AI-driven functional music company partnered with Universal Music Group, told CNN.

Guz explained that there has been rising pressure from labels and artists to change the way Spotify makes distinctions between functional noise and music.

“There’s been an ongoing conversation this entire year of the value of music and how something like someone just putting up white noise is different than paying for an artist that had spent a year in the studio making the album with all kinds of instruments and people involved,” Guz told CNN.

In another attempt to clamp down on malicious behavior, the platform announced Tuesday it is moving to charge labels and distributors by track when “flagrant” artificial streaming is suspected. Artificial streaming is when streams counts are increased fraudulently, such as through bots. The company is also making changes to its royalty system, moving to only compensate tracks that generate more than 1000 streams.

Spotify has also come under scrutiny for white noise podcasts, with Bloomberg reporting in 2023 that podcasts featuring only ambient sounds were accounting for three million daily consumption hours and accidentally being boosted by Spotify’s own algorithm, resulting in a $38 million loss in potential annual profits. Creators of such podcasts could reportedly rake in as much as $18,000 a month in ads, Bloomberg found in 2022.

276,Jack Ma backs off on plans to sell Alibaba shares after stock plunge,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

Jack Ma has put off plans to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Alibaba shares after the Chinese tech giant’s stock plummeted last week.

Two regulatory filings from last Thursday revealed that Ma had been looking to offload 10 million shares, worth nearly $871 million.

But because the company’s stock price has fallen below the billionaire’s expectations, he has not sold “a single share,” according to a Wednesday post from Alibaba (BABA) Chief People Officer Jane Jiang Fang on the company’s internal forum seen by CNN.

The sales were initially planned to take place this Tuesday through JC Properties and JSP Investment, two entities linked to Ma and his philanthropic foundation, according to the filings.

The disclosure of the intended sales came the same day Alibaba reported third quarter earnings, when it announced that it would drop plans to spin off its cloud computing arm partly due to uncertainties caused by US controls on chip exports to China.

Alibaba’s stock plunged 9% in New York on Thursday and nearly 10% in Hong Kong on Friday, wiping out about $20 billion from the company’s market value.

So far this year, Alibaba’s shares have fallen more than 10%.

Jiang said the fact that both pieces of news came at the same time was just a “coincidence.”

The news of the sale had triggered rumors that Ma had lost confidence in the company, but Jiang urged employees to dismiss such speculation. The executive said the transactions were part of a long-term plan laid out in August, which would allow Ma’s office to invest in agricultural technology and welfare projects both in and outside China.

Ma believes that the Hangzhou-based firm’s stock “is currently significantly lower than Alibaba’s actual value, and he will not sell it,” she said.

Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai also weighed in, writing in a comment on the same post seen by CNN that he had “full confidence” in the company.

On Friday, Ma’s office told the South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong newspaper owned by Alibaba, that he remained “very positive” about the company’s prospects, despite plans for “a partial sell-down.”

Ma’s foundation and Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the matter, or whether the share sale would proceed if the company’s stock price rebounded.

The group is currently in the midst of a major restructuring, which was announced in March and originally intended to result in a split of six separate units, each overseen by its own chief executive and board of directors.

But last week, Alibaba said it would rethink plans not just for its cloud business, but for a listing of its grocery chain Freshippo, citing a need to “evaluate market conditions.”

Ma founded Alibaba in 1999. He stepped down as chairman of the company in 2019, about a year before landing in hot water with Chinese authorities for criticizing Chinese financial regulators and banks. Since then, the entrepreneur has kept a relatively low profile while remaining an Alibaba shareholder.","['kong', 'plans', 'shares', 'backs', 'companys', 'stock', 'chinese', 'post', 'jack', 'ma', 'worth', 'alibaba', 'sell', 'plunge']","Hong Kong CNN —Jack Ma has put off plans to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Alibaba shares after the Chinese tech giant’s stock plummeted last week.

277,Solid state batteries promise to radically change EVs. But they may not be the only answer,"CNN —

Electric cars are supposed to be the future, but they still have issues that are keeping away many car buyers. The range is too short. The batteries are too heavy and expensive. They take too long to charge. But a number of companies say they have the technology to solve many — maybe even all — of these problems.

Toyota, in particular, has said it might be on the cusp of such a breakthrough. Other automakers are also working with various battery companies on versions of this new technology.

The would-be breakthrough is called a “solid state battery,” and the only problem is that — much like other vaunted Earth-changing technologies — for a few years now, it’s always been just a couple of years away.

Car companies including Stellantis, Hyundai and Volkswagen have also teamed up with firms working on solid state batteries. The technology holds the promise of batteries that are smaller and lighter while providing more power. They could be safer with less chance of catching fire in a crash, too.

But solid state technology has its own challenges, and it’s not the only way automakers could achieve lighter, cheaper and faster charging electric vehicles.

Battery basics

The main difference between a solid state battery and the lithium-ion batteries currently used in electric cars is a component known as the electrolyte. In a lithium-ion battery, the electrolyte is a gooey liquid. In a solid state battery, the electrolyte is, well, a solid. That solid electrolyte is one reason that solid state batteries might be safer than lithium-ion batteries. If a liquid electrolyte battery is broken or punctured, the two sides of the electrolyte can ooze together, which can lead to an uncontrolled energy flow, followed by a fire.

Generally speaking, solids are also denser than liquids meaning the electrolyte takes up less space and battery cells can be smaller. But some companies are working on other strategies, as well, that can make batteries still smaller and lighter and, also, faster charging.

The main challenge for all of these companies, and the automakers that have invested in them, is how to produce these hi-tech batteries economically in the sort of numbers needed to build affordable electric cars. Meanwhile, there are competing battery technologies for which manufacturing techniques are well established.

It’s a wide-open field right now with a number of start-up companies each working with different chemical combinations and even slightly different physical structures for their batteries. There’s still no clearly superior technology, said William Kephart, a battery researcher at the consulting firm P3 Group

Fast charging times, a key consumer demand, is one challenge for solid-state batteries. Generally, it takes the lithium ions in the batteries used currently more time to move through a rigid material than a liquid, Kephart said. That tends to make it take longer to receive energy, which slows charging times, and makes it slower to release energy — which drags on a vehicle’s acceleration.

Solid-state battery company Quantumscape claims that its solid-state batteries — which use some liquid, but not for the electrolyte — have been tested and can charge even faster than typical lithium ion batteries.

Solid-state batteries will tend to be more expensive because they contain more lithium, which is expensive, said Kephart. Lithium prices will come down as more sources are found and accessed, he said, but, compared to other batteries, solid-state batteries will tend to cost more.

A company called Factorial, which counts Stellantis and Mercedes as investors, claims its solid-state battery technology uses less lithium than traditional batteries, which could potentially reduce costs, especially as production ramps up.

“We think the costing actually will be competitive because lithium, just from the raw material perspective, it’s not a scarce material,” said Factorial chief executive Siyu Huang.

Quantumscape also say its battery design eliminates graphite, reducing expense and, the company claims, greatly reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing.

Other options

At the same time, though, some other battery companies are working to improve traditional liquid-electrolyte batteries, improvements that could make that existing technology better. Just changing the one piece of the battery by adding silicone could yield big improvements in performance at relatively low cost. That’s what’s proposed by a company called OneD Battery Sciences, in which GM has invested.

OneD’s technology allows production processes to stay roughly the same while promising big improvements in performance, according to the company. That means less trouble and expense for battery manufacturers and automakers.

Other companies are working on semi-solid state batteries that combine parts of each type of battery, providing some of the benefits of solid state without completely ditching the standard fluid-based design.

Ultimately, there probably will never be one battery technology used in all EVs, GM spokesperson Phil Lienert said. The type of batteries will be matched to the vehicle and the specific market where it’s sold. It’s similar to how automakers use different engines in various models and in different markets. GM’s Ultium electric vehicle design, which underlies all of GM’s EV models, was specifically engineered to enable the use of all different sorts of batteries.

“When you have a customer lineup as big and diverse as ours, you need to have multiple solutions that can coexist” within the same basic engineering, he said.","['batteries', 'electrolyte', 'solid', 'working', 'electric', 'technology', 'radically', 'promise', 'battery', 'lithium', 'answer', 'change', 'companies', 'state', 'evs']","Car companies including Stellantis, Hyundai and Volkswagen have also teamed up with firms working on solid state batteries.

278,Brands that have paused ads on X amid ongoing crisis for Elon Musk’s platform,"New York CNN —

At least a dozen major brands have halted ad spending on X, formerly Twitter, since its latest advertiser exodus began last week over concerns about antisemitism and hate speech on Elon Musk’s social media platform.

Fox Sports, Ubisoft, Axios, TechCrunch and Paris Hilton’s 11:11 Media all told CNN in recent days that they’d paused their ad spending on X, joining other large advertisers that jumped ship last week.

The ongoing exit of advertisers marks a deepening crisis for X, which was already struggling to woo brands back to the platform following Musk’s takeover last year. And it comes as growing numbers of X users also decamp to alternate platforms. The White House joined Threads this week, giving a boost to Meta’s X competitor.

The latest revolt began last week when IBM said it had suspended advertising on X after a report from progressive media watchdog Media Matters found its ad had run alongside pro-Nazi content on the platform. IBM’s decision also came after Musk had publicly endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory in a post on X earlier in the week.

On Friday, a slew of major media brands including Disney, Paramount, Comcast, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal and CNN-parent Warner Bros. Discovery followed suit, although they did not specify their reasons for halting advertising on X. Apple also reportedly pulled its ad spend on X as of last week, according to reports from multiple news outlets.

X has called on its advertising partners to help protect what it calls “freedom of speech.” The company on Monday filed a lawsuit accusing Media Matters of misrepresenting how likely it is for ads to run alongside extremist content on the site. X also said it had made the pro-Nazi accounts identified by Media Matters ineligible for monetization, meaning ads can no longer be run on their pages. And CEO Linda Yaccarino has continued to tout brand safety controls that the company says can help prevent ads from running beside objectionable content. (Media Matters has vowed to fight the lawsuit from X and says it stands by its reporting.)

But the company has done little else to reassure advertisers that its platform is safe. The pro-Nazi accounts identified by Media Matters remain active on the site, along with other far-right and White supremacist accounts, some of whom Musk had reinstated on the platform following his takeover. CNN on Wednesday observed ads for the University of Michigan running on the page of the X account belonging to Richard Spencer, a known White nationalist. (A University of Michigan spokesperson told CNN the university is “watching developments on X closely as we continue to evaluate our use of the platform.”)

Musk this week also boosted the years-old, debunked “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory that in 2016 prompted a gun-wielding man to fire shots inside a Washington, D.C., pizza shop.

Some advertisers have remained on X despite the hate speech concerns. The National Football League — one of the platform’s biggest ad partners — told CNN Tuesday that it had repeatedly expressed concerns about hate speech to X leadership directly, although it has not pulled its spending from the platform.

279,"Michael Jordan’s ultra-private, ultra-exclusive personal golf course: The Grove XXIII","CNN —

There’s one small corner of the world that Michael Jordan cherishes more than any other — his own personal haven of sporting bliss.

But it’s not in Chicago. In fact, there isn’t a basketball court or hoop in sight.

Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts.

The Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it.

For Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.”

And there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994.

Almost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015.

With Tiger Woods headlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect.

A meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client.

“I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN.

“I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.”

The land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach.

Weed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week.

Weed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants. Watching Jordan in discussion with the team during one early meeting, he got the impression of a coach interacting with his players.

“I think one of his qualities is he was such a good listener, and he absorbed everything that you were discussing,” Weed said.

“He didn’t come out and say ‘do this or do that.’ He came out and observed and was a great listener, and he let me do my job.”

“Slaughterhouse 23”

Weed had his two pillars for a great golf course — an engaged owner and a good piece of property, though the latter would require some polishing.

Turning a flat, “featureless” site – bordered by two long drainage canals – into a cross between the manicured, parkland style of Augusta National and the rustic layout of Pine Valley represented the greatest challenge to him and his team.

Dirt was excavated from lagoons to build the course and its features, fixing the flatness issue and leaving behind six large lakes – the same number of NBA Championships Jordan won. It was a coincidence, but ultimately fit the theme of a course tuned to the finest degree to its owner’s style.

Jordan wanted firm and fast, a course that could both excite and challenge its members, many of whom would be among the PGA Tour’s current stars. A double-helix layout, with a “crossover” at the 5th and 14th holes, offers the flexibility to play continual internal circuits in three, six, or nine-hole loops – ideal for Jordan’s busy schedule.

The course didn’t just need to suit the playstyle of its owner, though, it needed to enhance it.

“You don’t think I’m going to spend this much money and not have a little bit of an advantage do you?” Weed recalled Jordan saying.

Add to that the five-time MVP’s penchant for wagers, which will be familiar to viewers of docuseries “The Last Dance,” and the course has earned a new name among some members: “Slaughterhouse 23.”

“It’s his golf course, so it’s set up very well for him,” former world No. 1 Rickie Fowler told the Subpar podcast in 2020.

Weed, too, got drawn into the wagers, even during construction.

“I can remember us being out there hitting shots and doing a little gambling while we were just playing in the dirt. It was just great fun and interaction,” he said.

“It’s hard not to go out there and play a round with MJ without having a friendly wager.”

To meet the second requirement of Jordan’s brief, Weed’s team set aside 20 acres to construct a state-of-the-art practice facility that the designer believes has no equal.

Two 400-yard, double-sided driving lanes can be maintained for specific conditions, such as US Open or PGA Tour style fairways, with “target greens” in 25-yard increments. Each green has built-in pods that can track swathes of shot information, incorporating the PGA Tour’s ShotLink data.

The putting green is split into four quadrants, with incremental slopes ranging from 0-1% to 3-4% inclines. Even the grass on the tees is customizable, with different types to mimic warm or cool seasons.

“It’s a Tour player’s haven to work on their game,” said Weed.

Taking a swing

Compared to Bobby Weed Golf Design, Nichols Architects had considerably less experience in golf courses, but it did have one key advantage in its efforts to beat other bids to build The Grove XXIII’s clubhouse.

Specializing in hospitality, residential, and commercial design, the firm had worked on the W South Beach in Miami — the favorite hotel of Jordan’s wife Yvette Prieto.

The team pulled no punches with its pitch to Jordan. “You’re not going to confuse this clubhouse with a clubhouse down the road or anything like that, and that’s what we’re selling you,” planning and design partner Igor Reyes told CNN of the pitching process, likening it to that depicted in the “Air” movie, where Nike must lure a rookie Jordan away from a deal with Adidas.

“You’ve really got to make an architectural iconic shape, and a shape that you could almost immediately feel was swinging across the landscape. Hopefully you can almost read the concept without anybody having to tell you,” Reyes said.

The deal clincher — outlined to Jordan in a pitch video — was that clubhouse shape, inspired by the smooth, “almost machine-like” perfection of a golf swing.

Reyes said his team had heard of Jordan’s purported early struggles with his swing, and, in the video, set up a column grid to map the building’s structure onto Tiger Woods’ club trajectory. Jordan was captivated, and told the firm there and then that it would get the contract.

“The first time you walk into the room with him, you don’t want to get too close or anything like that, it was kind of an odd thing,” Reyes said. “But by the second or third meeting we were just talking to him like a ‘regular’ client with a huge amount of respect.

“There was a really a sense of, ‘This isn’t just a guy with a lot of money that wants to do something. This guy knows what he’s doing, he knows what he likes, and how to get to it.’”

The elephant in the roof

Inside, 15,000 square feet of space leaves ample room for men’s and women’s lockers, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, kitchen and dining facilities, and even a shop. Hospitality was a priority, with a below-ground level meaning all service, as well as golf cart storage, can be managed from underneath.

Like the course, Jordan’s identity was stamped all over. Columns were set further inside below an overhanging roof to mimic the hang-time that inspired the “Air Jordan” tag, while an elephant print used on some of his shoes was incorporated into the fritted-glass roof, casting the print across the floor when the sun shines through.

Customization goes all the way down to Air Jordan logos on the ice cubes, as PGA Tour pro Jimmy Walker shared to Instagram after a round at the course in March 2021.

Like Weed, Reyes believes his job was made easier by an engaged client.

“He was involved with a lot of the decisions … we didn’t change a color without him knowing,” Reyes said.

“We have had work with other celebrity people and they won’t talk to you, it’s ‘I just want this’ and sort of like, ‘get out of the way.’ But he realized there was a lot of creativity going on and he wanted to be a part of it.”

“No other place I’d rather be”

Given Jordan’s regular on-site visits, there was no big reveal for the owner when the Grove XXIII officially opened in the fall of 2019, but there was a revelation when Weed joined him for his very first round.

When play finished, the architect found himself wrapped in a 6-foot, 6-inch bear hug.

“He looked at me and said, ‘I’m fortunate enough I can be anywhere in the world, but there’s no other place I’d rather be than right here,’” Weed recalled.

“That’s like the ultimate compliment … to have his own golf course and to shape and mold that golf course for him and his friends, it’s just where he wants to be. It’s just a great spot and evolved into something fantastic.

“He’s going to enjoy it as long as he’s playing and then it’s going to get passed along to the next generation — it’s just one of the great things about golf and why it has sustained itself over centuries.”","['bobby', 'weed', 'team', 'jordans', 'jordan', 'ultraexclusive', 'michael', 'xxiii', 'personal', 'shape', 'pga', 'course', 'design', 'ultraprivate', 'grove', 'golf']","Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course.

280,Six bull sharks inadvertently made their home on an Australian golf course. Then they vanished,"CNN —

For golfers, staying out of the water could be the difference between winning and losing. At one course in Australia, it was the difference between life and death.

Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks.

From their mysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard.

Arrival

A lake on a landlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats.

River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks have organs specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium.

Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s.

Neither did severe flooding.

Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions including in 1991, 1995 and 1996.

The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters.

As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013.

Carbrook’s Nessie

Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green.

There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast.

“The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN.

“It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.”

The presence of bull sharks (pictured, 2012) at Carbrook was something of an urban legend in the 1990s. Courtesy Scott Wagstaff

That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010.

Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat. No sooner had the bait hit the surface, a shark duly appeared.

The stunned Wagstaff snapped some shots before taking a short video on his phone to post online. The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: the viral YouTube video has amassed more than 2.3 million views to date.

Carbrook Golf Club Shark in the Lake

Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor.

A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls.

Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking.

Compared to the crocodiles and snakes dotting other courses in the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents. Only two risk-management steps were taken: warning signage around the lake, and the rejection of any business from prospective golf ball divers, who retrieve balls from course lakes to sell them on.

“It’s just not worth the few grand a year we get for a contract to put someone’s life at risk,” Wagstaff said.

Unprecedented

Fascination spread far beyond Australian borders, piquing the interest of one shark-loving scientist and researcher based at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany.

Dr. Peter Gausmann published his study on the Carbrook sharks, titled “Who’s the biggest fish in the pond?” in the Marine and Fishery Sciences journal in August 2023. Their extended residence, he argued, sheds new light on just how adaptable bull sharks are.

Even without the staff feeding the sharks, hunger was not a cause for concern in a lake 700 meters long, 380 meters wide and 15 meters deep, teeming with fish, from mullets to tarpons and snappers.

Gausmann calculated that the sharks would need to consume half a ton of fish per year – or 0.44% of their body weight per day – to meet their energy needs. Having been juveniles when they arrived, sightings verified they had grown to a healthy range of between 1.8 and 3 meters by 2013.

Only twice before had bull sharks been recorded surviving for years in isolated bodies of water, according to Gausmann, yet none had ever lasted so long.

One group made it at least four years in Panama’s freshwater Lake Bayano in the 1980s, while another survived a decade of high salinity in South Africa’s Lake St. Lucia after becoming trapped in 2002.

A stay of at least 17 years in low-salinity waters — more than half a bull shark’s lifespan — was unprecedented.

“This out of the ordinary occurrence has shown verifiably for the first time how long bull sharks are able to survive in these low-salinity environments,” Gausmann told CNN.

“The study has shown that bull sharks presumably have no limits to their residential time in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers, and they are presumably – at least theoretically – able to spend their entire lifetime in these habitats.”

Vanished

Sadly for Gausmann and Carbrook, the true extent of their survivability remains unknown.

It’s been eight years since a shark was last spotted in the lake. Their vanishing is a mystery, even to Gausmann.

Sightings dropped in frequency after the 2013 floods, leading to fears that some sharks may have returned to the river or died as a result of the storm. Just two sharks were confirmed dead; one found floating on the surface, another killed by illegal fishing.

Wagstaff, who had never noticed any sign of ill health among the sharks in more than 100 sightings, saw them only fleetingly after the fishing death. Gausmann believes it was unlikely the remaining sharks died in a “natural way” due to sodium loss or by any other “anatomical” failure, given their adaptability, and therefore theorizes that further illegal fishing is the “most likely” explanation for their disappearance.

Whatever the reason, it’s an absence felt keenly by the club.

“You can’t help yourself – you walk along the lake and you’re looking in, waiting to maybe catch a glimpse of a fin breaking the water,” Wagstaff said.

“The members loved the fact that their golf course was their unique place in the world where we had sharks; they just embraced it.

“We’d love to see them again.”

Last year, the course was submerged by the biggest flood ever recorded in the area, Wagstaff said. Though devastating financially, closing the club for two months, it sparked hope that new sharks may have crossed from the river to repopulate the lake.

Only time will tell, but Carbrook is already planning for a future without its mascot. Plans are in place to fill in the lake and build a new course there over the next decade, with all marine life – potential sharks included – subsequently relocated into waters elsewhere.

Whether Wagstaff ever spots another fin in the lake or not, he will remember “Patch” and co. fondly as the guests who helped him overcome his fears. Once afraid of the ocean due to sharks, Wagstaff recently went scuba diving in the reefs of the Sunshine Coast to get up close and personal with some large grey nurse sharks.

“There’s this kind of legend about sharks being aggressive because they’re coming into contact with humans, especially bull sharks because of the places they tend to swim – canals, creeks and rivers,” Wagstaff said.

“But then to experience them in such close proximity and see how beautiful they are and how graceful they are – now I just find them fascinating, especially the bull shark.

“They’re capable, so adaptive, and they are seriously beautiful when you’re a few feet away. It’s an incredible shark.”","['vanished', 'water', 'inadvertently', 'sharks', 'australian', 'club', 'carbrook', 'bull', 'lake', 'course', 'wagstaff', 'shark', 'river', 'golf']","Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks.

283,Hornussen: The dangerous Swiss golf-baseball hybrid you've never heard of,"CNN —

To most people, the words Swiss sport and Emmental might trigger thoughts of Roger Federer eating cheese.

Yet to those familiar with the sprawling countryside and farmlands of the Swiss heartland region where the cheese originated, there’s been a traditional game synonymous with the area for centuries.

Sending projectiles hurtling through the air at 200 miles per hour, all rise – and then duck – for Hornussen.

Risk and reward

Described as a hybrid of baseball and golf, Hornussen sees two teams of 18 take turns hitting and fielding the “Nouss” or “Hornuss,” a puck named after hornets for its buzzing sound as it whistles through the air.”

Armed with a 3-meter (9.84-foot) carbon stick called a “Träf,” hitters take to a raised batting ramp in front of a playing area – the “Ries” – some 300 meters (980 feet) long and 10 meters (32 feet) wide. Their task is to strike the puck from the sloped platform, known as the “Bock,” as far as they can down the field.

Scoring starts if they reach the 100-meter line, with an additional point awarded for every 10 meters past the marker. Crucially though, points are only registered if the Nouss lands, with fielders spread at intervals seeking to block the puck from landing with bats, or “Schindels.”

The sport’s format has drawn comparisons to golf, with some even suggesting it was a forerunner to the sport’s modern incarnation.

“The similarity is that like a ball, you hit a puck, and you hit it far away, but here you want to make some goals, not holes,” said Michael Kummer, member of national championship winning team Hochstetten Hornussen.

“People from other countries call Hornussen the ‘Farmer’s Golf’, so I think there’s some similarities.”

Yet while in golf only an errant shot is likely to present any danger to others, in Hornussen, putting yourself in harm’s way is an essential part of the game. With pucks of pressed plastic whizzing towards you at speeds akin to an F1 car, stopping them is a feat as treacherous as it is tricky. Though players often wear helmets and shielding gear, some take to the field without any such protection.

“It’s really dangerous if you don’t see the Nouss or if one hits the bat and, two meters before the face, the Nouss changes direction,” Kummer explained.

“If it goes in the eyes or around the head it’s really dangerous.”

‘The Lionel Messi of Hornussen’

Originating in the mid-17th century in the Emmental valley and, barring brief forays into neighboring Germany, Hornussen has never left Switzerland, with few teams existing outside the west-central canton of Bern.

The need for vast expanses of open grass to contest games forms part of the reason the sport has been limited to the rural area of Emmental, Kummer explains, adding that ventures into Germany ultimately fell short when teams couldn’t find enough players.

Yet for Kummer, it is this very rootedness in Switzerland that makes Hornussen – alongside yodeling and schwingen, a form of wrestling – a pillar of the nation’s sporting culture.

“With yodelling and schwingen it’s one of the three culture sports of Switzerland and we like it,” he said.

Around 260 teams are active across a multi-league pyramid in Switzerland, with the top teams fighting it out for the Swiss Championship.

And as winners of the last five titles, Kummer’s Hochstetten are very much the Bayern Munich of the Hornussen world.

With Hochstetten boasting a number of tall, strong players, at first glance it would seem that physical attributes are hugely influential in a team’s performance. Yet Kummer insists that size matters only up to a point.

“We have some big guys, but we also have small guys and it’s one of the nice things about this sport,” he said.

“The small guys can also make a good play in the field and they can hit the Nouss as long as the big guys.”

Take Kumer’ teammate Simon Ernie; though relatively diminutive in stature compared to some of his peers, Ernie was the league’s top scorer during his team’s most recent title winning campaign.

“He is the Lionel Messi of Hornussen, and he’s also a small guy,” Kummer said. “He’s one of the smallest on our team.”","['hornussen', 'puck', 'sport', 'swiss', 'golfbaseball', 'meters', 'nouss', 'heard', 'switzerland', 'hybrid', 'kummer', 'youve', 'teams', 'dangerous', 'golf']","CNN —To most people, the words Swiss sport and Emmental might trigger thoughts of Roger Federer eating cheese.

285,Bayard Rustin biopic spotlights organizer of the March on Washington,"CNN —

He stood 6-foot-1, weighed 190 pounds and moved with the grace of an athlete. A sharp dresser who favored linen shirts and stylish ties, Bayard Rustin sported a Clark Gable mustache and adopted a British accent that gave him an even more courtly bearing.

There was no civil rights leader who quite looked or spoke like Rustin. He was the Rev. Martin Luther King’s nonviolent spiritual mentor, the chief organizer of the epic 1963 March on Washington and an openly gay Black man who “never apologized for who he was, what he believed or who he desired” during an era when homosexuality was seen as a perversion deserving imprisonment.

“He looked great on a speaker’s platform,” says Arch Puddington, who worked with Rustin in the early 1970s at a labor organization that encouraged Black workers to be more active in unions.

“He’d get up and speak to some of these Black audiences and he could really set them on fire,” Puddington told CNN. “And he hardly ever spoke from a text. I would write text for him, and he would just completely ignore it.”

The man who organized what was then the largest peacetime protest in American history eventually became known as the movement’s “unsung hero,” largely fading into obscurity by his death in 1987.

But now Rustin is returning to the spotlight. “Rustin,” a biopic that depicts how Rustin navigated a gantlet of personal and political hurdles to pull off the March on Washington, debuts on Netflix today.

The film, made by Barack and Michelle Obama’s production company, comes amid a mini-Rustin renaissance. Recent months have also brought a new musical, “Bayard Rustin: Inside Ashland,” and a new book, “Bayard Rustin: A Legacy of Protest and Politics,” edited by Michael G. Long.

The new film is a good introduction to Rustin, and how social change takes place. Directed by George C. Wolfe, it crackles with energy. The actor Colman Domingo captures much of Rustin’s charisma and shrewd intelligence. The movie also reveals how some of the biggest battles civil rights leaders fought to put on the march were with one another, over turf and ego.

Much of the film’s urgency is a result of its tight focus. It’s structured around Rustin’s frantic campaign to organize the march, showing how he and 200 volunteers summoned 250,000 demonstrators to Washington with only two months for planning. They did so during an era of clattering typewriters, landline telephones and mimeograph machines — long before the internet or social media existed.

“It was the greatest moment in my life,” Rustin said in an oral history of the civil rights movement called “Voices of Freedom.”

It was one of the greatest moments in American history as well. The film, though, offers something more than a history lesson. It offers at least three lessons on leadership and social change.

Lesson 1: Character counts more than charisma

Character, it’s been said, is who you are when no one is watching. Rustin’s film, and his life, illustrates that lesson in several ways.

The civil rights movement was full of charismatic speakers. Yet many of its greatest leaders defined themselves not by what they said on camera, but by the decisions they made in private.

Malcolm X, for example, could fire up a crowd like few others. But his decision to break with Elijah Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam, helped seal his greatness. He knew his decision would likely cost him his life, but he was willing to take that chance because of his integrity.

King’s decision to oppose the Vietnam War was also widely unpopular. He lost the support of an American president, Black leaders turned against him and donations to the civil rights organization he co-founded dried up. But he did so because, like Malcolm, he shared a core commitment to his integrity.

Many pivotal moments in “Rustin,” and in the activist’ life, come down to the same moral calculus.

In a tense, private meeting depicted in the film, A. Philip Randolph (magnificently played by actor Glynn Turman) stands up for Rustin when other civil rights leaders tried to get him booted from the march because of his sexual orientation.

Rustin earned the respect of people like Randolph and King in part because of what he did when the cameras weren’t turned toward him.

He was a pacifist who went to prison during World War II rather than violate his beliefs. He did time on a chain gang and was viciously beaten several times for his activism but refused to retaliate because of his belief in nonviolence.

He also spent time in India studying Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolence, which he later passed on to King — leading some to call him the “American Gandhi.”

Rustin was deeply involved in virtually every major civil rights struggle of the mid-20th century, when many of those movements weren’t popular or covered by the press.

“He [Rustin] established a standard for honesty and fortitude that was unusually high in his era and much needed in ours,” Puddington wrote in one essay about Rustin.

Rustin’s character could also be seen in the way he handled his sexual orientation: no apologies; no double life.

During one scene of the film, he tells King he’s not going to hide who he is from other civil rights leaders.

“On the day I was born Black, I was also born a homosexual,” he says. “They either believe in freedom and justice for all or they do not.”

Lesson 2: Every movement needs a ‘glue’ person

General Omar Bradley, an American commander during World War II, is known to have said: “Amateurs talk strategy and professionals talk logistics.”

Bradley’s quote may be apocryphal, but it reflects a truism in warfare. The best-supplied armies often win. Battlefield victories often result not from clever strategies but from logistics — making sure troops have enough supplies and working equipment.

The same principle applies in sports. In the NBA, for example, there are certain unglamorous players on championship teams known as “glue guys.” They do the dirty work of setting screens, delivering hard fouls, rebounding and playing defense.

Rustin was the “glue guy” leader for the civil rights movement. Every movement needs one.

Rustin was a great organizer because he paid attention to details. He knew how many sandwiches and portable bathrooms the March on Washington participants needed. He knew how to raise money, how to charter buses to Washington and how to negotiate with sound engineers to make sure King’s voice could be heard across the Mall when he delivered his climatic “I Have a Dream” speech.

Watching Rustin organize the march in the film felt more exciting than the film’s depiction of the march itself.

There’s a scene in the movie where Ella Baker, one of the leaders of the civil rights movement who never got her due because of her gender, tells Rustin about the Ying and Yang every movement needs: a person in front and a logistical master behind the scenes. She sees that in Rustin’s partnership with King.

“On your own, you and Martin are fine,” she tells Rustin. “But together, you are fire.”

Lesson 3: Action without hope is impossible

The author Rebecca Solnit once wrote: “Hope calls for action; action is impossible without hope.”

Solnit says some of the biggest enemies of social change are cynicism and pessimism. Opponents of movements often try to convince demonstrators that they have no reason to expect they could win.

But Rustin had an ability to inspire marginalized people to believe they could win. One of the best passages in the film shows him molding a group of young, Black, brown and White civil rights activists into the crack team that would organize the March on Washington.

Rustin’s exuberance reflected the spirit of his time. He lived in another America full of can-do spirit. The country had defeated fascism during World War II; rebuilt Europe, pledged to send a man to the moon and wipe out poverty with President’s Johnson’s Great Society program. That optimism seeps through the movie.

Some of that patriotism may seem naïve now, but it furnished the civil rights movement with tremendous vitality. There are scenes in the film of Rustin mobilizing his young volunteers that conjure memoires of former President Obama’s first campaign, when young people across America bonded together for “hope and change.”

At one point in the film, a young organizer proposes a wild idea, and while others shout the person down, Rustin praises the volunteer.

“Don’t stifle an impulse before it’s born,” he shouts with a huge smile.

Optimism was a core organizing principle for Rustin, says Puddington, who is also a senior scholar emeritus at the Freedom House, a group that defends human rights and promotes democratic change throughout the world.

“Bayard was among those rare individuals who believed that if your cause was just and you had access to the basic tools of democracy, your time would come,” Puddington wrote in an essay about Rustin.

“For gay people today who live in democratic settings, Bayard’s optimism has been validated with each new victory for equality.”

Rustin refused to be defined by his race or sexual orientation

There is one risk that comes with renewed appreciation of Rustin: It’s easy to short-change his complexity. He’s invariably defined primarily through his sexual orientation – something his enemies often did.

But Rustin said his faith as a Quaker was central to his identity.

“My activism did not spring from my being Black,” he once said. “It is rooted fundamentally in my Quaker upbringing.”

This April 1969 file photo shows Rustin in his Park Avenue office in New York City. A Quaker and a pacifist, Rustin served as chief strategist for Martin Luther King's march but was kept mostly in the background because some organizers considered him a liability. A. Camerano/AP

Rustin said those Quaker values were built “on the concept of a single human family,” and that racial injustice was a challenge to that belief.

“It demanded my involvement in the struggle to achieve interracial democracy, “he said, “but it is very likely that I would have been involved had I been a White person with the same philosophy.”

Rustin has been called many labels: a great civil rights activist, a gay pioneer, an “American Gandhi,” and “Mr. March on Washington.” Maybe it’s time we call simply describe him the way the author Cathy Young once did in an essay:

As “a great American and a true hero.”

287,Water at Kealia pond in Hawaii has turned pink amid drought,"CNN —

A pond in Hawaii looks like something right out of a fairy tale. Water at the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge, one of the few coastal salt marshes on the island of Maui, has been bright pink since at least October 30, officials say, after its salt content surged amid an extreme drought.

Water samples sent to the University of Hawaii suggest that halobacteria is behind the pond’s new magenta hue, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

Halobacteria are single-celled organisms that thrive in very salty water, like the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. The bacterium is considered a so-called extremophile because of its ability to live in such an extreme environment – in this case, one where the water salinity is twice that of seawater, Fish and Wildlife noted.

While Kealia literally means “salt encrustation,” the pond’s salinity has skyrocketed well beyond normal because of Maui’s extreme drought. The entire island is in severe or worse drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. The area where the Kealia Pond refuge is located is in what’s considered an extreme drought – the second-worst on the Drought Monitor’s scale.

The Waikapu Stream, which brings water from the West Maui Mountains down into the Kealia Pond, also flows through the area of extreme drought. Less freshwater input into the pond has driven the salt concentration up and provided a cozy haven for the brightly hued halobacteria.

Around 90% of Maui County, which includes other islands, is in at least severe drought – one that has grown even worse since a deadly wildfire ripped through Lahaina in August.

Scientists are still studying how the climate crisis will affect Hawaii, but overall there is confidence drought will get worse as global temperature increases – even in tropical areas such as this.","['water', 'pond', 'maui', 'kealia', 'drought', 'extreme', 'hawaii', 'salt', 'pink', 'turned', 'worse', 'amid', 'wildlife']","Water at the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge, one of the few coastal salt marshes on the island of Maui, has been bright pink since at least October 30, officials say, after its salt content surged amid an extreme drought.

288,"China blames Canada for ‘malicious, provocative’ moves after close midair intercepts over South China Sea","Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

China has accused Canada of carrying out “malicious and provocative” actions in the South China Sea, after the Canadian Navy said Chinese fighter jets endangered a helicopter in two close intercepts above international waters.

The comments come after CNN revealed last week that a Chinese warplane fired flares in front of a Canadian military helicopter on October 29, an operation that Canadian military officers said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft.

The incident was the second of two “unsafe” encounters the Canadian chopper had on that day with Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy J-11 fighters, which got as close as 100 feet (30 meters) from the helicopter, Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, told CNN in an interview on the warship.

Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair briefed reporters on the incidents later Friday, saying the Chinese jets’ actions were deemed to be “significantly unsafe” and put “the safety of all personnel involved in unnecessary risk.”

Canada said both incidents took place in international waters within the South China Sea.

China’s Defense Ministry hit back on Saturday, accusing Canada of violating Chinese and international laws, jeopardizing China’s sovereignty and security, and conducting “malicious and provocative act with ulterior motives.”

Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesperson for the Chinese Defense Ministry, said Canada’s HMCS Ottawa frigate flew two helicopter sorties with “unknown intentions” toward China’s airspace around the Xisha Islands – a disputed archipelago claimed by China, Vietnam and Taiwan and also known as the Paracel Islands.

“China’s People’s Liberation Army organized naval and air forces to conduct identification, verification in accordance with the law and issued multiple warnings. However, the Canadian helicopter not only refused to respond, but also took provocative actions such as flying at ultra-low altitudes,” Zhang said in a statement posted on the ministry’s website.

“We urge the Canadian side not to ignore the facts, stop exaggerating and hyping up (the incident), and to strictly restrict the actions of its frontline naval and air forces to prevent accidents at sea and in the air,” he added.

Millen, the Canadian air commander, told CNN he was piloting the helicopter on October 29, when Chinese J-11s intercepted it at close range while it flew straight and level at 3,000 feet above the water back toward the Ottawa, a signal to the Chinese that it had no hostile intent.

He said he had to descend to 200 feet – an area where the helicopter can operate but is “very uncomfortable for fast air fighter jets” – to end the “unsafe” encounter with Chinese jets.

The Chinese fighters flew in circles so close that his helicopter experienced turbulence coming off the jets, which posed a danger to the copter, Millen said.

China claims historic jurisdiction over almost the entirety of the vast South China Sea, which is a resource rich and vital international shipping route. Since 2014 Beijing has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants.

In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling and Western powers routinely conduct naval passages through the sea to uphold the claim that it is an international waterway.

The latest incidents are the second risky midair intercept Canada has accused China of conducting last month.

In mid-October, a Chinese fighter jet came within 5 meters (16 feet) of a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance and surveillance plane over the East China Sea.

That incident was recorded by news crews aboard the Canadian aircraft and witnessed by Maj. Gen. Iain Huddleston, the commander of Canada’s 1st Air Division, who was also on the plane.

Huddleston called the intercept “unprofessional” and “very aggressive” in a report from Radio Canada, which was on the plane.

“The Canadian aircraft was subject to multiple close-proximity maneuvers by a PLAAF aircraft that put the safety of all personnel at risk,” Canada’s Defense Ministry said in a statement.

China’s Foreign Ministry said the Canadian plane illegally entered Chinese airspace and accused the Canadian military of sending “warplanes halfway around the world to stir up trouble and make provocations at China’s doorsteps.”","['malicious', 'midair', 'close', 'helicopter', 'sea', 'intercepts', 'canada', 'chinese', 'international', 'china', 'air', 'south', 'moves', 'jets', 'provocative', 'canadian', 'ministry']","Hong Kong CNN —China has accused Canada of carrying out “malicious and provocative” actions in the South China Sea, after the Canadian Navy said Chinese fighter jets endangered a helicopter in two close intercepts above international waters.

289,Caster Semenya says she went through ‘hell’ due to testosterone limits imposed on female athletes,"CNN —

South Africa’s two-time Olympic champion Caster Semenya told CNN that having to take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete internationally was “hell” and had a negative impact on her health.

In her new book, “The Race To Be Myself,’ Semenya describes the damaging impact the medication had on her body and now says she wants to use her platform to stop other women having to endure the same thing.

“I would say it was hell because each and every day you live under stress,” Semenya told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga, speaking about taking the medication.

The runner has been at the forefront of controversy. She has been supported by athletes of world renown like tennis great Martina Navratilova but British runner Lynsey Sharp tearfully said how “difficult” it was for her and others to compete against Semenya.

Sharp broke down in tears after watching Semenya storm away to victory at the Rio Olympics in 2016.

Semenya is hyperandrogenous – meaning she has naturally high levels of testosterone – and is fighting against new rules introduced in 2019 by track and field’s governing body World Athletics (WA) – and previously known as the IAAF – that regulate levels of the hormone in female athletes.

In July this year, Semenya won an appeal which she had submitted to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to end the testosterone limits.

“You are not happy within; you are never happy. It makes you feel sick, nauseous. You have panic attacks. It starts creating a little bit of blood clots in your system,” Semenya says.

“Your stomach is burning. You eat a lot. You can’t sleep. You sweat a lot each and every day.

“It’s like digging a hole that you can never fill up. You know, it’s like you measure a casket and you get in and then you bury yourself. It was not easy. It was a hard time.”

In a statement to CNN, World Athletics said it stood by its rules and research.

“World Athletics has over a decade of research, directly from DSD athletes in our own sport, that show high testosterone levels do provide an unfair advantage in the female category,” World Athletics said.

“The research also shows that the frequency of DSD individuals in the elite athlete population is around 140 times higher than you will find in the general female population. This is why our guidelines on testosterone thresholds are necessary, reasonable, and proportionate to protect the integrity of the female category and have been upheld by two Courts.

“If we don’t protect the female category, then women and young girls will not choose sport.”

Inconclusive impact on performance

Semenya won the 800m gold medal at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics Games, but the rules introduced by World Athletics in 2019 meant she would need to take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete internationally over distances between 400m and one mile – something she has declined to do. She was unable to defend her 800m crown in Tokyo in 2021 because of the rule changes.

Variations in people’s reproductive anatomy, chromosome patterns or other traits that may not align with typical binary definitions of female or male are what is defined as differences in sex development (DSD).

It is difficult to estimate how many people have DSD traits – many live their entire lives without ever knowing they have one. Scientists estimate as many as one out of every 50 people is born with DSD traits.

Semenya acknowledged the differences in her body but insisted DSD athletes did not have an unfair advantage in the sport.

“I’m born a woman, but I’m a woman with no uterus. I have no fallopian tubes. I don’t go through menstruation,” Semenya said.

“Yes, I’m different, but it doesn’t make me less of a woman.”

“I am here where I am because of dedication, hard work, discipline and all those things,” she added.

“But then is it considered a threat to a man in sport because, when a woman does great, it becomes a problem. But when a man does good, they’re phenomenal.

“But genetically, it’s something that you can say you cannot control it.”

Semenya has been locked in a battle with World Athletics – notably with its president Sebastian Coe – for almost a decade over the issue of testosterone regulation and lost appeals against the ruling in both 2019 and 2020.

The science on the matter is not entirely conclusive.

Retired endocrinologist Peter Sonksen told CNN in 2021 that “there is good evidence to show muscle bulk increases with increasing dosage of testosterone,” but added that the relationship between blood testosterone level and performance remains “complex and controversial.”

New chapter

Semenya, 32, said she felt ready to write a book about her life, but admitted facing questions about her gender at an early age was difficult.

In the book, she said she was 18 when she first faced scrutiny from World Athletics, then known as the IAAF.

Semenya described the moment as “life-changing.”

“You are 18 years of age and then you get asked if you are not woman enough. Your entire childhood you have been a woman, regardless of the differences that you have in your body,” she said.

“But I think for me, what I had to turn around was the humiliation, you know, the injustice and people treating me with no respect.

“I think the importance for me was knowing who I am, my identity and carrying that to represent my country.”

290,"Exclusive: Chinese jet fired flares close to submarine-hunting helicopter in South China Sea, Canadian Navy says","Aboard HMCS Ottawa CNN —

A Chinese warplane fired flares in front of a Canadian military helicopter over international waters of the South China Sea last Sunday, an operation that Canadian military officers said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft.

“The risk to a helicopter in that instance is the flares moving into the rotor blades or the engines so this was categorized as both unsafe and non-standard, unprofessional,” said Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, the warship from which the Sikorsky Cyclone helicopter was flying.

The incident was the second of two encounters the Ottawa’s helicopter had with Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy J-11 fighter jets over international waters on October 29, which saw the fighters get as close as 100 feet from the helicopter, Millen told CNN in an interview aboard the warship.

He said that Canada and other nations have seen Chinese aircraft get close to fixed-wing aircraft on numerous occasions, but it was rare to see such action taken against a helicopter.

The first incident was over international waters outside of 34 miles from the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the South China Sea. The second was also over international waters outside of 23 miles from the Paracels. The warship was operating in international waters 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of the Paracels at the time.

The Canadian helicopter was searching for a previously detected submarine when the incidents occurred, officers aboard the Ottawa said.

Millen said he was piloting the Canadian helicopter earlier in the day, when Chinese J-11s intercepted it at close range while it flew straight and level at 3,000 feet above the water back toward the Ottawa, a signal to the Chinese that it had no hostile intent.

In that earlier encounter, Millen said the Chinese fighters flew in circles around his helicopter.

“When the intercepting aircraft was closer and closer, at a certain point it became unsafe,” he said.

His helicopter experienced turbulence coming off the Chinese jets, also posing a danger to the copter, Millen said.

“I certainly am not as comfortable as you can be based on the fragility of the rotor system,” he said.

Millen said he ended that encounter by descending to 200 feet, an area where the helicopter can operate but is “very uncomfortable for fast air fighter jets.”

The Canadian air force major said his military’s air crews train on how to respond to such intercepts as occurred on Sunday and will continue to fly over the international waters of the South China Sea.

Asked about the interception at a regular press briefing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”

“We have reiterated many times our firm position on Canadian warplanes conducting reconnaissance near China’s territorial airspace,” he told reporters. “We hope Canada will refrain from its inappropriate behavior to avoid the situation from becoming more complicated.”

CNN has also reached to China’s Defense Ministry for comment.

China claims historic jurisdiction over almost the entirety of the vast South China Sea, and since 2014 has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants. The Paracels, called the Xisha Islands by China, are in the northern part of the South China Sea, east of Da Nang, Vietnam, and south of China’s Hainan Island.

The 1.3-million-square-mile waterway is vital to international trade, with an estimated third of global shipping worth trillions of dollars passing through each year. It’s also home to vast fertile fishing grounds upon which many lives and livelihoods depend.

In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling.

Freedom of navigation



Major western powers frequently conduct passage across the sea in order to assert that the region is international waters, sparking Beijing’s ire.

The Ottawa had been patrolling the waterway since last Monday, at times operating with United States, Australian, Japanese and New Zealand naval vessels and aircraft in a multinational exercise dubbed Noble Caribou. However, it was operating alone when the encounters with the Chinese jets.

The Ottawa and the US Navy destroyer USS Rafael Peralta overnight Wednesday into Thursday local time continued their deployment into the Taiwan Strait, another international waterway and vital shipping channel that has seen tense

encounters between PLA and allied vessels.

Last June, the US Navy reported a close encounter between the destroyer USS Chung-Hoon and a Chinese warship during a Taiwan Strait transit, in which the US warship slowed down to avoid colliding with the Chinese navy vessel that cut in front of it. The Canadian frigate HMCS Montreal was accompanying the US ship at the time, and a news crew aboard it recorded the incident.

Then Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu blamed the US for ratcheting up tensions in the region when questioned by reporters at a defense conference in Singapore.

“They are not here for innocent passage, they are here for provocation,” Li said of US warships.

Li said if the US and other foreign powers did not want confrontation, they should not send their military assets near China.

“Mind your own business,” Li said, adding, “Why did all these incidents happen in areas near China, not in areas near other countries?”

This week’s passage of the allied warships through the strait was uneventful, however, with no contact reported.

Sunday’s incidents come after other reports of unsafe intercepts of allied aircraft in the recent days.

On Tuesday, a PLA fighter jet came within 10 feet of a US Air Force B-52 bomber flying over the South China Sea, the US military said.

And earlier in October, a Chinese fighter jet came within five meters (16 feet) of a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance and surveillance plane over the East China Sea.

That incident was recorded by news crews aboard the Canadian aircraft and witnessed by Maj. Gen. Iain Huddleston, the commander of Canada’s 1st Air Division, who was also on the plane.

Huddleston called the intercept “unprofessional” and “very aggressive” in a report from Radio Canada, which was on the plane.

“The Canadian aircraft was subject to multiple close-proximity manoeuvres by a PLAAF aircraft that put the safety of all personnel at risk,” Canada’s Defense Ministry said in a statement.

China’s Foreign Ministry said the Canadian plane illegally entered Chinese airspace and accused the Canadian military of sending “warplanes halfway around the world to stir up trouble and make provocations at China’s doorsteps.”

In February, in an incident witnessed by a CNN crew, a Chinese fighter jet came within 500 feet of a US Navy reconnaissance plane flying at 21,500 feet about 30 miles from the Paracels.

Earlier this month, the Pentagon’s top official in charge of security in the Indo-Pacific, Ely Ratner, said that the US has seen more instances of “coercive and risky” behavior from Chinese pilots against US aircraft in the last two years over the East and South China Seas than in the entire decade before that.

“Since the fall of 2021, we have seen more than 180 such incidents,” Ratner said. “It’s a centralized and concerted campaign to perform these risky behaviors in order to coerce a change in lawful US operational activity.”","['waters', 'helicopter', 'close', 'sea', 'flares', 'submarinehunting', 'chinese', 'international', 'aircraft', 'fired', 'china', 'south', 'navy', 'jet', 'canadian', 'exclusive']","The first incident was over international waters outside of 34 miles from the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the South China Sea.

292,Images from Gaza show Israeli soldiers detaining dozens of men stripped to underwear,"Jerusalem CNN —

Images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday showed a mass detention by the Israeli military of men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds, and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle.

The exact circumstances and dates of the detentions are unclear, but some of the detainees’ identities were confirmed by colleagues or family members.

Both the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hamas responded Friday to the images.

IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus told CNN the men pictured were “Hamas members and suspect Hamas members.” He said they were “without clothes in order to make sure they’re not carrying explosives.”

Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas’ political office, accused Israel in a statement of “kidnapping, invasive searches and disrobing” what he said was “a group of displaced Palestinian civilians.” He called it a “reprehensible crime” and urged human rights organizations to intervene.

At least some of the men are civilians with no known affiliation to militant groups, according to a CNN interview with one of their relatives and a statement by one of their employers, a news network.

The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor posted an image of one detainment and said in a statement on its website Thursday that “the Israeli army detained and severely abused dozens of Palestinian civilians.”

“Euro-Med Monitor received reports that Israeli forces launched random and arbitrary arrest campaigns against displaced people, including doctors, academics, journalists, and elderly men,” it said.

CNN has geo-located some of the images to Beit Lahia, north of Gaza City.

The Israeli media, without indicating a source, has portrayed the images as the surrender of Hamas members. A journalist asked IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari about the images during a news conference on Thursday, saying, “We’ve seen images of many captives, Hamas terrorists, that the IDF arrested during the ground maneuvering.”

Hagari said that, in fighting Hamas, “those left in the area gradually come out.”

“We investigate and check who has ties to Hamas, and who does not,” he said. “We arrest them all and question them. We will continue dismantling each one of those strongholds until we are done.”

On Friday, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy told CNN that men depicted in images of mass detentions in Gaza were all “suspected terrorists.”

Israeli forces were apprehending military-age men in areas of Gaza where they had been urging evacuation for more than a month, according to Levy, describing these areas as “Hamas strongholds.” Those who were not terrorists would be released, he said.

The men can be seen in the cargo bed of a military vehicle. Obtained by CNN

In an interview with CNN on Friday, Hani Almadhoun, director of philanthropy for the US arm of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA USA) said he knew a dozen people pictured in circulating images, including his brother.

“They’re neither fighters, they’re not surrendering, they’re just civilians who were there with their families trying to survive this,” Almadhoun told CNN’s Pamela Brown.

Almadhoun said the men he knew from his family had since been released, but described the situation as “baffling” to see his brother, a father and a shopkeeper, “dragged” from his home as a suspected Hamas combatant.

“My brother has seizures and they had him naked in the street and they put him on the beach in the winter, naked taking pictures of him, verifying who he is, and then they released him after they roughed him up a little bit,” he said.

“There is a lot of trauma from this for anybody who is watching, especially for my mom who has lost her son,” he said after describing how another brother and his family had recently been killed in an air strike. “You don’t recover from this. This is not just about justice, this feels like more about revenge.”

His family remained in northern Gaza instead of evacuating because they had nowhere to go in the south and had a family member killed in a safe zone, he added.

In a statement Thursday, news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed said that one of its correspondents and several members of his family were among those detained as part of the incident portrayed in the images.

It reported that Diaa Al-Kahlout was arrested by Israeli troops at gunpoint and forced to leave his disabled daughter behind, before he was allegedly stripped and beaten.

“Today, Thursday, the Israeli occupation army arrested the journalist and the director of ‘The New Arab’ office in Gaza, our colleague Diaa Al-Kahlot, from Market Street in Beit Lahia, along with a group of his brothers, relatives, and other civilians,” Al-Araby Al-Jadeed wrote.

“The occupation deliberately forced Gazans to take off their clothes, searched them, and humiliated them when they were arrested before taking them to an unknown destination, according to what the people there told us. Pictures and video clips spread showing soldiers arresting dozens of Gazans using criminal and humiliating method.”

Hussam Kanafani, the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed editor-in-chief, said in the statement that Al-Kahlot and his family were still missing.

“We will make every effort possible, in cooperation with international institutions and organizations concerned with the rights and freedom of journalists in the world, to determine the whereabouts of our colleague Diaa and release him as soon as possible,” Kanafani said.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was concerned by reports of Al-Kahlout’s arrest and called for his release.

“The Israeli army should disclose his location, release him immediately, and take steps to ensure the safety of all journalists covering this war, especially those in Gaza who face imminent harm,” CPJ Middle East and North Africa Program Coordinator Sherif Mansour said in a statement.

293,"Vladimir Putin, Russian president, says he will seek re-election in 2024","CNN —

Vladimir Putin says he will run for president again in Russia’s elections in March 2024, in a move that could see him retain power until at least 2030.

Putin made the announcement Friday after a ceremony at the Kremlin, the official residence of the Russian president.

Putin will bid for his fifth presidential term at the elections, set to take place on March 17, 2024, as he aims to solidify his continuous hold on power as head of state or prime minister for more than two decades.

The upcoming elections will also mark the first time that residents of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, annexed by Russia during the conflict, will participate in the presidential elections.

Russia’s Central Election Commission said it would organize “house-to-house voting” in those four regions over three consecutive days on March 15, 16 and 17.

The international community previously condemned local elections in these regions, organized by Russian-backed officials, as a sham.

Putin became acting prime minister of Russia in August 1999, before unexpectedly being handed the presidency by then-President Boris Yeltsin on New Year’s Eve of that year.

He served two four-year terms as president before stepping aside in 2008, as he was not constitutionally permitted to run for another presidential term. He endorsed Dmitry Medvedev, who replaced him as president, while Putin took the role of prime minister for a second time.

But he regained the presidency in 2012 and has not relinquished his grip on power since. After winning re-election in 2018, Putin then signed a law in 2021 which paved the way for him to run for two more six-year terms.

The changes to the law means that Putin, 71, could potentially extend his rule until 2036, by which time he will be in his mid-80s and his rule will be well into its third decade.

Putin is expected to face no more than token opposition in March. Under his authoritarian rule, opposition politicians have met similar fates: Exile, imprisonment or death in suspicious circumstances.

Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who posed one of the most serious political challenges to Putin during his rule, was sentenced in August to 19 years in prison on extremism charges. Navalny and his supporters claim his arrest was politically motivated, intended to silence his criticism of Putin.

Navalny was immediately detained upon returning to Russia in 2021. He had been taken from Russian to Germany in 2020, after he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok. Navalny arrived comatose at a hospital in Berlin, following a medical evacuation flight from the Siberian city of Omsk. A joint investigation by CNN and the group Bellingcat implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in Navalny’s poisoning.

Russia denies involvement in Navalny’s poisoning. Putin said in December 2020 that if Russian security services had wanted to kill Navalny, they “would have finished” the job.

Putin’s war in Ukraine, initially expected by Russia to last just a few weeks, will likely have entered its second year by the time presidential elections are held in March. While accurately gauging public opinion in Russia is difficult, the war is still thought to command broad support among the public, despite the costs it has placed on Russian society.

The Kremlin tries to keep the Russian population isolated from the worst of the conflict, but Ukraine has repeatedly attempted to bring the war home to Russia, launching its own strikes on cities across the country – including on the Kremlin itself.

Russia has kept the casualty numbers from its war in Ukraine shrouded in secrecy. In September 2022, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said 5,937 troops had been killed in the war. The ministry has not published an update since.

But western intelligence assessments put the toll much higher. Western intelligence assessments put the toll much higher. The United Kingdom defense ministry said in October it is likely that Russia has suffered between 150,000 and 190,000 permanent casualties, meaning killed or permanently wounded, since February 2022.

Earlier this month, Russia announced it would increase its number of troops by 170,000, continuing to draw on its population as its invasion of Ukraine enters its 22nd month.","['russian', 'ukraine', 'elections', 'seek', 'reelection', 'putin', 'presidential', 'war', 'president', '2024', 'rule', 'vladimir', 'navalny', 'russia']","CNN —Vladimir Putin says he will run for president again in Russia’s elections in March 2024, in a move that could see him retain power until at least 2030.

294,Australia swelters under extreme heat as rare early cyclone barrels toward northern coast,"CNN —

A tropical cyclone has rapidly intensified off the northern coast of Australia as millions across the country endure heat wave conditions that are forecast to stretch into the weekend.

Severe tropical cyclone Jasper strengthened to the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane Friday, with maximum winds of 220 kilometers per hour (138 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.



“Further intensification Friday is possible, and a category 5 system cannot be ruled out,” the country’s meteorology bureau said.

Jasper is the earliest Category 4 tropical cyclone to form in the Coral Sea since records began in 1900, according to CNN research of National Hurricane Center storm tracks.

The storm, which is located 1,195 kilometers (742 miles) northeast of Queensland and moving south at 9 kph (6 mph), could strike the coast near Cairns, a city of 250,000 people, with maximum sustained winds of 140 kph (87 mph) by early Tuesday.

However, forecasters say its projected path could change.

The storm’s arrival is unusually early during El Niño, a climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and generally reduces rainfall along Australia’s east coast.

The system has impacted weather all over the world this year and can particularly influence storm seasons.

Meanwhile, heat warnings are in effect in several states and territories, including New South Wales, home to more than 8 million people.

Temperatures in the NSW capital Sydney are expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) on Saturday, according to Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology, with the heat fueled by strong, dry winds.

Some schools in Sydney were forced to shut Friday and a total fire ban was in place in some parts of NSW, due to the increased risk of bushfires.

A “catastrophic” fire rating was issued in parts of South Australia on Friday, the highest on the scale, which indicates that lives and properties are likely to be lost if a fire starts.

Extreme fire danger ratings were in place in parts of New South Wales and Victoria.

The heat is forecast to weaken somewhat by the end of the weekend into early next week.

Australia is one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of the climate crisis, with frequent heat waves, extreme rainfall and devastating bushfires.

Earlier this year, more than 20 runners in the Sydney Marathon were hospitalized in a heat wave during Australia’s warmest winter since records began in 1910.

Ski resorts, including Perisher, the country’s largest, also closed early due to a lack of snow.

Fears were particularly high as memories of the catastrophic 2020 Black Summer fires – the country’s worst in decades – remain etched in the minds of millions of Australians.

The fires burned 10 million hectares (24.7 million acres), killing dozens of people and destroying more than 3,000 homes.","['storm', 'heat', 'rare', 'barrels', 'early', 'northern', 'cyclone', 'australia', 'sydney', 'mph', 'swelters', 'million', 'extreme', 'coast', 'south', 'parts', 'tropical']","CNN —A tropical cyclone has rapidly intensified off the northern coast of Australia as millions across the country endure heat wave conditions that are forecast to stretch into the weekend.

295,Italy quits Belt and Road plan as Europe rethinks China relations,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

Italy, the only G7 country to join China’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative, will leave the global infrastructure program when its contract expires next year - the latest sign of hardening European attitudes to Beijing and its global ambitions.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Thursday confirmed the widely expected move, a campaign pledge during her run for office last year amid complaints the deal signed with China by a previous government in 2019 had brought few benefits to Italy’s economy.

Meloni stressed however that Rome could maintain good ties with Beijing outside the program, which has expanded China’s global influence while raising concerns it has saddled some countries with unmanageable debt.

“I think that we should … improve our cooperation with China on trade, the economy,” Meloni told reporters, according to Reuters, in her first public comments on the issue after reports Italy had told China of its decision not to extend the pact after it expires in March 2024.

“The tool of the (BRI) … has not produced the results that were expected,” she added.

Italy’s move comes as the European Union has embarked on a campaign to “de-risk” its supply chains from China’s and secure sensitive technologies after the bloc deemed Beijing a “systemic rival” in 2019.

Those frictions were on show Thursday during a summit between EU heads and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing, where the two sides grappled with points of contention from trade to Russia’s war in Ukraine - with little concrete progress made.

China’s Foreign Ministry took a measured tone when asked about the Italian withdrawal during a regular press briefing Thursday, pointing to the “enormous appeal and global influence of Belt and Road cooperation.”

“China firmly opposes attempts to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation or stoke bloc confrontation and division,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, without referring directly to Italy.

‘Wicked’ decision

China has inked agreements with what it says are more than 140 countries for partnership on the program, which has funneled hundreds of billions of dollars into roads, ports, airports and bridges, largely across the Global South over the past decade.

Italy’s decision to join the scheme in 2019 was widely seen at the time as a diplomatic win for Beijing – and drew criticism from Washington and Brussels.

In an interview with newspaper Corriere della Sera this summer, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto branded the 2019 decision as “wicked,” citing growing trade imbalances between the two countries.

China imported $26.9 billion in Italian goods last year, compared with $21.4 billion in 2019. By contrast, Chinese exports to Italy rose to $50.5 billion from $33.5 billion over the same period, according to China’s customs data.

Rome joined the scheme under former China-friendly Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who condemned the withdrawal in an interview posted to his Facebook page, saying it was made for “ideological reasons” and risked “scuppering” potential expansion of Italian exports.

Chinese Ambassador to Italy Jia Guide earlier this year in an interview with Italian news outlet Fanpage suggested a “reckless” decision to withdraw from the pact would have a “negative” impact on cooperation.

Italian leaders have appeared keen to navigate the withdrawal carefully, with Meloni repeatedly suggesting it was possible to have good relations with China outside the Belt and Road plan. She has also previously denied speculation that the United States pressured her to quit the scheme.

EU meeting in Beijing

The news of Rome’s withdrawal came as the delegation of top European Union officials arrived in Beijing for the first in-person EU-China summit in four years.

The meeting was seen by Chinese leaders as a key opportunity to smooth contentious relations with Europe, which Beijing continues to see as a key potential counterweight in its competition with the United States.

“We should not view each other as rivals just because our systems are different, reduce cooperation because competition exists, or engage in confrontation because there are disagreements,” Xi told the visiting leaders, according to China’s official readout.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel pressed Xi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang on the gaping trade deficit between their economies and “unfair competition,” while Li urged the EU to be “prudent” in its use of “restrictive” economic policies.

Though the summit appeared to do little to resolve key issues, Von der Leyen said it saw both sides agree “that it is in our joint interest to have balanced trade relations.”

The EU side would be looking for “concrete progress following these discussions,” the bloc said in a statement after the meeting.","['chinas', 'belt', 'italian', 'europe', 'relations', 'road', 'european', 'italy', 'trade', 'china', 'withdrawal', 'global', 'beijing', 'plan', 'quits', 'rethinks']","Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

296,UPenn President Liz Magill under fire over her testimony on antisemitism: ‘An utter disgrace’,"New York CNN —

The growing chorus of donors, politicians, business leaders and other prominent figures calling for the immediate ouster of University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill has reached a crescendo after her disastrous testimony at a House hearing earlier this week.

During Tuesday’s House hearing, Magill, along with the presidents of Harvard and MIT, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

Magill had already been under fire prior to Tuesday’s hearing after multiple incidents of antisemitism on campus in recent months – and what critics have said was a tepid response to those incidents.

After the fallout from Tuesday’s hearing, Magill attempted to clarify her message on Wednesday, posting a video on X in which she said she should have focused on the “irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate.”

Magill said Wednesday that Penn’s policies “need to be clarified and evaluated,” adding that in her view: “It would be harassment or intimidation.”

Harvard University president Claudine Gay has apologized for her comments in an interview with the student newspaper Thursday.

“I am sorry,” Gay said to The Harvard Crimson. “Words matter.”

But Magill has not apologized. Penn’s stakeholders remain unsatisfied. Here is who is calling for Magill to resign:

A bipartisan group of more than 70 members of Congress on Friday sent a letter to board members of Harvard, MIT and Penn demanding Magill and her counterparts at the other two universities be dismissed.

“Given this moment of crisis, we demand that your boards immediately remove each of these presidents from their positions and that you provide an actionable plan to ensure that Jewish and Israeli students, teachers, and faculty are safe on your campuses,” the lawmakers wrote.

“The university presidents’ responses to questions aimed at addressing the growing trend of antisemitism on college and university campuses were abhorrent,” the lawmakers added.

Former US Ambassador Jon Huntsman Thursday night called on Penn’s board of trustees to remove Magill.

“Let’s make this great institution shine once again,” Huntsman said in a statement shared exclusively with CNN on Thursday evening. “We are anchored to the past until the trustees step up and completely cut ties with current leadership. Full stop.”

Huntsman, the former governor of Utah, was a 1987 graduate and former UPenn trustee. In October, he blasted Penn’s response to antisemitism on campus and promised to halt his family’s donations to the university. The Huntsman family has been such prominent supporters of UPenn that the Huntsman name is on the main Wharton School building.

Now, Huntsman is going further, calling for a complete leadership change.

“At this point it’s not even debatable,” Huntsman said. “Just a simple IQ test.”

Stone Ridge Holdings CEO Ross Stevens, a major donor to Penn, sent a letter on Thursday to Penn threatening to take steps that would cost the Ivy League school approximately $100 million if Magill stays on as president.

Stevens, a Penn alum and CEO of Stone Ridge Holdings, argues he has clear grounds to rescind $100 million worth of shares in his company that are currently held by Penn. He specifically cites Magill’s disastrous testimony before Congress earlier this week.

“Absent a change in leadership and values at Penn in the very near future, I plan to rescind Penn’s Stone Ridge shares to help prevent any further reputational and other damage to Stone Ridge as a result of our relationship with Penn and Liz Magill,” Stevens said in a note to his employees on Thursday obtained by CNN.

The Wharton Board of Advisors, comprised of a powerful group of business leaders, including NFL owner Josh Harris, former Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky, Related Companies CEO Jeff Blau, Blackstone exec David Blitzer and BET CEO Scott Mills, has called for Magill’s immediate ouster.

“As a result of the University leadership’s stated beliefs and collective failure to act, our Board respectfully suggests to you and the Board of Trustees that the University requires new leadership with immediate effect,” the Wharton Board of Advisors wrote in a letter sent directly to Magill.

The letter, which appears to have been sent Wednesday, specifically cites Magill’s testimony.

Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, called the testimony “catastrophic and clarifying” and said Magill’s attempt to clean-up her testimony “looked like a hostage video, like she was speaking under duress.”

“I understand why the governor of Pennsylvania and so many of the trustees don’t have confidence in her. I don’t have confidence anymore that Penn is capable, under this leadership, of getting it right,” Greenblatt told CNN’s Kate Bolduan, adding that he has spoken with Magill.

Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Thursday said she agrees with calls for the presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania to resign, arguing they are “failing in the worst way.”

“Their statements were abhorrent,” Gillibrand told Fox News, referring to Tuesday’s hearing in the House. “Trying to contextualize what constitutes harassment? Jewish students are terrified on these campuses.”","['huntsman', 'disgrace', 'penns', 'liz', 'ceo', 'board', 'hearing', 'upenn', 'university', 'utter', 'penn', 'president', 'tuesdays', 'testimony', 'leadership', 'antisemitism', 'magill']","During Tuesday’s House hearing, Magill, along with the presidents of Harvard and MIT, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment.
Magill had already been under fire prior to Tuesday’s hearing after multiple incidents of antisemitism on campus in recent months – and what critics have said was a tepid response to those incidents.
Former US Ambassador Jon Huntsman Thursday night called on Penn’s board of trustees to remove Magill.
In October, he blasted Penn’s response to antisemitism on campus and promised to halt his family’s donations to the university.

297,Diphtheria: West Africa battles worst outbreak in recent times,"CNN —

In Nigeria’s northern state of Kano, doctors and health workers are grappling with one of the worst diphtheria outbreaks in recent times.

Cases have been reported in the country since May of last year, but in the past few months, the outbreak has spread at an alarming rate, health officials say. Local, federal, and international bodies have struggled to contain the bacterial disease, with 17,000 suspected cases in Nigeria so far.

Worryingly, the outbreak has now spread to other West African countries such as Niger and Guinea and Medecins San Frontieres (MSF) says these nations are currently facing some of the most severe outbreaks of this vaccine-preventable disease ever documented on the continent.

However, the epicenter remains Kano, MSF health workers told CNN. So far, they have confirmed 9,310 cases and 368 deaths this year.

At its peak, MSF in Kano reported up to 700 cases a week. This rate dropped in September, but cases are slowly starting to rise again, currently at 500 weekly.

A bacterial disease

Diphtheria is a bacterial disease that creates a toxin that kills tissues and attacks cells in the respiratory system, making it hard for patients to breathe and swallow. If the toxin enters the bloodstream, it can damage the nervous system, and cause heart and kidney damage or paralysis, even after recovery, according to an MSF explainer on the disease.

Murjanatu Muhammad, a 30-year-old from Kano, has seen all of her children, 10-year-old Mohammed, eight-year-old Fatima, and twins Jamila and Husseina, aged five, admitted to hospital with diphtheria.

“You can imagine if we didn’t bring these children early enough, we don’t know what would have happened to them,” she told CNN.

For another mother, Firdausa Salisu, her son Auwal Nura has been sick since he was born four years ago and was receiving treatment from a traditional healer who advised against vaccines, his mother said.

“The traditional medicine man that was treating him advised that he should not be vaccinated at the time. By the time he recovered and I wanted him to be vaccinated, I was told he was past the age of receiving the vaccines.”

High mortality in children

Thousands of children like Auwal have experienced the alarming range of symptoms caused by diphtheria, says Dr. Hashim Juma.

Dr. Juma, with over 20 years of experience in the field, is currently based in Kano working as the emergency medical coordinator for MSF.

“This is very serious. Patients come in vomiting blood, paralysis in the legs… there is high mortality, particularly with children.” Dr. Hashim Juma, Medecins Sans Frontieres.

“Never have I ever faced this outbreak, in terms of the number of people infected, the mortality, and the complications as well,” he told CNN via a phone call from Kano.

“There are many diseases with complications, but this is very serious. Patients come in vomiting blood, paralysis in the legs… there is high mortality, particularly with children.”

Medical workers have been struggling to treat patients effectively, partly due to a lack of diphtheria anti-toxins (DAT).

So far, MSF says it has only been able to provide 5,000 DAT doses to patients.

With each severe case requiring eight to 10 vials each, this remains far from enough to support those who need it. Without treatment, patients face a roughly 50% chance of death, which reduces to a 5% chance if treated, Dr. Dagemlidet Tesfaye Worku, emergency medical program manager for West and Central Africa at MSF told CNN.

DAT doses and antibiotics are particularly hard to come by due to the lack of production, as well as the cost and time needed to manufacture.

Dr. Dagemlidet says that only three companies produce these doses, two of whom are approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).

He added that manufacturers need four weeks to make one batch of 1,500 DAT doses, and treating patients could cost up to 350 Euros ($370) from DAT alone. He believes this needs to change as soon as possible.

“In the short term, we need to improve production capacity of anti-toxins. Long term, we need to invest in research and development,” Dr. Dagemlidet says.

“It’s a global health crisis… in our globalized world, an outbreak can happen here, or in an urban area somewhere else. Global health security is so important.”

Vaccine mistrust

Vaccination has also played a crucial role in this ongoing outbreak. Whilst some vaccine uptake has helped prevent infections, there are a number of barriers from increasing uptake.

As of November, only 30% of patients in Kano had full vaccine protection, according to MSF. This rate is at its lowest in the northwestern state of Sokoto at just 6%. In response, WHO and UNICEF have started a vaccination campaign across 14 states in Nigeria.

Dr. Juma explains that in Kano there is mistrust and lack of awareness surrounding vaccines. He says: “There is a vaccine hesitancy here. People have had a bad experience with the side effects before. During our first intervention, we could see people were not highly welcoming to the vaccine team.”

The lack of vaccination coverage also applies to the rest of West Africa, with 65% of diphtheria patients having never received a single vaccine dose.

In late November, WHO published an updated explainer on diphtheria, emphasizing the importance of high vaccine uptake to tackle the outbreak. The organization recommends six vaccine doses to babies at six weeks old to provide long-term protection.

GAVI, a vaccine alliance programme, also announced on December 4 that eligible countries can now apply to implement diphtheria vaccines into their health programs.

As the outbreak has escalated since July, Dr. Juma has seen vaccine uptake improve. In order to contain this surge of diphtheria, and help prevent future outbreaks too, this trend must continue.

With the disease now present in neighboring Niger, there is concern that once again the population is not adequately equipped. Dr. Juma says that there is little to no vaccination coverage there, a great concern considering the high level of movement between Kano and Niger.

In order to address the outbreak, the message is clear. Vaccination must improve. Dr. Juma says: “We stress the need to make the routine vaccination system stronger and stronger… then you can control the outbreak.”

Lessons have also been learned regarding doses of antitoxins and antibiotics, explains Dr. Dagemlidet. He says: “We need to have at least a minimum quantity of anti-toxins in each country, so when the first cases happen, adequate resources are available to help local areas.

“The best way of responding to emergencies is anticipation and prevention.”","['juma', 'outbreak', 'worst', 'patients', 'recent', 'vaccine', 'diphtheria', 'kano', 'africa', 'msf', 'dr', 'health', 'battles', 'need', 'west', 'times']","CNN —In Nigeria’s northern state of Kano, doctors and health workers are grappling with one of the worst diphtheria outbreaks in recent times.

298,US State Department asks Congress to approve sales of tank munitions to Israel,"CNN —

The US State Department has asked Congress to approve a sale of tens of thousands of munitions for Israeli tanks, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN.

The request, which the source said was received within the last week and is being reviewed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is for 45,000 shells for Israeli Merkava tanks, the source said. The source added that the committees are under “pressure” from the State Department to approve the request quickly amid Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.

The request comes as the US is under growing domestic and international pressure to support a ceasefire in Gaza, and place conditions on some of the weapons it is providing to Israel.

“As a matter of policy, we do not confirm or comment on proposed defense transfers or sales until they have been formally notified to Congress,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN when asked about the request.

Reuters first reported the request.

In early November, the State Department formally notified congressional leaders that it would be transferring $320 million worth of precision-guided bomb equipment to Israel, CNN previously reported.

Israel has received 200 cargo planes of military equipment from “several countries” since the Hamas terror attack on October 7, including ammunition, armored vehicles, and weapons, according to the Israeli Ministry of Defense.

The Israeli ministry said more than 10,000 tons of military equipment have been delivered since the start of the war.

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense said the aid had come from “several countries,” but declined to say what other countries had sent aid or how much of it had come from the United States.

The shipments of US military aid began soon after the war began. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was in Israel on October 13 as a C-17 cargo plane landed with security assistance to Israel.

“There’s a lot more that follows this,” Austin said at the time.

Unlike security assistance to Ukraine where the US details types of weapons and capabilities, the shipments to Israel have been far more discrete, with the Defense Department rarely acknowledging or announcing what types of weapons or equipment it is sending.

In late-October, a senior defense official said the US was expediting the delivery of precision-guided joint direct attack munitions (JDAMs) to Israel, which turn unguided bombs into smart weapons. The US has also expedited the delivery of Iron Dome interceptor missiles for Israel’s primary aerial defense system.

The use of US weapons in Israel’s ongoing war has drawn increased scrutiny following an Amnesty International report this week which claimed that US-made JDAMs were used in two strikes in October which killed 43 civilians. The human rights organization said it “did not find any indication that there were any military objectives at the sites,” a conclusion the Israeli military rejected as “flawed, biased and premature.”

The US State Department and the Defense Department both said they are reviewing Amnesty International’s report.

“We have made clear in our discussions with Israeli leaders that we are deeply concerned about the protection of civilians in this conflict,” State Department spokesman Matt Miller said Wednesday. “We expect Israel to only target legitimate targets and to adhere to the laws of armed conflict.”

299,"Israeli tank fire killed Reuters journalist in October attack, CNN analysis suggests","CNN —

Israeli tank fire killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and injured six other international journalists in a double strike in southern Lebanon on October 13, forensic analysis by CNN suggests, confirming reports by two news organizations and two human rights groups.

On Thursday, Reuters, AFP, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch released investigations into the circumstances of the deadly strike. AFP and HRW claimed the strike was a “deliberate,” targeted attack by Israel on the journalists. In a statement to Reuters, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Richard Hecht said: “We don’t target journalists.” He did not provide further comment, the news agency reported.

The Israel Defense Forces on Friday said that the October incident in which a Reuters journalist was killed is still “under review.”

AFP photographer Christina Assi had her leg amputated and remains in the hospital as a result of the strike, according to AFP.

Eylon Levy, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, said Thursday that he was “not familiar” with the new reports. “The guiding principle in Israel’s campaign against Hamas is we uphold the principles of international law regarding proportionality, necessity, distinction,” he said. “We target Hamas, we do not target civilians.”

CNN’s forensic analysis of multiple videos, including a live AFP video feed from the time and place of the attack, has determined that the two strikes – 37 seconds apart – that hit the journalists was a supersonic event that came from the direction of Israel.

Israel and Hezbollah were engaged in intense crossfire across the Lebanon-Israel border at the time.

CNN has also seen a photo from the scene of the attack showing the tail fin of a 120 mm tank shell. The photo was verified by a source familiar with the investigation.

Neither the Lebanese army nor the Iran-backed Hezbollah are known to have such ammunition in their arsenal.

“That is a 120mm high explosive tank shell. Very clearly high explosive and not a different type of shell,” said Marc Garlasco, a former defense intelligence analyst and UN war crimes investigator, who saw the photo obtained by CNN as well as video of the aftermath of the attack. “(Aftermath video is) very indicative of a direct fire munition and matches with the 120 fragments.”

“The shooter should have seen the journalists from the tank,” he added.

British weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith said the photograph of the remnants of the shell clearly showed an “expended tank round.”

“Two projectiles hit the area of the media crews and from the damage to the wall, the location where Issam’s body ended up and from an analysis of the second crater, I believe the shots came from the area of the high ground just over the border,” said Cobb-Smith, referring to a foot-high wall seen in aftermath video near Abdallah’s body. Cobb-Smith said his analysis of the damage left by the projectile suggested that the attack came from a southeasterly direction.

CNN also consulted with audio expert Robert Maher, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University.

Maher determined that the attack was likely a “supersonic event” due to the absence of an “approaching whoosh or whine, as you might see with artillery fire.”

Cobb-Smith’s theory that the shells travelled from the southeast would be consistent of the findings of the investigations released Thursday.

Hours after the attack on October 13, CNN reported that the journalists attacked were wearing clearly labelled press flak jackets. It also reported that an Israeli Apache helicopter was seen over the site of the attack around the time of the attack, according to a Lebanese security source, which would have given Israeli forces added visibility over the journalists.

Israeli surveillance towers are seen in video of the attack, raising further doubt that Israel had not realized the tank crew was attacking journalists.

‘Under review’

In its statement Friday, the IDF said, “On October 13, 2023, the terrorist organization Hezbollah launched an attack on multiple targets within Israeli territory along the Lebanese border,” the IDF said in a statement. “One incident involved the firing of an anti-tank missile, which struck the border fence near the village Hanita.”

CNN reported that exchange of fire at the time of the incident.

“Following the launch of the anti-tank missile, concerns arose over the potential infiltration of terrorists into Israeli territory. In response, the IDF used artillery and tank fire to prevent the infiltration. The IDF is aware of the claim that journalists who were in the area were killed,” the statement continued.

“The area is an active combat zone, where active fire takes place and being in this area is dangerous. The incident is currently under review,” the IDF said.

IDF spokesperson Richard Hecht on October 14 called Abdallah’s death “a tragic thing,” without naming him directly or acknowledging Israel’s involvement. The same day, the IDF said: “A report was received that during the incident, journalists were injured in the area. The incident is under review.”

Speaking Thursday in Washington, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Abdallah’s death should be investigated. Blinken said it was his understanding that Israel had begun such an investigation and stressed the importance of seeing it through.

A Pentagon spokeswoman said earlier that the agency had not conducted its own assessment of Abdallah’s death but it continued to urge Israel to protect innocent civilians, including members of the press.

Al Jazeera has accused Israel’s military of “deliberately targeting the journalists to silence the media,” saying the attacks are a part of “a pattern of ‘repeated atrocities’ against journalists.”

The Committee to Protect Journalists also said the results of the investigations by Reuters, AFP, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch were in alignment with its own findings that show a “pattern of lethal force” by the Israeli military against journalists over the past 22 years.

The press freedoms group had documented at least 20 journalist killings by the IDF since 2001, it said in a report released May 2023. “The vast majority – 18 – were Palestinian. No one has ever been charged or held accountable for these deaths,” the report said.

‘Deliberate and targeted’

Amnesty International’s investigation did not find “any indication that there were any fighters or military objectives at the site of the strikes.”

“Israeli forces had observation towers, ground elements, and air assets deployed to closely monitor the border. All of this should have provided sufficient information to Israeli forces that these were journalists and civilians and not a military target,” Amnesty said in its report.

“Our investigation into the incident uncovers chilling evidence pointing to an attack on a group of international journalists who were carrying out their work by reporting on hostilities. Direct attacks on civilians and indiscriminate attacks are absolutely prohibited by international humanitarian law and can amount to war crimes,” said Aya Majzoub, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.

“The strikes were deliberate and targeted,” AFP said in its report. AFP global news director Phil Chetwynd said in the report, “AFP has been very clear that we will take all judicial avenues that we deem relevant and possible to ensure that we can get justice for Christina and Issam.”

Dylan Collins, a journalist with AFP who survived the attack, told CNN it was “hard not to see it as a deliberate strike.”

Collins, AFP’s Lebanon/Syria video coordinator, recounted what started as a “pretty quiet day,” describing how teams of Reuters and AFP journalists, all wearing flak jackets, helmets with press written across them, moved toward a plume of smoke after hearing “loud bangs” along the Lebanon-Israel border.

“The Israelis had drones in the air the entire time. And I imagine you know with their state-of-the-art surveillance capabilities, they could see our faces, they probably knew which channels we were working for… At around 6:02 that evening, we were struck directly,” Collins added.

“It was two strikes 37 seconds apart, almost in the same exact location on a group of journalists, seven journalists all wearing press vests and helmets,” Collins said.

The AFP journalist paid tribute to Abdallah, describing him as the “beating heart of the press scene” in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

Speaking of AFP colleague Assi, who sustained “devastating” injuries from the strikes, Collins said, “she’s bled more than any human should bleed.”","['israeli', 'video', 'analysis', 'international', 'idf', 'israel', 'suggests', 'tank', 'cnn', 'journalist', 'attack', 'journalists', 'afp', 'incident', 'killed']","CNN —Israeli tank fire killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and injured six other international journalists in a double strike in southern Lebanon on October 13, forensic analysis by CNN suggests, confirming reports by two news organizations and two human rights groups.

300,Al-Nasr hospital: Infants found dead and decomposing in evacuated Gaza ICU. Here’s what we know,"Editor’s Note: The following story includes graphic material. Audience discretion is advised.

CNN —

The scene inside the Al-Nasr hospital ICU ward is chilling. The tiny bodies of babies, several still attached to wires and tubes that were meant to keep them alive, decomposing in their hospital beds. Milk bottles and spare diapers still next to them on the sheets.

The video inside the hospital was filmed on November 27 by Mohamed Baalousha, a Gaza reporter for UAE-based news outlet Al Mashhad. He shared an unblurred version with CNN, which shows the remains of at least four infants.

Three of them appear to be still connected to hospital machines. The bodies of the babies appear to be darkening and disintegrating from decay, with little more than skeletons left in some of the beds. Flies and maggots are visibly crawling across the skin of one child.

The circumstances around one of the most horrifying videos to emerge from the war in Gaza remain unclear, but after days of piecing together available information, using interviews, published statements and video, a chaotic scene can been painted of hospital staff trying to protect their most vulnerable patients, caught in the middle of a raging battle – waiting for help that never arrived.

Here is what CNN found

CNN geolocated the video to Al-Nasr hospital in northern Gaza. This area has been largely unreachable to journalists in recent weeks due to the intensity of fighting but during the seven-day truce Baalousha says he was able to access the hospital to film what was left there.

From early November, the Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi children’s hospitals, which form part of the same complex, had become the frontline of fighting between Israeli and Hamas forces.

In public statements and interviews, several medical staff and health officials from Al-Nasr said they had to hurriedly evacuate the hospital on November 10, under the direction of Israeli forces.

Medical staff described having to leave young children behind in the ICU because they had no means to safely move them.

A doctor associated with the hospital, who did not want to be named, told CNN that two of the children – a two-year-old and a nine-month-old baby – had died shortly before the evacuation but that three children were left alive still connected to respirators. One of those left alive was two months old. Several of the infants on the ICU had been suffering from genetic disorders, according to the doctor.

The condition of those left behind alive – both at the time the fighting reached the hospital and when the evacuation took place – remains unclear.

In a video on November 9, the head of Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi pediatric hospitals, Dr. Mustafa al-Kahlout, said Al-Nasr hospital had been “struck twice” sustaining “a lot of damage.”

Kahlout warned oxygen to the ICU “was cut off” and reported at least one patient had died as a result, with others facing the risk of death.

It’s unclear whether oxygen cylinders, seen next to some of the beds in the video from the hospital, were functioning or whether supplies had run out.

“The situation is really bad, we are surrounded… ambulances cannot reach the hospital, and ambulances that tried to reach Al-Nasr were targeted,” Kahlout said, calling on international organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to intervene and save the medical staff and patients who remained in the ICU.

Video shared on social media on November 9, which CNN verified, was filmed from inside Al-Nasr hospital and appears to show the aftermath of the building being hit.

Another from November 10 showed an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tank outside Al-Nasr, indicating the IDF was operating in the area. Another video from the same date showed civilians holding up makeshift white flags attempting to flee the hospital amid gunfire, then being forced to run back inside. It is not possible to tell from the video who is shooting.

Satellite imagery reviewed by CNN from November 11 shows large craters around the hospital complex, indicating the area had been under bombardment, making evacuation difficult.

But, in an audio recording of a conversation between a senior official at Al-Rantisi hospital and an officer from COGAT, which coordinates the Israeli government’s activities in the Palestinian territories and Gaza, it appears Israeli forces instructed hospital patients and staff to evacuate.

In the recording, released by the IDF on November 11, the Israeli officer assures the hospital official that ambulances will be arranged.

The hospital official tells the COGAT officer that ambulances cannot reach the hospital, and the officer replies: “I’ll arrange coordination with the primary aid center. Don’t worry, I’m near the army, it will be okay.”

“Will the ambulances take the patients and the medical staff?” the hospital official asks.

“No problem,” the COGAT officer responds, in the recording.

The hospital official then confirms that the COGAT officer is aware that people will be evacuating both Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi hospitals, and the COGAT officer says “yes, yes.”

But hospital officials say the ambulances never arrived.

“Many of the patients were carried out by their families, ambulances couldn’t reach the hospital,” Kahlout said in a news conference on November 14, following the evacuation.

Three children were left in the ICU attached to hospital machines but without oxygen, Kahlout said.

In an audio recording from November 10 released by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) a nurse who the organization said was volunteering in a personal capacity, said the hospital had been shelled, hitting multiple floors, water tanks, and electricity and oxygen stations.

The nurse – who CNN is not identifying for security reasons – said Al-Nasr staff were given 30 minutes to evacuate by the IDF, adding no ambulances were able to reach the hospital.

“We walked out a little bit there was shooting around us,” he said in the recording. Then he said someone from the IDF told him “I’ll give you safe passage, you have from 1130am until 12 noon.”

“So, we walked out with our hands up in the air carrying white flags and carrying families and children,” the nurse said in the recording.

He said he managed to carry one baby with him as he escaped and handed it to an ambulance headed for the Al-Shifa hospital. But four children were left behind in the ICU according to the nurse, in a discrepancy from the number given by Kahlout.

“To leave my patient dying in front of my eyes is the hardest thing I have ever experienced, it’s indescribable, they broke our hearts, we couldn’t help them, we couldn’t take them, we barely left ourselves with our children, we are civilians, we are a medical crew, we are displaced civilians,” he said in the recording.

Over the past week, CNN has tried to speak to medical staff and hospital officials from Al-Nasr, but all have either said they are too afraid to speak or cannot be reached.

The director of Gaza’s hospitals at the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health, Dr. Mohammad Zaqout, told CNN that people in the hospital were forced to leave by the IDF.

“We were forced to leave them behind to die because we didn’t have a safe medical evacuation… we informed them that these children were on beds and couldn’t be evacuated. We held other children in our arms while being forced to evacuate,” Zaqout said.

The IDF has strongly denied responsibility for the deaths of the children in Al-Nasr ICU. “Given that the IDF did not operate inside the Al-Nasr hospital, these allegations are not only false but also a perverse exploitation of innocent lives, used as tools to spread dangerous misinformation,” the IDF said in a statement to CNN.

Asked repeatedly by CNN why it hadn’t provided ambulances for the evacuation, as the COGAT officer had promised in the recorded conversation with the hospital official, and if they were aware of the presence of children left in the ICU, as Zaqout alleged, the IDF did not directly respond.

During an online Q&A for journalists Saturday, IDF spokesman Doron Spielman dismissed the story as merely a “rumor.”

“There were no premature babies that decomposed because of the IDF. There were probably no babies that decomposed whatsoever,” Spielman said. “But Hamas is in charge of Nasr hospital, we are not occupying Nasr hospital.”

Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals as command centers and even as places to hold hostages.

Zaqout denies the allegation and has repeatedly called for “neutral entities, human rights organizations, and media outlets to enter the hospitals and verify for themselves that they are used solely for civilian and humanitarian purposes.”

CNN cannot independently confirm what state the children were in when they were left at the hospital. But Stefan Schmitt, a forensic scientist at Florida International University reviewed the video for CNN and said the level of decomposition of the infants was advanced.

Schmitt said he believed the room had not been disturbed since the children were left. “Those remains decomposed in situ, meaning they decomposed there on those beds,” he said. “You can see that from the bodily fluids that have leaked out over the time of decomposition.”

Schmitt also said one of the corpses appeared to be wrapped in fabric, possibly a shroud, noting there was no medical equipment attached to the body, suggesting the body may already have been dead or severely injured. The room appeared to have been abandoned in a hurry, Schmitt continued, noting the infant car seat and what appears to be a bag packed for one of the children next to its bed.

A statement from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health issued in response to the video of the babies’ remains said Al-Nasr nursing staff were ordered to leave by the IDF, who told them the ICRC was coming to evacuate the patients.

“Instead, their decomposed bodies were found in their beds,” reads the statement. “These babies drew their last breaths alone and died alone.”

The ICRC told CNN it received “several requests” for evacuation from hospitals in the north of Gaza, but due to the “security situation” it was “not involved in any operations or evacuations, nor did teams commit to doing so.” The ICRC added the footage of the deceased children was an “unspeakable tragedy.”

301,US officials discuss post-war Gaza governance plans with Palestinian Authority and Arab nations,"Washington CNN —

US officials are discussing post-war Gaza governance plans with the Palestinian Authority along with regional US allies – making it a key focus as they try to look beyond the immediate conflict.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Friday afternoon with a delegation of Arab counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority, where the topic of Gaza after the Israeli offensive was expected to be a main point of discussion.

Shortly before the meeting began, the US vetoed a UN resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

A draft version of the resolution, presented by the United Arab Emirates, had called for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,” as well as “the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages” and “ensuring humanitarian access,” according to a draft copy.

The US was the lone veto. The UK abstained because the resolution did not condemn the October 7 Hamas attack.

When the war is over, US officials have said they ultimately envision both Gaza and the West Bank being ruled by a unified government led by a “revitalized” Palestinian Authority.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who initially rebuffed the idea of the PA ruling Gaza on the heels of the Israeli offensive, has shifted his position. Still, many questions remain about the immediate “day after” for Gaza once the war ends. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Wednesday that the US understands that there will be “some kind of transition period” in which Israeli forces remain in Gaza after the end of combat operations, but that cannot be permanent.

A Western diplomat told CNN that in past conversations the Arab delegation has made clear that they are not eager to be involved with an international force to provide security in Gaza after the war. The ministers have also said that if the world wants Arab states to play a role in reconstruction and support of the PA, there must be a path towards a Palestinian state.

At a press conference in Washington, DC, Friday, the delegation underscored that they were not willing to discuss the “day after” solely in the context of Gaza, but rather in the context of a Palestinian state.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi suggested on CNN they would not play a role in an international peacekeeping force, and condemned Israel’s offensive.

“All of us are losing our credibility,” he told Jim Sciutto on “CNN Newsroom” on Max.

“We are losing credibility in front of our people because our own people are looking at us and saying, ‘Okay, you’re demanding that Israel stop. It’s not. The whole international community has failed to act in any meaningful manner to stop the massacre,’” he said. “So. Everybody’s losing credibility. Moderation is losing credibility. The camp of peace is losing credibility. So that is a danger with which we we’re going to have to reckon at some point or the other.”

The delegation reiterated their call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and cast aspersions on members of the international community – like the US – for failing to advocate for one.

A senior administration official said that privately there is some consternation within the administration over the US’ Arab allies’ reluctance to play any role in a post-war international peacekeeping force, since they have been among the loudest in condemning Israel’s assault on Gaza. One Arab ambassador told CNN that their country would “absolutely not” place any of its own forces in Gaza after the war. Part of that is because the Arab states do not want to be seen as subjugating the Palestinians, the ambassador explained.

The Biden administration has consistently advocated for a two-state solution. Last month, Blinken laid out the administration’s terms for “durable peace and security” in Gaza after the war, which include no Israeli re-occupation and no reduction in territory. As such, the US is opposed to the establishment of an Israeli security buffer zone within Gaza after the war.

Vice President Kamala Harris also raised post-conflict Gaza in multiple meetings and calls with Arab leaders last weekend when in Dubai, telling reporters that she shared what expectations the US will have with regard to post-conflict planning.

“Specifically, I proposed three areas of focus,” Harris said, citing reconstruction of infrastructure in Gaza, reinforcing Palestinian Authority security and revitalizing PA governance. Harris also reiterated that a two-state solution is the best path forward.

Blinken met with Abbas in Ramallah last week. Harris’ national security adviser, Phil Gordon, held additional meetings in the West Bank this week.

“He underscored our commitment to the future establishment of a Palestinian state and made clear that the Palestinian people must have a hopeful political horizon. To that end, Dr. Gordon discussed the revitalization of the Palestinian Authority,” according to a White House readout.

It’s an extension of what US national security officials have telegraphed as it relates to Gaza and the PA.

“Leadership choices – these are, of course, up to the Palestinian people and Palestinians themselves. But there are a number of things that we think would be critical to making sure that, again, the Palestinian Authority can be effective in helping to advance the aspirations and the needs of its people,” Blinken said last week.

Deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said last month that the PA will “have to be part” of any future governing solution in both the West Bank and Gaza following the current hostilities – a prospect that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has explicitly opposed.

The senior administration official told CNN that the apparent disagreement between the US and Israel over a future role for the PA is overstated. The US agrees that the Palestinian Authority in its current, weakened state would be unlikely to be able to govern Gaza, but that a “revitalized” PA – including potentially with new leadership entirely – is a plausible solution.

Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told Bloomberg that he sees a role for Hamas in future Gaza governance – a prospect that would also be firmly rejected by Israel, whose stated goal is to eliminate the group. US officials have said there cannot be a return to the “status quo” before October 7. The Western diplomat told CNN that privately, many of the Arab partners also do not want Hamas to remain in control in Gaza.

It’s not clear that such an arrangement is even possible, given the long history of enmity between Hamas in Gaza and its bitter political rival Fatah, which controls the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The two sides have tried – and failed – multiple times to reach an agreement to unite the two separate Palestinian territories under one governance structure.

Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation agreement in Cairo in October 2017 under pressure from the Arab states, led by Egypt. Under the deal, a new unity government was supposed to take administrative control of Gaza two months later, ending a decade of rivalry that began when Hamas violently evicted the Palestinian Authority from Gaza in 2007.

But the deal’s lofty aspirations quickly collapsed. When Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah visited Gaza in March 2018, he was the target of an assassination attempt when a bomb detonated near his convoy. Hamdallah’s Fatah party immediately blamed Hamas for the attack.

302,Egypt’s president expected to secure third term as the world’s eyes are fixed on Gaza,"CNN —

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to secure his third term in power in a Sunday presidential election that critics have called a sham, as global attention is focused on the bloody war in neighboring Gaza.

The 69-year-old president has enjoyed two months of a pause in criticism from Western allies over his authoritarian rule and heightened crackdown on dissent, experts say, attributing the shift to Sisi’s renewed diplomatic relevance on the international stage due to the Israel-Hamas war.

Several top Western officials have paid Sisi visits since the war began, including United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

HA Hellyer, nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in London, said that Cairo has historically been “a critical interlocutor for the international community in general when it comes to the Arab-Israeli conflict.”

“As the Israeli-Palestinian question diminished in importance in many policy arenas, which was clearly a fundamentally flawed approach, so did Cairo’s geopolitical weight,” Hellyer told CNN, adding that with the Palestinian issue now prominently back in discussions, “there is a new prioritization internationally for good and comprehensive contact with Egypt.”

Egypt controls the Rafah crossing, the sole remaining link between the Gaza Strip – which Hamas controls – and the outside world. Egyptian officials have played mediation roles in previous wars between Israel and Hamas, as Cairo maintains diplomatic ties with both sides. During the current conflict, Egypt’s good offices have been used to deliver crucial aid into Gaza and to help secure the release of some of the hostages held there by Hamas since its militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting more than 240 others.

Egypt has also helped foreign nationals escape the carnage in Gaza, along with injured Palestinians. More than 17,000 Palestinians have so far been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which cites sources from the Hamas-controlled enclave. Aid has also been able to trickle into Gaza through Rafah.

Meanwhile, Sisi is moving to quietly secure another presidential term with little to no opposition at home or abroad, critics say.

“There are no elections. There is electoral theater,” Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington, DC, told CNN, citing the lack of viable opposition to Sisi.

The former field marshal rose to power in 2013 after overthrowing Mohamed Morsy, Egypt’s only democratically elected president, in a military coup. Sisi ran for president in 2014 and 2018, winning both elections with a sweeping majority. In 2019, his government passed constitutional amendments that permitted him to run for a third term.

“The terrible violence we’re witnessing (in Gaza) helped Sisi divide the attention of the public from their domestic concerns onto what’s happening, particularly the Palestinians in Gaza,” Kaldas said. “And as a result, somewhat reduce the level of focus on their own domestic plight, particularly their economic struggles.”

Egypt has also spent the past two months reminding its international partners of how “vitally important” it is, Kaldas said. Egypt can say: “See the useful role we play in negotiations and facilitation of the humanitarian assistance that needs to go to Gaza,” he added.

Sisi has appeared keen to capitalize on the crisis and present himself as a champion of the Palestinian cause. In a speech last month, the president repeated his call for a ceasefire, as well as his refusal of the “displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip,” calling such a prospect a red line.

While diplomats have been focused on Gaza, critics and human rights groups have lambasted Egypt over the past two months for what they say is its suppression of political dissent and silencing of opposition candidates.

Former lawmaker Ahmed el-Tantawy, who was the most prominent potential challenger to Sisi before he ended his campaign in October, said his supporters were restricted from registering their endorsements for him. He ended his campaign after failing to register the number of signatures required to run.

The Egyptian National Elections Authority (NEA) denied el-Tantawy’s claims, according to state media.

Three other candidates are running for president, with little support expected for each. These are the head of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, Farid Zahran; Wafd party nominee Abdel Sanad Yamama; and Republican Peoples’ Party candidate Hazem Omar.

Rights watchdog Amnesty International said last month that “genuine opposition candidates (were) barred from running” in Sunday’s election, adding that since October 1, Egyptian authorities “have arrested and interrogated at least 196 individuals due to their participation in unauthorized protests, as well as on allegations of engaging in terrorism-related activities and spreading ‘false news.’”

Amnesty also criticized Egypt’s prosecution of el-Tantawy, along with members of his campaign, which the rights group says are under fire “in retaliation for exercising their rights to political participation and to freedom of expression and association.”

El-Tantawy is accused of circulating election-related papers without the permission of the authorities. His trial date was pushed to January 9.

“Once more, the Egyptian authorities lay bare their utter intolerance for even the faintest whisper of dissent,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, as he urged the country to lift “sweeping restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.”

The Egyptian government’s foreign press center did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.

‘No one will come out to vote’

Just days before the election, streets in the capital, Cairo, were draped with large banners bearing Sisi’s portrait. An increased security presence is noticeable throughout the city, with officers and checkpoints dotting squares, highways and the entrances to bridges.

Among those boosting the pro-Sisi campaign is the Nation’s Future Party. “We are all with you” and “beloved of millions,” read the party’s pro-Sisi banners.

Despite the president’s high-profile election campaign, public sentiment is marked by frustration. Grievances regarding the economy are most evident.

Magdy Gerges, an Egyptian in his 50s who works as a driver, said economic hardships were painful, but that he feels a sense of security under Sisi’s rule.

“I’m one of those who suffer from the high prices, but this man (Sisi) gives me something more important than food; that I feel safe whenever my daughters go out,” Gerges told CNN. “By the end of the day, we will manage with our income, but what good is money if there is no security?” he said.

Gerges noted however that there are no other viable alternative candidates for voters to choose from, especially given the region’s precarious security situation.

“Even if we want to choose someone else, we have no alternative,” he said.

Another citizen, who asked to remain anonymous fearing reprisal from Egyptian authorities, questioned the legitimacy of Sunday’s election, saying polling stations will be empty since Sisi’s victory is clear.

“No one will come out to vote. People know the result in advance, so why this farce?” the man told CNN, saying it might have been better to “save these huge sums of money in the difficult economic conditions we are living in.”

Hellyer, of the Carnegie Endowment, said that with the current crisis in Gaza, Cairo might even see “potential for substantial economic assistance” from foreign nations, given the role it has played.

Egypt has been struggling to dig itself out of a debt hole that experts say requires structural reforms to avert economic collapse. Cairo’s allies in the Persian Gulf, who for years bailed out the most populous Arab nation, had in recent months criticized Egypt, saying the days of blank cheques are now over.

Egypt’s economic woes are far from resolved. Inflation is still high, and a foreign currency crisis remains unremedied. The country is also yet to meet the terms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $3 billion loan secured in December 2022 but which is yet to be disbursed.

Kaldas, of the Tahrir Institute, said that the Egyptian pound is expected to devalue further. The dollar now trades officially at 31 Egyptian pounds, and if the government decides to further devalue the exchange rate after the elections, that will translate to higher inflation, a deepening of economic hardship for individuals and businesses, and a rise in poverty, he said.

“There is no short-term scenario that doesn’t mean more economic pain for the average Egyptian,” Kaldas added.

The election takes place from December 10 to December 12. Results are expected by December 18.","['worlds', 'international', 'egyptian', 'economic', 'expected', 'sisi', 'egypt', 'opposition', 'eyes', 'egypts', 'president', 'gaza', 'term', 'cairo', 'election', 'secure', 'fixed']","CNN —Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to secure his third term in power in a Sunday presidential election that critics have called a sham, as global attention is focused on the bloody war in neighboring Gaza.

303,Harvard President apologizes for her comments during her congressional testimony in an interview with the student newspaper,"CNN —

The president of Harvard University apologized in an interview with the school’s student newspaper after facing widespread condemnation for her disastrous congressional testimony this week, in which she and other university presidents failed to explicitly say calls for genocide of Jewish people constituted bullying and harassment on campus.

“I am sorry,” Harvard University president Claudine Gay said to The Harvard Crimson on Thursday. “Words matter.”

The apology came just days after Gay, the president of the University of Pennsylvania and the president of MIT testified at a House committee hearing focused on antisemitism on campus, to widespread criticism that they have not done enough to ensure the safety of Jewish students and others at their respective schools.

Harvard, UPenn and MIT have all come under fire – along with other US academic institutions – over perceived inaction against antisemitism on their campuses, especially in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel and the subsequent war.

At UPenn, for example, President Liz Magill has been under pressure to resign for weeks, as major donors and others say they have lost confidence in her ability to lose the school.

Harvard is also among 14 colleges under investigation by the Department of Education “for discrimination involving shared ancestry” since the October attacks.

During Tuesday’s House hearing, Gay, along with the UPenn and MIT presidents, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

Gay told the Harvard student paper that she regretted what she said.

“When words amplify distress and pain, I don’t know how you could feel anything but regret,” she said to The Crimson.

“I got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures,” Gay told the newspaper. “What I should have had the presence of mind to do in that moment was return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our Jewish community — threats to our Jewish students — have no place at Harvard, and will never go unchallenged.”

“Substantively, I failed to convey what is my truth,” she added.

The Harvard president told the paper she’s heard about how much pain students are in over the past few months.

“To contemplate that something I said amplified that pain — that’s really difficult,” Gay said to The Crimson. “It makes me sad.”

Flood of criticism

Gay has faced plenty of calls to resign, most notably from Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, a Harvard graduate who has been a vocal critic of how universities have addressed antisemitism on campus

“Throughout the hearing, the three behaved like hostile witnesses,” Ackman wrote in a post on X earlier this week, “exhibiting a profound disdain for the Congress with their smiles and smirks, and their outright refusal to answer basic questions with a yes or no answer.”

“They must all resign in disgrace,” Ackman said.

But the criticism from donors, politicians, alumni and business leaders has been reserved mostly for UPenn’s Magill, who appears most imminently at risk of losing her job. She faces a donor rebellion, including a threat from one donor to pull a $100 million gift. The Wharton board also said it wants Magill ousted.

Underscoring the anger at the three university presidents’ testimony, on Friday a bipartisan group of more than 70 US lawmakers sent a letter to board members of all three universities, demanding the dismissal of Gay and the presidents of UPenn and MIT.

“Given this moment of crisis, we demand that your boards immediately remove each of these presidents from their positions and that you provide an actionable plan to ensure that Jewish and Israeli students, teachers, and faculty are safe on your campuses,” the lawmakers wrote.

“The university presidents’ responses to questions aimed at addressing the growing trend of antisemitism on college and university campuses were abhorrent,” the bipartisan group added.

Magill, like Gay, clarified her remarks Wednesday, a day after the controversial testimony. Magill said in a short video that she should have been more forceful in her condemnation of hate speech, particularly calls for genocide.

“I was not focused on – but I should have been – the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It’s evil. Plain, and simple,” Magill said in a video posted on X. “I want to be clear: A call for genocide of Jewish people … would be harassment or intimidation.”

Unlike Gay, however, Magill has not apologized for her testimony.","['gay', 'newspaper', 'comments', 'presidents', 'upenn', 'university', 'congressional', 'apologizes', 'student', 'president', 'testimony', 'jewish', 'students', 'harvard', 'interview', 'magill']","CNN —The president of Harvard University apologized in an interview with the school’s student newspaper after facing widespread condemnation for her disastrous congressional testimony this week, in which she and other university presidents failed to explicitly say calls for genocide of Jewish people constituted bullying and harassment on campus.

304,Rishi Sunak is picking a fight on the migration issue that he probably cannot win,"CNN —

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has a major problem.

As his governing Conservative Party prepares to enter what will likely be an election year in 2024, it is languishing behind the opposition Labour Party in polls week after week.

The Conservatives have been in power since 2010, during which time they’ve gone through five prime ministers and virtually every possible iteration of conservatism imaginable. And after 13 years in power, it’s fair to say the party looks a little tired and out of ideas.

This is why Sunak is leaning into the Conservatives’ historical trump card issue: immigration.

Sunak, himself the son of immigrants, is currently throwing absolutely everything he has at trying to bring down the UK’s net migration numbers – which reached a record high of 745,000 in 2022.

That high number exists for various reasons: The UK has had generous policies to welcome people fleeing Ukraine and Hong Kong in recent years.

Since leaving the European Union, the UK is no longer part of the Dublin Regulation, an EU law that is designed to share the burden of hosting asylum seekers across the bloc by allowing member states to return migrants to the EU country they first entered – something the UK used effectively and benefited from.

The implications of this can be seen most clearly in the number of people now crossing the English Channel in small boats.

The boats are largely run by criminal trafficking gangs who help migrants illegally enter the UK in unsafe, crowded vessels that have on multiple occasions led to people drowning.

While these small boats are not the chief reason for the UK’s immigration numbers, they arguably have the highest profile.

In 2018 , the number of people detected crossing the English Channel in small boats was 299, according to Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. In 2022, that number was 45,755.

Of course, 45,755 is a fraction of the 745,000 net immigration total. However, for the places that are most affected by these small boat landings, that enormous increase is very visible. For the people who live in areas where these migrants end up being housed while their asylum claims are processed, it is impossible not to notice the influx into local populations.

Politically, small boat crossings have become a touchstone issue for the next election – hence Sunak making stopping the boats one of his five key priorities at the start of this year.

He has inherited a controversial plan from his predecessors whereby the UK reached an agreement with Rwanda that refugees could be sent to that country instead of staying in the UK. To date, the UK has not sent a single person to Rwanda because courts have prevented them from doing so. Most notably, the European Court of Human Rights has blocked flights to Rwanda from taking off. In short, there are human rights concerns that people who are sent to Rwanda could still face oppression in Rwanda or be sent back to their country of origin.

Sunak this week unveiled a bill that was designed to block any legal reason that planes were not flying people to Rwanda. His immigration minister resigned hours later and it is possible that his government will lose a vote on the bill in parliament next week. Meanwhile it was revealed that the British government had paid the Rwandan government an additional £100m this year as part of the deal. It had already sent £140m to the country.

For a country that in 2016 voted to leave the European Union, a foreign court interfering with domestic law is something that creates political opportunities. Enter Nigel Farage.

Farage, one of the most high-profile Brexit campaigners, has been using his media profile and daily TV show to talk about small boats for a long time.

His tactic of attacking Sunak and the Conservatives from the right has over time forced some on the right of the Conservative Party to call for increasingly tough action on immigration. Some even think there is an argument for the UK leaving the ECHR. And with an election coming up, some are even wondering if promising some kind of referendum on the UK’s membership of the ECHR in the Conservative manifesto might be a way of keeping voters who are tempted to cast their ballots for smaller right-wing parties.

Indeed, Sunak’s recently-sacked home secretary said in a statement to parliament earlier this week: “The powers to detain and remove must be exercisable notwithstanding the Human Rights Act, the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention, and all other international law … it is now or never. The Conservative Party faces electoral oblivion in a matter of months if we introduce yet another Bill destined to fail. Do we fight for sovereignty or let our party die?”

If this all sounds familiar, that’s because it’s all happened before. It was Farage’s Euroskeptic rabble-rousing that forced former Conservative leader David Cameron to put a Brexit vote in his party’s 2015 manifesto. Cameron won that election, but was forced to resign a year later after losing the referendum. Sunak can at least ask Cameron for advice, having recently made him the UK’s foreign secretary.

While Cameron has been publicly supportive of Sunak’s Rwanda plan and the bill introduced this week, it’s not hard to imagine him telling his boss that on Europe and immigration, the Conservatives simply cannot win.

The reality is that the bar set by Farage and some of his own MPs is so high that there is no way Sunak can clear it. Whatever he does, it will never be enough for the voters most-motivated by migration.

On the left – which in modern British politics can at times really mean center-right – Sunak risks looking cruel, kicking down at people who are fleeing war zones and trying to send them to a place where they are still not safe.

Sunak is desperate to flip the debate over to Labour, forcing them to take a position on immigration – but this issue is intensely toxic for Conservatives. There will always be people with the luxury of sitting outside of mainstream politics who can make noise.

And beside all of this, British attitudes to migration have evolved in the past few years – the idea of simply being strong on immigration winning votes for the Conservatives is not as true as it once was.

Some who saw it as a key issue now recognize that the health service benefited from migrant labor. Some feel post-Brexit that their concerns were addressed and that the country now has control over immigration. There are still people who care a lot about migration, of course, but the general direction of travel is that views are softening.

Given the difficult position he’s in, it’s no surprise that Sunak is looking for wedge issues ahead of the next election. But it might be that the PM has picked a fight he simply can’t win.","['rishi', 'rwanda', 'fight', 'immigration', 'party', 'sunak', 'picking', 'week', 'migration', 'small', 'conservatives', 'uk', 'boats', 'issue', 'probably', 'win', 'sent']","The implications of this can be seen most clearly in the number of people now crossing the English Channel in small boats.

305,Bear attacks in Japan are at a record high. Climate change and an aging population are making the problem worse,"Tokyo CNN —

Seishi Sato had an ominous feeling when he saw something rustling in a bush during a recent stroll in a forest in northern Japan.

Before he knew it, two Asiatic bears had sprung from the shrub, one charging at him as he frantically tried to fend it off while fearing for his life.

“When I saw them, I was so close and I thought I was in deep trouble,” the 57-year-old from Iwate prefecture, in northeast Japan, told CNN.

He survived the attack — but not without plenty of scratches and puncture wounds on his arm and thigh.

Sato is among at least 212 people who survived what has been a record year for bear attacks in Japan, according to the Ministry of Environment. Six people have died.

With a month of 2023 still to go, this year’s total has already far surpassed the 158 that took place throughout the whole of 2020 (the previous record year). And the number of bear attacks have never exceeded 200 per year since record began in 2006.

Sightings of “kuma”, or bears, are not unusual in Japan but are generally concentrated in the northern part of the country, where mountain ranges, lush bush and crystal-clear rivers provide an ideal habitat and abundant sources of the acorns, beechnuts, fruits and insects that make up their diet.

But experts say Japan’s bears are increasingly venturing out of their traditional habitats and into urban areas in search of food. Some suggest this is because climate change is interfering with the flowering and pollination of some of the animals’ traditional sources of food.

“Bears are expanding their home range this year and are coming down to areas near human settlements in search of food,” said associate professor Maki Yamamoto, who studies bears at the Nagaoka University of Technology in Niigata.

Increasingly, this is bringing them into the paths of people like Sato, who was attacked just a half-hour walk from the shop he runs, where he sells pet supplies and mushrooms he picks from the forest.

“People are becoming very alert to this situation,” said Sato, adding that other residents had been attacked outside the front doors of their village homes.

As of November, there had been 19,191 sightings across the country, up from 11,135 sightings throughout the whole of the previous year and 12,743 in 2021.

Iwate, where Sato lives, has logged more cases than anywhere else - 5,158 – followed by its neighboring prefecture of Akita, which has reported 3,000 sightings.

So pressing has the issue become that Environment Minister Shintaro Ito pledged last month to help affected communities.

“We are considering providing emergency assistance to local communities in response to their needs, such as surveying and capturing bears living in the vicinity of human settlements, taking into consideration the wishes of prefectures where human casualties due to bears are particularly on the rise,” he told a press conference.

Protective mama bears

Japan is home to two main types of bear: brown bears, which live in Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan’s main islands, and a small population of Asiatic bears, which reside in Honshu, Japan’s largest island.

Both breeds have an omnivorous diet, enjoy feeding on acorns and tend to avoid humans if possible. An Asiatic bear weighs between 40 and 100 kg while a Japanese brown bear can grow up to 400kg. But both are far from being the biggest bear on earth. Kodiak Brown Bears in Alaska, for example, can weigh up to 600kg.

“Both brown bears and Asiatic black bears are basically timid animals that avoid people,” said Professor Koji Yamazaki from the Tokyo University of Agriculture.

When bears do attack, the cause is usually because a mother bear fears an encounter with a human poses a threat to her cub, experts said.

Sato, who runs the YouTube channel Primitive Forest Bear to share his adventures in nature, recalled that the Asiatic bears he ran into appeared to be mother and child.

He captured the attack on camera and posted the video online as a reminder to others to take care.

The video, which has since gone viral, shows him screaming for his life and hitting the animal with a tree branch to drive it away. At one point, he climbs a tree to avoid being mauled. Luckily, the bear eventually turns away.

“When I saw the video, I was scared to death,” Sato said.

Climate change and population shifts

With encounters on the increase, some experts believe climate change may be a factor in pushing bears further from their traditional habitats.

“The thing is that you can have years of bad harvests and years of good harvest of acorns. And when the harvest is bad, the bears cannot store enough energy before hibernation by eating mountain acorns alone, so they get closer to human settlements looking for fruits, chestnuts, persimmons, walnuts, and farm products in general,” Yamamoto, from Nagaoka University of Technology, explained.

“This year, bears have been appearing more in the villages precisely because of the very bad harvest of acorns from the beech, the bears’ favorite tree,” she said.

Tsutomu Mano, a senior research fellow at the Hokkaido Research Organization, said climate change “is likely to have a significant impact on the flowering time of plants and the activity of insects responsible for pollination, which is necessary for fruiting.”

And when the bears don’t have enough food, they often turn to human neighborhoods to look for leftovers in the bins, he said.

Once they’ve developed a taste for human leftovers they will keep returning for more, Mano said.

Another factor that some believe may be coming into play is Japan’s rapidly shifting demographics.

With a median age of 48, Japan has one of the world’s oldest populations, according to the Economic and Social for Asia and the Pacific, a United Nations’ arm that tracks population trends.

At the same time, the country is experiencing a shift in which younger generations are increasingly moving to big cities for better job opportunities.

Taken together, the two factors mean populations on the rural edges of northern prefectures are fast dwindling, creating conditions such as “abandonment of cultivated land and overgrowth along riversides” that “make it easier for bears to enter,” according to Mano.

According to national broadcaster NHK, out of the 71 people attacked by bears in October, 61 were above the age of 60. Twenty-one people were in their 80s.

On October 24 alone, four people – all in the 70s – were injured in Akita on the same day, the broadcaster reported.

What’s the solution?

At Karuizawa, a resort town located in Nagano prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, conservationists have taken to patrolling the forest with dogs to scare the bears away, according to local media.

But officials in Akita prefecture, which recorded the second-highest number of bear attacks, have a more drastic measure in store. They have begun offering rewards to trappers.

Governor Norihisa Satake announced late last month a 5,000-yen ($33) prize for each bear captured in the prefecture. The authorities are also mulling a proposal to set aside a fund of up to 15 million yen ($100,000) to pay for the transportation of the captured bears.

But experts say a more holistic approach is needed.

“Trapping is not sufficient to manage bears, so it is necessary to consider a combination of various methods,” said Yamazaki, from the Tokyo University of Agriculture.

The first step was to study what types of bear – in terms of their ages, genders and locations - were going astray and why, he said.","['record', 'sato', 'brown', 'making', 'climate', 'japan', 'population', 'problem', 'high', 'bear', 'bears', 'asiatic', 'university', 'change', 'prefecture', 'human', 'worse', 'acorns']","Before he knew it, two Asiatic bears had sprung from the shrub, one charging at him as he frantically tried to fend it off while fearing for his life.

306,Six French teenagers convicted in connection with 2020 beheading of teacher Paty,"CNN —

A French court on Friday convicted six teenagers in connection with the 2020 beheading of history teacher Samuel Paty, whose murder shocked the country.

The teacher had shown his pupils caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression, angering some Muslim parents. Most Muslims avoid depictions of prophets, considering them to be blasphemous.

Among those on trial was a teenage girl who had allegedly told her parents that Paty had asked Muslim pupils to leave the room before showing the caricatures.

The court found her guilty of having made false accusation charges and slanderous comments, as it was established that she was not in the class at the time.

The other adolescents were found guilty of charges related to taking part in a pre-meditated criminal conspiracy and helping to prepare an ambush.

Paty, 47, was killed outside his school in a Paris suburb by an 18-year-old assailant of Chechen origin, who was shot dead by police soon after the attack.

The court found those adolescents guilty of having pointed out Paty to the murderer.

Louis Cailliez, lawyer for Paty’s sister Mickaelle, told reporters his client was “satisfied with the full conviction,” but less so with the sentences, that she found “too lenient”.

Dylan Slama, a lawyer for one of the teenagers, said that though it was hard to talk about satisfaction in such tragic circumstances, there was a sense of relief for his client.

The heaviest sentence was given to an adolescent who was formally given a 6-month prison sentence, although he should be able to serve this at home while under electronic surveillance.

The girl who was found guilty of making false accusations and slanderous comments was given an 18-month suspended sentence and put on probation measures for two years.

All six teenagers’ suspended sentences are tied to them following a strict set of probation measures for two to three years.

Another trial in connection with Paty’s killing, involving adults this time, is set to take place at the end of next year.","['french', 'paty', 'teacher', 'trial', 'given', 'court', 'suspended', 'beheading', 'guilty', 'teenagers', 'told', '2020', 'convicted', 'connection', 'sentence']","CNN —A French court on Friday convicted six teenagers in connection with the 2020 beheading of history teacher Samuel Paty, whose murder shocked the country.

307,Appeals court maintains most of Trump gag order in federal election subversion case,"CNN —

An appeals court has largely upheld the gag order against former President Donald Trump in the federal election subversion case, saying he can be barred from talking about witnesses as well as prosecutors, the court staff and their family members.

But the court said the gag order does not apply to comments made about special counsel Jack Smith and narrows the prohibition Trump had for speaking about witnesses in the case, a change from the original gag order.

The decision against Trump is a striking admonishment for an ex-president facing an upcoming criminal trial, but also makes clear Trump is still allowed to criticize President Joe Biden and the Justice Department and to argue the prosecution “is politically motivated or that he is innocent of the charges against him.”

The three appeals court judges who issued Friday’s ruling — Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard and Bradley Garcia, all Democratic appointees — found Trump’s words on the public stage could undermine the fairness of a jury trial, sway or intimidate witnesses and imperil court staff. The court said that justifies limiting Trump’s speech, even while he campaigns to return to the presidency.

It is the second time in recent weeks that an appeals court has reinstated limits on what Trump can say publicly. Trump’s also under a gag order in New York barring him from attacking court staff in a civil fraud trial against him and his business there. Trump is set to testify in that case on Monday.

Trump vowed to appeal the decision in a social media post on Friday.

Friday’s lengthy opinion came from all three judges who heard Trump’s appeal at the DC Circuit Court nearly two weeks ago, and was written by Millett.

“Mr. Trump’s documented pattern of speech and its demonstrated real-time, real-world consequences pose a significant and imminent threat to the functioning of the criminal trial process in this case,” the appeals court wrote.

The court said that Trump’s campaign for the 2024 presidency “does not alter the court’s historical commitment or obligation to ensure the fair administration of justice in criminal cases.”

“We do not allow such an order lightly. Mr. Trump is a former President and current candidate for the presidency, and there is a strong public interest in what he has to say,” the court said.

“But Mr. Trump is also an indicted criminal defendant, and he must stand trial in a courtroom under the same procedures that govern all other criminal defendants. That is what the rule of law means.”

Court cites Trump’s attacks on Meadows and Pence

In explaining their decision, the appeals court pointed to the former president’s many public statements and attacks against witnesses in the case, including former chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Vice President Mike Pence.

The court said that such statements “pose a significant” risk that witnesses would be intimidated and “unduly influenced” in the case. Some witnesses have “had their lives turned upside down after coming within Mr. Trump’s verbal sights,” the court wrote.

The court also noted that Trump is subject to release conditions barring him from direct communication with witnesses.

That prohibition “would mean little if he can evade it by making the same statements to a crowd, knowing or expecting that a witness will get the message,” the court wrote.

The risk to witnesses “is largely irreversible in the age of the Internet,” the court noted. “Once an individual is publicly targeted, even revoking the offending statement may not abate the subsequent threats, harassment, or other intimidating effects during the pretrial as well as trial stages of this case.”

The court also noted Trump’s public statement shortly after being charged in the case, “If go after me, I’m coming after you,” as a broadly threatening message toward people working on the case, and said his “messaging [was] daggered at likely witnesses and their testimony.”

Trump is still able to publicly share opinions about witnesses who include several high-profile critics of his who served in his presidential administration.

Trial delay would ‘simply compound the problem’

In the ruling Friday, the appeals court pushed back forcefully against Trump’s argument that his criminal trial should be delayed until after the 2024 presidential election as an alternative to limiting his speech, writing that it would be “counterproductive, create perverse incentives, and unreasonably burden the judicial process.”

Trump has repeatedly argued in court that his criminal trial in the election interference case, which is scheduled for March, should be delayed until after the November presidential election. So far, all of his efforts have been rejected.

“Allowing prejudicial statements to go unchecked for an even longer pre-trial period would simply compound the problem,” the appeals court wrote.

The court also said that allowing the former president’s threatening speech to “override the district court’s control and management of the trial schedule” would incentivize other criminal defendants to also say or post harmful things as a means of delaying their own prosecutions.

The gag order doesn’t prohibit Trump from making any comments but rather statements “made with the intent to materially interfere” with the case. For instance, Trump can publicly speak about witnesses, the appeals court said, but not about their “potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding.”

The appeals court said his words about possible witnesses would have to be looked at in context.

“That allows the former President to continue to speak out about those same persons’ books, articles, editorials, interviews, or political campaigns as long as he does so in a manner that does not concern their roles as witnesses or the content of any expected testimony,” the court wrote.

In addition, the court strongly backed his ability to disparage the special counsel.

“As a high-ranking government official who exercises ultimate control over the conduct of this prosecution, the Special Counsel is no more entitled to protection from lawful public criticism than is the institution he represents,” the court wrote.

308,"Ryan O’Neal, star of ‘Love Story’ and ‘Peyton Place,’ dead","CNN —

Oscar-nominated actor Ryan O’Neal, star of several landmark films including “Love Story” and “Paper Moon,” has died, according to his son, Patrick, who posted the news to social media. He was reportedly 82.

“My dad passed away peacefully today, with his loving team by his side supporting him and loving him as he would us,” Patrick O’Neal wrote on Friday.

He added: “My father Ryan O’Neal has always been my hero. I looked up to him and he was always bigger than life.”

CNN has reached out to a representative for Ryan O’Neal.

Ryan O’Neal’s breakout role came in 1964 on the nighttime soap opera “Peyton Place.”

A Hollywood “Love Story”

After starring in several TV shows throughout the 1960s, O’Neal made an indelible mark on the movies in the 1970 adaptation of the Erich Segal novel “Love Story,” in which he starred opposite Ali MacGraw. The tearjerker film told the story of a wealthy Ivy Leaguer (Ryan O’Neal) who marries an outspoken and irreverent girl (MacGraw), only to watch her die of a terminal illness. Among other things, it popularized the line, “Love means never having to say you’re sorry.”

The film was a huge hit, providing a major boost to Paramount Pictures (which was being run by MacGraw’s then-husband, Robert Evans), and while it established Ryan O’Neal as a classic leading man – and earned him an Oscar nomination in the process – he also found success in comedy, playing opposite Barbra Streisand in “What’s Up, Doc?” and “The Main Event.”

On X (formerly Twitter), Streisand said she was “sad” to hear the news of the actor’s death.

“He was funny and charming, and he will be remembered,” she wrote.

Ryan O’Neal later starred in a “Love Story” sequel called “Oliver’s Story,” which flopped at the box office.

The actor’s eclectic resume included starring with his daughter, Tatum O’Neal, in “Paper Moon,” for which she won an Academy Award for best supporting actress; and the Stanley Kubrick-directed period piece “Barry Lyndon.”

Off screen, O’Neal had a long relationship with actress and pin-up model Farrah Fawcett, which provided endless fodder for the tabloids. The relationship followed earlier marriages to actresses Joanna Moore and Leigh Taylor-Young.

Born in Los Angeles, O’Neal trained to become a professional boxer before he began to pursue acting, appearing in several TV westerns, and eventually landing his regular role on “Peyton Place.”

O’Neal’s more recent credits included recurring roles on the TV shows “Bones” and “Bull,” along with appearances on “Desperate Housewives” and the reboot “90210.”

Strained relationship

Ryan O’Neal and his daughter Tatum O’Neal’s off-screen relationship was strained for many years.

She had struggled with addiction, and in 2011, the father and daughter starred in the reality series “Ryan and Tatum: The O’Neals” on OWN.

A clip of that show was featured that year during a Tatum O’Neal appearance on CNN.

“How would I feel if my father were to, say, get sick or die even? Would I be OK? And I realized that I wouldn’t be OK,” she said in the clip. “So I knew I needed to make an effort, because what is your life without your family? What’s your life without a father?”

In 2020, Tatum O’Neal’s son shared on social media that the family had reconciled.

The actor had four children. In addition to Tatum O’Neal, he had a son, Griffin O’Neal, with Moore. He also had a son, Redmond James O’Neal, with Fawcett. Patrick O’Neal, a sportscaster, was from his marriage with Taylor-Young.

His brother, actor Kevin O’Neal, died earlier this year.

310,European Union agrees to regulate AI development,"CNN —

European Union lawmakers struck a deal Friday agreeing to one of the world’s first major comprehensive artificial intelligence laws.

The landmark legislation, called the AI Act, sets up a regulatory framework to promote the development of AI while addressing the risks associated with the rapidly evolving technology. The legislation bans harmful AI practices “considered to be a clear threat to people’s safety, livelihoods and rights.”

The law comes amid growing fears about the disruptive capabilities of artificial intelligence.

In a news conference, Roberta Metsola, the president of the European Parliament, called the law “a balanced and human-centered approach” that will “no doubt be setting the global standard for years to come.”

The regulatory framework, which classifies AI uses by risk and increases regulation on higher risk levels, was first proposed in 2021.

The riskiest uses for AI are banned. According to the law, those include systems that exploit specific vulnerable groups, biometric identification systems for law enforcement purposes and artificial intelligence that deploys manipulative “subliminal techniques.”

Limited risk systems, such as chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, or technology that generates images, audio or video content, are subject to new transparency obligations under the law.

“The #AIAct is much more than a rulebook – it’s a launchpad for EU startups and researchers to lead the global AI race,” Thierry Breton, the EU Commissioner for Internal Market, wrote on social media. “The best is yet to come.”

Artificial intelligence broke into the mainstream with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. Seemingly overnight, generative AI technology exploded in popularity and spurred an AI arms race.

But AI’s disruption reaches far beyond the world of big tech: Educators have struggled with generative AI’s ability to complete schoolwork assignments; artists and musicians have grappled with the potential for AI-fueled imitation; and even the media industry has seen its controversies.

Some of the companies behind the technology have experienced growing pains, as well.

OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, was briefly ousted and then reinstated over the course of a few drama-filled days in November – with the exact reasons for the leadership changes still unclear, weeks later.

311,Tomato lost in space by history-making astronaut has been found,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Perhaps nowhere in the universe is a fresh, ripe tomato more valuable than on the International Space Station, where astronauts live for months at a time subsisting mainly on prepackaged, shelf-stable goods.

That’s why astronaut Frank Rubio became the central figure in a lighthearted whodunnit that has taken months to solve.

After Rubio harvested one of the first tomatoes ever grown in space earlier this year, according to the astronaut, he admitted he misplaced it.

“I put it in a little bag, and one of my crewmates was doing a (public) event with some schoolkids, and I thought it’d be kind of cool to show the kids — ‘Hey guys this is the first tomato harvested in space,’” Rubio said during an October media event. “I was pretty confident that I Velcroed it where I was supposed to Velcro it … and then I came back and it was gone.”

In the microgravity environment of space, anything not anchored to a wall is at risk of floating away — destined to spend eternity hidden behind a nook or cranny within the football field-size orbiting laboratory and its labyrinthian passageways.

Rubio said he probably spent eight to 20 hours of his own free time just searching for that tomato.

“Unfortunately — because that’s just human nature — a lot of people are like, ‘He probably ate the tomato,’” Rubio said. “And I wanted to find it mostly so I could prove like I did not eat the tomato.”

But he never found it.

Rubio returned to Earth on September 27 with the precious produce still lost aboard the space station.

It remained lost — until now.

During a Wednesday news conference, members of the seven-person crew remaining on the space station revealed they had finally located the tomato.

Rubio had “been blamed for quite a while for eating the tomato,” NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli said. “But we can exonerate him.”

Tomato on top of a historic mission

The astronauts did not reveal where the tomato was or specify what state the produce was in when found.

Rubio surmised in October that it had probably already shriveled into an unrecognizable rot.

Due to the humidity at the space station, “it probably desiccated to the point where you couldn’t tell what it was,” Rubio said.

Case closed.

Rubio’s return to Earth in September was a historic moment. His stay on the space station — which lasted more than a year — set a record for the longest a US astronaut has ever spent in microgravity.

Rubio originally expected to spend only six months aboard the International Space Station. Instead, he logged 371 days following the discovery of a coolant leak coming from his original ride — a Russian Soyuz spacecraft — while it was docked to the orbiting outpost.

In his October interview, Rubio acknowledged how arduous moments of the journey were.

“I kind of allowed myself a day to feel sad and sorry for myself, and then I try to really make a conscious decision to say OK let’s have a good attitude and let’s just try to do the best job possible,” Rubio said of learning his stay would be extended by another six months.

312,"Three dead in outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, CDC warns","CNN —

An outbreak of the tickborne disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever has caused at least five illnesses, including three deaths, in the US since July, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Friday.

The five cases were identified in Southern California and involved people who had traveled to Tecate, Baja California, in the previous two weeks. Four were under age 18, and three were US residents, the agency said in a health alert. All five were hospitalized, and three died.

The CDC is warning health care providers that if a patient has symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and has recently traveled to northern Mexico, they should consider starting treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline right away, rather than waiting for test results to confirm the condition.

“RMSF is a severe, rapidly progressive, and often deadly disease transmitted by the bite of infected ticks, although many patients do not recall being bitten by a tick,” the agency notes. It’s endemic in northern Mexico and in parts of the southwestern US, where it can be transmitted by brown dog ticks. It does not spread from person to person.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Signs of infection can be mild in the first few days, including a low fever, headache, stomach problems, abdominal pain, rash and swelling around the eyes and on the back of the hands. On or after about five days, someone may develop changes in mental state, coma, brain swelling, respiratory problems and multiorgan damage. It’s fatal in 5% to 10% of cases, with about half of those deaths happening within eight days of the onset of illness.

Anyone who’s traveled to northern Mexico and develops symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever within two weeks of their return to the US should get medical attention right away, the CDC says.

313,Billionaire Ken Langone is latest GOP megadonor to endorse Nikki Haley,"CNN —

Billionaire Ken Langone on Friday endorsed Nikki Haley’s presidential bid in the latest sign of the Republican moneyed class rallying behind her as the main alternative to Donald Trump in the GOP primary.

“I think she is just what we need right now. I think her approach is smart. I think she’s qualified,” Langone said on Fox News. “More importantly, I think the American people need this kind of leadership – statesmanlike, elegant. Just think of … where we have been in the last six or seven or eight years. It is not good at all.”

Langone, a co-founder of Home Depot, is the latest in a growing list of wealthy donors to back the former South Carolina governor. The network associated with billionaire Charles Koch announced its support for her last week, as did North Carolina retail magnate Art Pope. Earlier this week, LinkedIn co-founder and billionaire Democratic donor Reid Hoffman gave $250,000 to support her campaign.

Langone said that while he likes GOP contender Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor’s “numbers aren’t moving.”

“The writing is on the wall,” Langone told Fox News. “On the other hand, Nikki Haley has had a substantial upswing. The one thing I’m committed to is we have to beat Joe Biden. If Joe Biden is going to be the nominee, we have to beat him. We can’t take any more of this mayhem.”

Asked why he didn’t endorse Trump, Langone said the former president’s time has “come and gone” and condemned his actions toward the end of his White House tenure.

“What Trump put this country through the last three months of his presidency was disgraceful,” Langone said.

“I think what happened on January 6 – all he had to say is ‘Please go home.’ … But he sat in a room and watched it for three hours and did nothing about it and America deserves better than that,” he added.","['joe', 'endorse', 'megadonor', 'think', 'gop', 'support', 'trump', 'week', 'nikki', 'haley', 'langone', 'latest', 'need', 'billionaire', 'ken']","CNN —Billionaire Ken Langone on Friday endorsed Nikki Haley’s presidential bid in the latest sign of the Republican moneyed class rallying behind her as the main alternative to Donald Trump in the GOP primary.

Both women have been successful performers for decades, endorsing each other’s artistry along the way. But many of their supporters and cultural critics continue to compare their careers, along with how their work is received and acknowledged.

The latest example was the reception this week to Swift being named Time’s 2023 Person of the Year. New York Times bestselling author and cultural critic Luvvie Ajayi Jones noted Beyoncé’s omission from the list of individuals considered.

“Taylor being TIME person of the year while Beyoncé was not even nominated when they had VERY comparable years in terms quantifiable impact is actually wild,” Ajayi Jones wrote on Instagram.

“They both had record-breaking sold out world tours and BOTH shifted economies ad BOTH had documentaries come out,” she continued. “ONE of them was crowned the PERSON OF THE YEAR. While the other was not even considered for the title.”

Swift’s “Eras Tour” reportedly grossed more than an estimated $1 billion, while Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” tour reportedly grossed an estimated $570 million. However, she had 56 tour dates compared to Swift’s 146.

“Whether or not you are BeyHive [the term for her hardcore fans] or can’t stand her, you cannot deny the obvious erasure,” Ajayi Jones added. “Because there is only ONE main thing that makes her and Taylor different. You can be one of the most influential women in the world, and because you’re Black you can still be locked out.”

Other well known people, including journalist Cari Champion, responded with support in Ajayi Jones’ comments on the post.

“When tell you that YOU always have the time and you are ON TIME,” Champion remarked.

TV personality and author Nicole Waters commented, “She’s won everything and still can’t win. We thank God she doesn’t measure her worth by accolades issued by ‘not us.’ And that’s the lesson.”

For some, the selection of Swift is a continuation of the debate about industry disparities between Black and white artists and how their work is valued.

In 2017, there were accusations of racism after Adele topped Beyoncé in the album of the year category at the Grammy awards.

Yet the argument can be made that far from allowing issues of race to hold her back, Beyoncé has used it to fuel her art (see “Lemonade,” “Black Is King” and “Renaissance” for confirmation of that). It also bears mention that while she has not yet won an album of the year Grammy, Beyoncé holds the all-time record for most Grammy wins by a single artist with 32.

So while comparisons between the two artists may continue, the women themselves have only shown each other love.

Taylor Swift pushes back on comparing tours

In her interview with Time, Swift called out those who would position her in competition with Beyoncé.

“There were so many stadium tours this summer, but the only ones that were compared were me and Beyoncé,” Swift said. “Clearly it’s very lucrative for the media and stan culture to pit two women against each other, even when those two artists in question refuse to participate in that discussion.”

She also hailed Bey, saying “She’s the most precious gem of a person — warm and open and funny.”

“And she’s such a great disrupter of music-industry norms,” Swift said. “She taught every artist how to flip the table and challenge archaic business practices.”

Both artists recently released films documenting their tours and attended the film premieres for the other.

In October, Swift gushed about Beyoncé showing up for the premiere for her “Eras Tour” concert film in Los Angeles.

“I’m so glad I’ll never know what my life would’ve been like without @beyonce’s influence. The way she’s taught me and every artist out here to break rules and defy industry norms,” Swift wrote in the caption of a video posted on social media showing the two of them inside of the theater. “Her generosity of spirit. Her resilience and versatility. She’s been a guiding light throughout my career and the fact that she showed up tonight was like an actual fairytale.”

Swift returned the gesture the following month, when Beyoncé’s film premiered in London.

Beyoncé literally gives Swift her flowers

In 2021, both women had a big night at the Grammys.

Swift won album of the year for “Folklore” and Beyoncé notched her 28th Grammy, becoming the most Grammy-winning female artist of all time.

The latter sent the former a beautiful bouquet of flowers with a note that read, “Congratulations on your Grammy. It was great seeing you on Sunday night. Thank you for always being so supportive. Sending love to you and your family. B.”

Swift shared a photo of the flowers and note on social media writing, “Woke up to flowers from the queen of grace & greatness @beyonce and suddenly it’s the best Friday EVER. Thank you B and congratulations on your epic achievement Sunday night!!”

Beyoncé shares the stage with Swift

Kanye West leaping on stage to hijack Swift’s win for best female video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards has gone down in pop culture history.

West grabbed the microphone and said, “Yo Taylor, I’m really happy for you. Imma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!”

The camera panned to Bey in the audience, looking flabbergasted.

Later, when Bey’s “Single Ladies” won for video of the year she brought Swift out to have the moment she had earlier been denied.

“I remember being 17 years old up for my first MTV Award with Destiny’s Child and it was one of the most exciting moments in my life,” Beyoncé said. “So I’d lke for Taylor to come out and have her moment.”

Afterwards Swift had nothing but praise for what she had done.

“They told me to stand by the side of the stage and I didn’t really know what was going to go down, but I thought it was so wonderful and gracious of her to do what she’s always done,” Rolling Stone reported Swift as saying at the time. “She’s always been a great person before anything else. Before the talented artist, the superstar, she’s always been a great person and I just, I thought I couldn’t love Beyoncé more tonight, then tonight happened and it was just wonderful.”

That love clearly couldn’t be more mutual.","['suggest', 'shes', 'artist', 'try', 'tour', 'women', 'taylor', 'beyoncé', 'grammy', 'won', 'person', 'swift', 'rivalry']","CNN —Beyoncé vs Taylor Swift is less about them than it is about a larger discussion about erasure and ethnicity.

315,Prevent injuries by avoiding these common exercise errors,"Editor’s note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.

CNN —

It’s a frustrating irony that exercise — so critical to good health and longevity — also has the potential to cause harm.

Some 3.6 million people were treated in emergency departments in 2022 for various injuries involving sports and recreational equipment, according to the National Safety Council. Topping the list? Injuries from exercise and exercise equipment, which accounted for 445,642 of those emergency department visits.

Whether you’re just starting out or rebooting a fitness routine, many injuries can be prevented with a little awareness and caution, according to experts.

“One of the biggest mistakes I see is doing too much, too soon,” said Dr. Alex McDonald, a family and sports medicine physician and assistant professor of clinical science at the Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine in Pasadena, California.

McDonald said such overexercising often occurs when someone decides to begin a new exercise regimen. “But they overestimate what they can do, then get injured or quit,” he said.

Exercising should be thought of as a long game, said Lisa Herrington, a certified personal trainer in Davis, California, and cofounder of Fit House Davis. “It should not be an all-or-nothing mentality,” she said. “A little every day goes a long way.”

Be mindful of form

Using proper form when exercising is also critical, whether you’re using a piece of gym equipment or engaging in activities such as running or cycling.

“Having good form always trumps speed, weight or strength,” McDonald said. “If you have bad form, you’re not getting the full benefit of the workout, and are potentially straining other muscles and ligaments that you’re not supposed to be using.”

One common example of bad form is hanging on, or leaning over, the handrails on treadmills and elliptical machines.

“People often hang on the handrails when they’re getting tired, instead of slowing down,” Herrington said. “But handrails are supposed to help with your workout, not be a rest aid. If you’re hanging on the equipment or leaning over the bars, back off the pace or incline.”

Herrington also frequently sees people leaning too hard on bike handlebars during the spin classes she teaches, which can result in sore necks and shoulders.

“People get tired during the sprints, so all of their body weight goes into the handlebars,” she said. “They should really take a seat for a few seconds and then sprint again.”

To ensure you’re using proper form, both McDonald and Herrington said it’s best to enlist the help of a professional, such as a personal trainer or physical therapist. They are the experts, plus it’s hard to evaluate yourself.

What’s more, you carry your body differently as you age. So even if your form was great several years ago, you may need some tweaks for the body you have today.

Cycling: Proper bike setup

Cycling may seem like a straightforward exercise, but it can cause injuries, too. A frequent misstep when cycling is having an incorrect seat height.

If your bike seat is too low or high, you may develop knee or lower-back pain, as your knee angle will be altered with each pedal stroke.

Your bike seat, or saddle, should be even with your hip bone when standing next to it.

When sitting on the bike and taking your feet off the pedals, your toes should be the only thing touching the floor.

Running: Don’t overdo it

Runners are at risk of goofs such as overstriding, poor gait and overtraining.

Overstriding, a common running error, occurs when you land with your foot too far in front of your hips or knees. Doing so puts you at risk for stress- and joint-related issues. Increasing your cadence, or the frequency of your steps, lowers the high impact of running, which may reduce injuries, according to a 2021 study. Greater step frequency also combats overstriding, as you have to take shorter steps.

To see if you may have gait issues, check the bottoms of your running shoes, McDonald said. If your heels or the outsides of your shoes are quite worn, it could indicate you’re landing too forcefully and frequently in less-optimal spots.

“A lot of running stores can video you running and do a gait analysis,” he said. “Physical therapists provide this service as well. Small tweaks in your gait can make a big difference when you’re talking about preventing a repetitive injury.”

Vary your movement

Overtraining involves performing the same motions over and over again, which can fatigue the body and make it susceptible to injury. Overtraining can also cause your fitness to plateau. So no matter your favorite activity, you should routinely mix things up.

“Try new machines at the gym,” Herrington said. “Take a group exercise class. Incorporate strength training exercises into cardiovascular routines.”

Developing a strong core is essential, too. “Core exercises strengthen the front and back of your body, improve your posture and help you move better,” she said.

Build your routine gradually

No matter what workout regimen you settle on, the key to staying healthy is to start slow and low. Increase the time or intensity of your workouts by just 10% per week, McDonald said, and never boost both the intensity and duration simultaneously.

Then, enjoy.

“The goal of regular exercise is to be able to move with comfort and ease for as long as we possibly can,” Herrington said. “Doing the right exercises for your body and mind, mixing up your routine every now and then, enlisting a professional when you need guidance, and choosing exercises that bring you joy are all important pieces to living a healthy life.”

316,"Teen tyrannosaur had a taste for baby dinos, rare fossil reveals","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Researchers have found a tyrannosaur’s last meal perfectly preserved inside its stomach cavity.

What was on the menu 75 million years ago? The hind legs of two baby dinosaurs, according to new research on the fossil published Friday in the journal Science Advances.

Dinosaur guts and hard evidence of their diets are rarely preserved in the fossil record, and it is the first time the stomach contents of a tyrannosaur have been uncovered.

The revelation makes this discovery particularly exciting, said co-lead author Darla Zelenitsky, a paleontologist and associate professor at the University of Calgary in Alberta.

“Tyrannosaurs are these large predatory species that roamed Alberta, and North America, during the late Cretaceous. These were the iconic apex or top predators that we’ve all seen in movies, books and museums. They walked on two legs (and) had very short arms,” Zelenitsky said.

“It was a cousin of T. rex, which came later in time, 68 to 66 million years ago. T. rex is the biggest of the tyrannosaurs, Gorgosaurus was a little bit smaller, maybe full grown would have been 9, 10 meters (33 feet).”

The tyrannosaur in question, a young Gorgosaurus libratus, would have weighed about 772 pounds (350 kilograms) — less than a horse — and reached 13 feet (4 meters) in length at the time of death.

The creature was between the ages of 5 and 7 and appeared to be picky in what it consumed, Zelenitsky said.

“Its last and second-to-last meal were these little birdlike dinosaurs, Citipes, and the tyrannosaur actually only ate the hind limbs of each of these prey items. There’s really no other skeletal remains of these predators within the stomach cavity. It’s just the hind legs.

“It must have killed … both of these Citipes at different times and then ripped off the hind legs and ate those and left the rest of the carcasses,” she added. “Obviously this teenager had an appetite for drumsticks.”

The two baby dinosaurs both belonged to the species called Citipes elegans and would have been younger than 1 year old when the tyrannosaur hunted them down, the researchers determined.

The almost complete skeleton was found in Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park in 2009.

That the tyrannosaur’s stomach contents were preserved wasn’t immediately obvious, but staff at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta, noticed small protruding bones when preparing the fossil in the lab and removed a rock within its rib cage to take a closer look.

“Lo and behold, the complete hind legs of two baby dinosaurs, both under a year old, were present in its stomach,” said co-lead author François Therrien, the museum’s curator of dinosaur paleoecology, in a statement.

The paleontologists were able to determine the ages of both the predator and its prey by analyzing thin slices sampled from the fossilized bones.

“There’s growth marks like the rings of a tree. And we can essentially tell how old a dinosaur is from looking at those, the structure of the bone,” Zelenitsky said.

Changing appetites of top predators

The fossil is the first hard evidence of a long-suspected dietary pattern among large predatory dinosaurs, said paleoecologist Kat Schroeder, a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University’s department of Earth and planetary science, who wasn’t involved in the research.

The teen tyrannosaur didn’t eat what its parents did. Paleontologists believe its diet would have changed over its life span.

“Large, robust tyrannosaurs like T. rex have bite forces strong enough to hit bone when eating, and so we know they bit into megaherbivores like Triceratops,” Schroeder said via email. “Juvenile tyrannosaurs can’t bite as deep, and therefore don’t leave such feeding traces.”

She said that scientists have previously hypothesized that young tyrannosaurs had different diets from fully developed adults, but the fossil find marks the first time researchers have direct evidence.

“Combined with the relative rarity of juvenile tyrannosaur skeletons, this fossil is very significant,” Schroeder added. “Teeth can only tell us so much about the diet of extinct animals, so finding stomach contents is like picking up the proverbial ‘smoking gun.’”

The contents of the tyrannosaur’s stomach cavity revealed that at this stage in life, juveniles were hunting swift, small prey. It was likely because the predator’s body wasn’t yet well-suited for bigger prey, Zelenitsky said.

“It’s well known that tyrannosaurs changed a lot during growth, from slender forms to these robust, bone-crushing dinosaurs, and we know that this change was related to feeding behavior.”

When the dinosaur died, its mass was only 10% of that of an adult Gorgosaurus, she said.

How juvenile tyrannosaurs filled a niche

The voracious appetite of teenage tyrannosaurs and other carnivores has been thought to explain a puzzling feature of dinosaur diversity.

There are relatively few small and midsize dinosaurs in the fossil record, particularly in the Mid- to Late Cretaceous Period — something paleontologists have determined is due to the hunting activities of young tyrannosaurs.

“In Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park, where this specimen is from, we have a very well sampled formation. And so we have a pretty good idea of the ecosystem there. Over 50 species of dinosaurs,” Zelenitsky said.

“We are missing mid-sized … predators from that ecosystem. So yeah, there’s been the hypothesis that, the juvenile tyrannosaurs filled that niche.”","['tyrannosaur', 'taste', 'dinosaurs', 'teen', 'rare', 'dinos', 'tyrrell', 'museum', 'stomach', 'zelenitsky', 'tyrannosaurs', 'baby', 'gorgosaurus', 'fossil', 'dinosaur', 'reveals']","The hind legs of two baby dinosaurs, according to new research on the fossil published Friday in the journal Science Advances.

318,Tesla failed at battery swapping but Stellantis says it may have the secret,"CNN —

It can take 20 minutes to “fast charge” an electric car up to 80%. But what if you could just change the batteries like they were AAs in a toy, and be back on the road fully charged in a handful of minutes?

It seems like an obvious solution, but there have been some famous failures with battery swapping. A decade ago, Tesla announced it would build out a network of battery swapping stations that could change out Model S’s battery pack in 90 seconds. But like many of CEO Elon Musk’s publicly-announced ideas, it was later dropped with Musk claiming customers weren’t interested.

And in 2013, an Israeli company that promised battery swapping called Better Place went out of business after burning through $850 million in cash and deploying only about 1,000 cars, according to reports at the time.

But the idea has become a reality, again, at least in Asia. Chinese EV maker Nio has been offering battery swapping for its vehicles since 2019. Nio now claims to be the world’s largest operator of battery swapping technology having performed over 32 million battery swaps since then at more than 2,100 stations.

Now Stellantis, the global automaker that makes Jeep, Dodge and Fiat vehicles, is also trying out the idea on a small scale – with a crucial difference – in hopes of incorporating it in future EV models.

Stellantis is working with a company called Ample that has created a new battery swapping system it says can work in virtually any shape or size of vehicle. It says the system doesn’t require any automaker to alter its vehicle to fit a special battery pack.

With Ample’s system, the entire battery pack – which can weigh more than 1,000 pounds – doesn’t get replaced as a single unit. Instead, a number of individually sealed battery modules about the size of a desktop computer are taken out by automated machinery and replaced one by one. In this way, all the vehicle’s batteries can be quickly replaced in easily manageable chunks rather than in a single huge slab.

That means it might take five to, at most, 10 minutes to change batteries, depending on the size of the vehicle and how many modules there are, instead of the 90 seconds Musk had promised. But having separate small battery packs provides numerous advantages.

First, the equipment required to change the batteries can be small. Ample’s battery swap stations, which handle the work automatically, look like backyard sheds with an extra-thick wall. The wall is where the battery modules are stored and charged. There’s no need to dig a hole in the ground underneath the battery swapping station, either, as might be the case if the equipment needed to handle entire big, heavy battery packs.

Because the batteries don’t need high-powered DC fast charging – they have plenty of time to charge inside the hut wall – the battery swapping stations don’t require the kind of high-wattage power connections fast-charging stations do. That simplifies their installation, said Khaled Hassounah, founder and chief executive of Ample.

Also, the vehicle itself can be of any shape or size. An SUV, car or truck doesn’t need to be designed around an Ample battery pack. The battery modules fit into a container on the underside of the vehicle where a battery pack would usually go. The container is adapted to the size and shape of the vehicle. A large vehicle could simply hold more battery modules while a smaller vehicle would hold fewer of them.

Besides Stellantis, Ample is also working with heavy equipment maker Mitsubishi Fuso on a battery-swapping test with commercial trucks in Japan. In the United States, the system is being tested with a variety of different Uber vehicles around the San Francisco Bay area. Ample’s 12 battery-swapping stations in the Bay area are used “a few hundred” times a day, according to the company.

The Ample battery modules can still be charged in the vehicle at a regular EV charger, so drivers would have the option of either plugging in or swapping batteries depending on the situation. As usual, most EV owners could still plug their cars in overnight at home.

Stellantis has not said it will necessarily incorporate the system into its EV models for sale around the world. Next year, Stellantis will use the Ample battery swap system in a fleet of 100 Fiat 500e electric cars in Spain that are part of the company’s Free2Move car-sharing service.

The Fiat 500e, a tiny electric car with a range of about 150 miles, provides a perfect test case for battery swapping, said Ricardo Stamatti-Avila, Stellantis’s vice president for charging and energy.

“If you want to extend the range of a car, the answer right now is you just throw more batteries at it,” he said. “But when you have limited real estate, like in a Fiat 500, that means we’d need to make the car bigger, and then it’s not a Fiat 500 anymore, right?”

Even with larger vehicles, Ample’s battery swapping system could free drivers from having to buy lots of extra battery power they might only rarely use, as they do now. Customers could just rent the extra battery packs they need for the occasional long trip, said Stamatti-Avila.

If the system works well in Spain, he said, Stellantis will look first to commercial fleet customers to start building up an infrastructure of swapping stations. Ordinary retail customers could start using the system once there are a good number of swapping stations available.

On the other hand, if Stellantis’s Spanish experiment doesn’t pan out, this whole battery-swapping thing might just never be talked about again, as happened with Tesla.","['batteries', 'system', 'failed', 'vehicle', 'stellantis', 'battery', 'modules', 'ample', 'size', 'stations', 'swapping', 'vehicles', 'secret', 'tesla']","It seems like an obvious solution, but there have been some famous failures with battery swapping.

319,"Could the most magical time of year be so full of loneliness, anger and stress?","Editor’s note: Dr. Neha Chaudhary is a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and chief medical officer at Modern Health.

CNN —

As the holiday season approaches, many conjure up images of the perfect gathering: comforting aromas of home-cooked feasts, harmonious laughter between friends and family, and thoughts of gratitude that easily roll off the tongue.

But for some people, this time of year feels like the exact opposite. It’s a time of stress, emotional turmoil or intense loneliness that looks nothing like the traditional celebration of togetherness.

Sixty-six percent of people report feeling lonely at the holidays, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, while 64% of people with mental illness say that the holidays make their condition worse. And as a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist, I see these issues firsthand all too often.

Why are loneliness and emotional distress so common this time of year? Some people may be living far from family or may not be able to afford to travel to see them. Others may be grieving the loss of loved ones or navigating strained relationships — and the holidays can serve as a rude reminder of those losses. And for some, the holiday season brings families together who would rather be apart. Whatever the cause, the impact of the holidays on our mental health can be profound.

If this sounds like you, you’re clearly not alone. And if your experience at this time of year is the exact opposite, remember that your friends, colleagues or strangers may be having a hard time at the holidays.

Understanding and navigating loneliness

While the holiday season is portrayed as a time for family and social gatherings, that expectation can inadvertently amplify feelings of isolation. That’s true not only for those who find themselves alone, but also for those who are surrounded by loved ones.

The problem is loneliness is killing us — literally. According to the US surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, loneliness is as bad for your health as is smoking every day. It can increase your risk of mental health conditions, stroke, heart disease and even premature death.

Fortunately, there are ways to tackle the feeling. If you’ve been feeling lonely this holiday season, the first thing you can do is recognize and name it. Let the feeling roll in as if it’s a fleeting moment that will pass. If you try to resist a feeling, usually it will push back, staying longer than its welcome. If you allow the feeling to float on through you, it can float away just as easily as it came.

Next, see if you can pinpoint the source of the feeling. Do the holidays remind you of the loss of a loved one, or are they connected to a negative experience from your childhood? Or is it that you find yourself comparing yourself with others, only to feel like you aren’t measuring up to your own expectations, set by social comparison?

Once you identify the trigger for the emotion, you can try to talk to yourself about it with compassion as if you would talk to a friend. Remind yourself that it’s OK to grieve. Tell yourself that comparison is a distraction and put aside your social media. Or remind yourself that you can make investments in relationships if you really want to — you do have some control.

Lastly, find ways for connection with others in the moment. Is there a friend you haven’t texted in a while? A group activity you could join that leaves you with a sense of community? If you don’t have existing connections to turn to, having a brief interaction with a stranger can work as well. Chat with someone outside of your home or better yet offer to help or give something to a stranger. The sense of connection it can foster may surprise you. And it’s good for your health.

Gratitude, reflection and … anger?

While the focus of this time of year tends to be around reflection and gratitude, for some people it brings on a completely different feeling: anger. Anger toward family members who, when brought together, bring unresolved tensions up to the surface as a group. Anger toward loved ones who bailed on them many years ago. Or anger about life not going according to plan.

Sound like you? If so, put aside your self-judgment and let yourself feel. And then do something about it. What are ways you can share your anger that are respectful and constructive? Is there a conversation you can have with a loved one to work through hurt feelings from the past? If that doesn’t feel doable, consider writing your feelings down in a letter that you may never give the other person. Sometimes the act of getting it out of your brain and down on paper can feel like a welcome release. You can tear up the letter and throw it in the trash or flush it down the toilet, picturing the anger leaving you as you destroy the letter itself.

Handling the stress and pressure

Navigating the expectations and pressures set by society (and yourself) around the holidays can be similar to walking a tightrope. Whether it’s the expertly roasted turkey or picture-perfect family gatherings, idealized holiday movie and social media images can create a sense of pressure that might overshadow the essence of gratitude and togetherness. Ultimately, these unrealistic standards often lead to unnecessary stress and a sense of inadequacy for many people.

To break yourself out of the trap of comparison and never-ending expectations, start by acknowledging that perfection is an elusive goal and not the point of the holidays. Embrace imperfections. Try out new rituals and routines that are relaxed, goofy and inconsistent year to year, just for the sake of having fun.

Set boundaries with family and friends who have high expectations of you, whether it’s your aunt’s commentary on what you should wear to dinner, your mother’s criticism of your cooking, or your father-in-law’s comments about how you should be spending more time with that side of the family than you are. Practice in advance what you’re going to say to people when they push your boundaries.

The holiday blues

This holiday season is going to be hard for a lot of people, for a lot of different reasons. If uncomfortable feelings arise for you this holiday, I encourage you to hold space for them.

If you’re feeling low, give yourself a pass and turn your focus to ways you can take care of yourself and your mental health, whether it’s curling up under a blanket and binge-watching movies, writing in a journal, listening to music, expressing yourself through art or calling an old friend. Recognize what you need to survive this moment. And if nothing else is working, turn to a professional for help.

For many people, it will be the most wonderful time of the year. For others, it won’t. The more we encourage a culture of empathy and understanding around all the emotions that come with the holidays, the more we can strengthen our communities and lift each other up when it matters. And this might be one of the times of year that it matters most.

320,"In Miami Beach, a new street art installation celebrates the city’s vibrant drag scene","CNN —

The newest work of public art in Miami Beach, Florida, is an ode to drag. On Tuesday, city officials unveiled “Adora Vanessa Athena Fantasia,” a vibrant series of aluminum panels suspended over a block of the bustling Española Way shopping district. Each panel features a kaleidoscopic portrait inspired by local drag queens (including the four who inspired its title: Adora, Athena Dion, Fantasia Royale and Tiffany Fantasia), and is accompanied by a 30-foot-tall mural of dramatic manicures, doll-like eyelashes and full, pouty lips.

These quintessential elements in the art of drag come together as “a costume, a work outfit and a kind of armor in one,” said Persephone Von Lips, one of eleven queens who inspired the installation. “The hair, the makeup, the nails, the whole getup — when I put them on, I can walk down any street and feel the most beautiful and most confident I’ve ever been.”

“Adora Vanessa Athena Fantasia” is a work by Assume Vivid Astro Focus, or AVAF, an artist collective known for its multidisciplinary installations and psychedelic explosions of color. The City of Miami Beach commissioned the piece as the latest installment of Elevate Española, a semi-annual public art project launched in 2021.

Eli Sudbrack, the Brazilian artist who founded AVAF in New York some 20 years ago, wanted to pay tribute to Miami Beach’s bustling drag scene. He was motivated in large part by a law that Florida governor and Republican presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis signed in April, which sought to limit drag performances in the state.

Named the “Protection of Children Act” by its sponsors, the law threatened venues that admitted children into “adult live performances” — a phrase widely understood to mean drag — with fines, misdemeanor charges or revoked liquor licenses. In June, a district judge temporarily blocked the law on grounds that it would “suppress the speech of drag queen performers,” and the US Supreme Court declined the state’s request for a partial stay in November. Still, attorneys for the DeSantis administration are seeking to overturn the law’s temporary block in federal appeals court.

""Energizing the viewer always seems to be the intention of drag performances and that is also an important feature in our work,"" explained AVAF's Eli Sudbrack in a statement. City of Miami Beach Communications Department

Across the US, where at least a dozen other states have attempted to pass similar laws, drag remains a central topic in a larger culture war targeting LGBTQ rights.

“There’s still a fear in the back of our heads: What are they going to do next?” said Von Lips. Historically, the drag community has given refuge to trans and queer people rejected by society or their families, she added, “and I just think it’s insane that people are trying to take that away from us.”

The spectacle of drag

After AVAF was chosen for the Elevate Española commission earlier this year, the New York-based Sudbrack began his research online, reaching out to Tiffany Fantasia, a veteran on the Miami drag scene, to learn more about the local community. The artist also asked a friend in Miami to send him a list of iconic performers from both the South Beach and Downtown Miami scenes, which ultimately included the aforementioned queens, as well as Karla Croqueta, Juice Love Dion, Lady Paraiso, Power Infiniti, Regina Black and TP Lords.

Looking to the queens’ Instagrams for reference, Sudbrack said, “I started making drawings out of details of their personas: (the) makeup, lipstick, wigs and nails, so that the central panels are a mixture of different drag queens put together as a super powerful image.” The composite portraits of each panel represent the overall community rather than individuals, energized by the psychedelic hues and patterns for which AVAF is known.

Sudbrack’s mural, meanwhile, used the colors of the Progress Pride flag as its palette. The piece zooms in on features of individual queens — the faces of Athena Dion and TP Lords; the manicured hands of Regina Black, for example — rendering them in a cartoonish style of graphic outlines.

“It was very important, if I’m going to do a project in Miami right now, to honor this practice, no matter what,” Sudbrack said. “Our own practice has always been about self-expression and freedom, and the artistry of drag is about that — to be whoever you want to be.”

Lissette Garcia Arrogante, director of tourism and culture for the City of Miami Beach, said AVAF was an ideal choice for the commission, citing “all the vibrancy and vitality of the colors in their work.”

“Miami Beach proudly stands as one of the world’s most welcoming LGBTQ destinations, where the drag scene thrives despite Florida’s misguided efforts,” added Miami Beach Commissioner Alex Fernandez, reflecting on the work’s content. “We emphatically ‘elevate’ and celebrate diversity, resisting any attempts to dim our community’s spirit.”

Despite the governor’s efforts, Tiffany Fantasia said she’s confident in her right to remain in drag. “Anything is possible with these extreme Republicans, but we all know at the end of the day, it is not constitutional for them to do this type of stuff,” she said. “It’s a violation of freedom of expression”

322,These ‘dome homes’ made from soil mix tradition and innovation,"CNN —

In Morocco, a startup is building affordable homes using a material that is ubiquitous: soil.

Eco-dôme Maroc was founded in 2016. It applies local traditions to modern technology to construct dome-shaped buildings that it says are cheaper, more environmentally sustainable and more energy-efficient than regular concrete homes.

Founder Youness Ouazri says he discovered “a very rich tradition of earthen construction” used by previous generations while he was traveling around the country.

“We simply took this existing know-how and adjusted it to modern technologies to come up with a concept that is eco-friendly, cost effective and very rapid to implement,” he tells CNN.

Each home Eco-dôme builds is unique. Once the company receives an order, the first step is to analyze the soil composition on site to determine its suitability for construction.

Small quantities of lime or cement can be added for optimal performance, and thermal simulation models are run to ascertain the ideal thickness of the dome’s walls, so that it can absorb heat during the summer and release it during the winter. That means the building will use as little energy as possible for heating and cooling — sometimes none at all, says Ouazri, who trained as a civil engineer.

He adds that the eco-domes are much faster to build than a standard home. Prices range from around 2,500 Moroccan dirhams ($247) per square meter to 4,500 dirhams ($445), and can vary according to the soil and site. Ouazri says that can be a third cheaper than a standard home “mainly because we eliminate a big part of the raw materials that we’d need to acquire, since we are using local soil. We also eliminate the logistics associated with that, such as transporting materials to the site.”

Eco-dôme builds the homes using different techniques. One is called “superadobe,” which was devised in the 1980s by Iranian American architect Nader Khalili, and uses stacked polypropylene bags filled with soil. Other methods include using a wooden frame for the structures to obtain a rectangular, rather than round, floorplan.

The first Eco-dôme was completed in 2017. “It was a 775-square-feet house in a rural area near Rabat, the Moroccan capital, built for a client that uses it as a holiday house,” Ouazri says.

Since then, the company has built more than 100 domes across 40 different sites. The largest is a 2,700-square-foot cultural center in Agouim, 70 miles south-east of Marrakech, in an area with a harsh climate that swings from below freezing in winter to scorching hot in the summer.

‘Frugal innovation’

The company, which has received around $300,000 in investment to date and employs 17 people, has three main types of client, Ouazri says: “Land owners who want to build a primary or secondary home in the most ecological way possible; investors in rural tourism and eco-tourism; and local authorities and communities, to build schools or other infrastructure for education and healthcare.”

Eco-dôme now aims to start building in other countries and is looking at Tunisia and the Ivory Coast first.

Youssef El Ganadi, a professor of architecture at the International University of Rabat, who is not affiliated with Eco-dôme, says the project is an interesting “frugal innovation,” meant to make affordable homes for all social categories, and adds that it is sustainable.

However, he believes the uptake of the homes has been limited by a cultural barrier.

“Here in Morocco and in North Africa in general, many people have a mentality of wanting homes made of concrete, which they believe are more modern and robust,” he says. “That has limited the project to a niche, favored mainly by those with a certain sensibility to environmental causes and particularly for second homes.”

Ganadi also questions the earthquake resistance of superadobe domes. In September, Morocco was hit with a devastating quake that killed almost 3,000 people.

Ouzrai says attitudes are slowly changing. He adds that the Eco-dômes are built in compliance with local construction regulations, saying “buildings using superadobe or other earthen techniques are resilient to earthquakes” and that “four of our buildings were nearby the epicenter of the earthquake and stood still in front of it.”

“[Earth] lasts longer than industrialized materials,” Ouzrai says. “In certain regions in Morocco, we have buildings that were made thousands of years ago. With the appropriate maintenance, our domes can last forever.”

323,Pompeii archaeologists uncover bakery that doubled as prison,"Rome CNN —

An ancient bakery operated by slaves has been discovered in the ruins of Pompeii, the Pompeii Archaeological Park said in a statement released Friday.

Enslaved people and donkeys were locked up together and used to power a mill to grind grain for bread, according to details of the discovery provided by the park.

The site consists of a narrow room with no external view but only small, high windows covered by bars through which minimal light passed. There were also indentations in the floor “to coordinate the movement of the animals, forced to walk around for hours, blindfolded,” the statement said.

The discovery was made in the Regio IX section of the popular tourist site, which is also an ongoing archaeological dig. The area is currently being excavated as part of a larger project designed to secure and maintain previously excavated areas of the Roman city.

The discovery was made during the excavation of a home in Pompeii. Parco Archeologico Di Pompei/Reuters

Archaeologists discovered the bakery while excavating an ancient Pompeiian home that was being renovated when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 C.E., covering the city of Pompeii with ash.

The bodies of three victims of the eruption were found in recent months, believed to be residents of the home rather than slaves. The house was divided into a residential section with “refined frescoes” on one side, and a commercial bakery on the other.

Next to the bakery was the dimly lit prison area, Pompeii Archaeological Park director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said in an interview posted on the site’s YouTube channel.

“What has emerged is testimony of the backbreaking work to which men, women, and animals were subjected in the ancient mill-bakeries,” he added.

Zuchtriegel said these prison bakeries were previously described by the Roman writer Apuleius in the 2nd century C.E., in his novel “Metamorphoses” (also known as “The Golden Ass”), in which the protagonist, Lucius, “transformed into a donkey and was sold to a miller.” Zuchtriegel said the episode was based on the writer’s direct knowledge of the animals and humans living and working together.

The prison area had no doors to the outside world. Parco Archeologico Di Pompei/Reuters

The newly discovered prison area had no doors to the outside, only to the inner atrium.

“It is, in other words, a space in which we must imagine the presence of people of servile status whose owner felt the need to limit the freedom of movement,” Zuchtriegel said.

“It is the most shocking side of ancient slavery, the side devoid of relationships of trust, where it was reduced to brute violence, an impression which is fully confirmed by the closing of the few windows with iron grates.”

Archaeologists also believe that the indentations in the slab flooring were not made by repetitive movement but were carved to prevent the donkeys and other animals from slipping on the pavement and to force them to only walk in a circular motion to grind the grain, almost like a clockwork mechanism.

“The iconographic and literary sources, in particular the reliefs from the tomb of Eurysaces in Rome, suggest that a millstone was normally moved by a couple made up of a donkey and a slave,” Zuchtriegel said.

“The latter, in addition to pushing the grindstone, had the task of encouraging the animal and monitoring the grinding process, adding grain and removing flour.”

The site will complement an exhibition that opens December 15, called “The Other Pompeii: common lives in the shadow of Vesuvius,” which is dedicated to what Zuchtriegel calls the “myriad of individuals often forgotten by historical chronicles, such as the slaves, who constituted the majority of the population and whose work contributed significantly to the economy, but also to the culture and social fabric of Roman civilization.”","['site', 'animals', 'area', 'prison', 'ancient', 'slaves', 'roman', 'archaeologists', 'uncover', 'zuchtriegel', 'pompeii', 'bakery', 'doubled']","Rome CNN —An ancient bakery operated by slaves has been discovered in the ruins of Pompeii, the Pompeii Archaeological Park said in a statement released Friday.

CNN —

In a court in Harris County, Texas, something remarkable happened this week: A woman and her husband asked a judge for an emergency order granting her permission to end a pregnancy.

Mary Zeigler Bill Lax/Bill Lax/FSU Photography Service

Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, had learned that the child she was carrying had full trisomy 18, a rare genetic condition that is almost always fatal. Her physicians have warned that continuing the pregnancy could put her at risk for life-threatening complications. Cox, who wants to have a third child, might also lose her ability to do so if forced to carry the pregnancy to term.

The judge granted Cox’s request on Thursday, but the state will almost certainly appeal to what is a Texas Supreme Court with nine Republican members. Late Friday, the Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocked the lower court’s ruling. But regardless of what happens next, Cox’s suit will shape the abortion debate going forward — not least because it is historic.

Cox is part of a new generation of plaintiffs telling heartbreaking stories about their experiences under criminal laws in places such as Texas, Idaho, Tennessee and Oklahoma — plaintiffs willing to speak out in a climate where support for abortion is at a record high, according to a WSJ-NORC poll, and some of the stigma surrounding abortion seems less intense. But given the popularity of abortion rights — and the obvious tragedy faced by women like Cox — why are states like Texas fighting so hard to defend their narrow exceptions?

The answer is that Cox’s case and others like it expose how unworkable abortion exceptions are under current law in states with virtual bans, especially when they are attached to harsh penalties like life in prison. Conceding that a woman like Cox is right could threaten to send much else about criminal abortion laws toppling down.

It is worth remarking on how rare Cox’s suit is. Before Roe v. Wade, patients and doctors both questioned the constitutionality of abortion laws. In some cases, pregnant patients were named plaintiffs: This was the case for Norma McCorvey, the “Roe” in Roe v. Wade, and Sandra Cano, the plaintiff in Roe’s companion case, Doe v. Bolton. These suits adjudicated whether a law was permissible, but often did not change what happened to a particular pregnant plaintiff (McCorvey, for example, famously carried what some called the “Roe baby” to term). After Roe, minors acting without parental consent or notification sought court-ordered abortion under what were called “judicial bypass” laws, often also while maintaining anonymity.

Cox’s case is quite different. She is an adult, not a minor, and she has not concealed her identity. Her willingness to tell her story is no doubt due to her own strength and commitment, but our present political moment likely has something to do with it too. Poll after poll find strong, if not unprecedented, support for legal abortion, even in states where abortion bans are already in effect. Backlash to these bans — and to the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization — has made it easier for other women to describe their own experiences with criminal laws and to file suits of their own.

McCorvey and Cano used pseudonyms at a time when pursuing abortion rights might have come at great personal and political cost. Women like Cox and Amanda Zurawski, who is challenging the validity of Texas’s medical emergency exception to abortion, use their own names, and do so with the knowledge that most Americans support legal abortion — and all the more so in cases like theirs.

When states fight plaintiffs like Cox and Zurawski in court, it hardly helps Republicans already on the defensive about abortion. It is comparably easy to paint bans as heartless and extreme when the state shows no sympathy for women who stand to lose their fertility, health or lives.

Suits like Cox’s expose how hard it would be to devise a workable abortion exception. In theory, a functioning exception would advance the state’s interest in fetal life while offering a real opportunity for people in exceptional cases that the state deems deserving. But if a state requires harsh punishment — Texas, for example, authorizes life in prison for abortion — few doctors will be willing to gamble that they are interpreting the law correctly, even if an exception is relatively clear.

Most exceptions, it turns out, aren’t clear anyway, written not by physicians but by lawmakers who use the language of criminal law, and sometimes write more than one exception into various criminal abortion laws, as in Oklahoma. The broader and more compassionate a state makes an exception, the higher the odds that more plaintiffs like Cox will prevail, but that will require deference to patients and physicians that anti-abortion states focused on punishing abortion providers reject as a matter of principle.

Exceptions almost always leave out other tragic circumstances. Texas has a medical emergency exception, but dismisses a fatal fetal abnormality that could deprive Cox of the ability to have a third child as nothing different than what is experienced by “countless women who give birth every day.” The risk of death, the state says, is simply “not imminent” enough. Andy Beshear, the Democratic governor of Kentucky, just made anger about a similar provision in his state’s law a central message of his successful reelection campaign.

Republican lawmakers often seem to want it both ways on abortion. They define themselves as pro-life but insist on compassion for women, especially in the so-called hard cases like Cox’s.

But what is happening in Texas complicates that narrative. Texas purports to value fetal life and women’s health — but then denies that the unborn have rights when that strategy will help defeat a lawsuit brought by a prison employee forced to stay at her post who lost her pregnancy. Texas claims compassion for women but requires that their lives or a major bodily function be at imminent risk before a doctor can step in. And Texas claims to protect life by forcing a woman like Cox to carry a child who almost certainly won’t live while threatening her ability to have a child who will.

All of this is a reminder of the priorities of state abortion laws, which are not about the value of life in the womb, but about criminal punishment — and about crafting exceptions that will rarely, if ever, be used. Cox’s suit matters because it is historic, but also because of what it tells us. When the chips are down, given a choice between protecting women like Cox and criminalizing those who offer abortions, we know what states like Texas will choose every time.","['exposing', 'exception', 'laws', 'truth', 'texas', 'states', 'women', 'opinion', 'life', 'law', 'chilling', 'woman', 'abortion', 'cox', 'state', 'roe']","Conceding that a woman like Cox is right could threaten to send much else about criminal abortion laws toppling down.

326,‘Turtwig’ ancient turtle species discovered after fossil mystery solved,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Ancient plant fossils that puzzled scientists have turned out not to be plants after all, new research has revealed.

Instead, the small round shapes bearing a leaflike pattern were once the shells of baby turtles that lived during the time of dinosaurs. Scientists have nicknamed the turtle species “Turtwig,” after a Pokémon character that is half-turtle, half-plant.

The discovery marks the first time baby turtle carapaces have been found in northwestern South America, according to the study authors.

The results of their research were published Thursday in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.

“In the Pokémon universe, you encounter the concept of combining two or more elements, such as animals, machines, plants, etc.,” said lead author Héctor Palma-Castro, a graduate student of paleobotany at the National University of Colombia, in a statement.

“So, when you have a fossil initially classified as a plant that turns out to be a baby turtle, a few Pokémon immediately come to mind. In this case, Turtwig, a baby turtle with a leaf attached to its head.”

But it took some sleuthing to solve this paleontological mystery that began decades ago.

Wrong place, wrong time

It all started when Colombian priest Padre Gustavo Huertas discovered the fossils in the Paja Formation. The formation is part of one of Colombia’s geological heritage sites called the Marine Reptile Lagerstätte of the Ricaurte Alto.

Previous fossil discoveries from the site include dinosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, ichthyosaurs, turtles and crocodile relatives called crocodylopmorphs dated from the Early Cretaceous Period, between 113 million and 132 million years ago.

Huertas collected fossils and rocks at the site, near the town of Villa de Leyva, from the 1950s to the 1970s. When he found the leaf-patterned rocks, he deemed them a fossil plant. Huertas went on to describe the specimens as Sphenophyllum colombianum in a 2003 study.

But other scientists were surprised to hear that the plant was discovered in northern South America and dated between 113 million and 132 million years ago. The now-extinct plant, once prevalent around the world, died out more than 100 million years earlier, according to the fossil record.

Previous research about the plant showed that its leaves were typically wedge-shaped with veins that radiated out from the base of the leaf.

The age and location of the fossils intrigued Palma-Castro and Fabiany Herrera, the assistant curator of paleobotany at the Negaunee Integrative Research Center at Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History.

Herrera collects and studies plants from the Early Cretaceous Period (100.5 million to 145 million years ago) in northwestern South America, a part of the continent where little paleobotanical research takes place.

Both fossils, about 2 inches (5 centimeters) in diameter, were housed in collections at the National University of Colombia’s department of geosciences. As Herrera and Palma-Castro examined and photographed the fossils, they thought something seemed strange.

“When you look at it in detail, the lines seen on the fossils don’t look like the veins of a plant — I was positive that it was most likely bone,” said Herrera, the study’s senior author, in a statement.

Solving a fossil mystery

Herrera contacted his colleague Edwin-Alberto Cadena, a senior lecturer and paleontologist who studies turtles and other vertebrates at Del Rosario University in Bogotá, Colombia.

“They sent me the photos, and I said, ‘This definitely looks like a carapace’ — the bony upper shell of a turtle,” said Cadena, a study coauthor, in a statement. “I said, ‘Well, this is remarkable, because this is not only a turtle, but it’s also a hatchling specimen, it’s very, very small.’”

Cadena and one of his students, Diego Cómbita-Romero at the National University of Colombia, compared the fossils with the shells of other extinct and modern turtles.

“When we saw the specimen for the first time I was astonished, because the fossil was missing the typical marks on the outside of a turtle’s shell,” said study coauthor Cómbita-Romero in a statement. “It was a little bit concave, like a bowl. At that moment we realized that the visible part of the fossil was the other side of the carapace, we were looking at the part of the shell that is inside the turtle.”

During their analysis of the shells, the researchers determined that the turtles were about 1 year old at the most when they died.

As young turtles develop, their growth rates and sizes can vary, Cómbita-Romero said. But it’s rare to find remains of young turtles because the bones in their shells are so thin.

“These turtles were likely relatives of other Cretaceous species that were up to fifteen feet long, but we don’t know much about how they actually grew to such giant sizes,” Cadena said in a statement.

The researchers didn’t blame Huertas for mistakenly categorizing the fossils as plants. What he believed to be leaves and stems were the vertebrae and rib bones within a turtle’s shell.

“We resolved a small paleobotanical mystery, but more importantly, this study shows the need to re-study historical collections in Colombia. The Early Cretaceous is a critical time in land plant evolution,” Herrera said.

The research team next aims to uncover the forests that once grew in the region, he said.

“In paleontology, your imagination and capacity to be amazed are always put to the test,” Palma-Castro said. “Discoveries like these are truly special because they not only expand our knowledge about the past but also open a window to the diverse possibilities of what we can uncover.”","['turtles', 'plant', 'million', 'shells', 'species', 'university', 'solved', 'fossils', 'turtwig', 'ancient', 'fossil', 'discovered', 'mystery', 'study', 'turtle', 'research']","CNN —Ancient plant fossils that puzzled scientists have turned out not to be plants after all, new research has revealed.

327,Woman who threw bowl of food at Chipotle worker sentenced to work 2 months in fast food job,"New York CNN —

A woman who threw a bowl of hot food in the face of a Chipotle worker has been sentenced to a month in jail — and two months working a fast food job.

Videos of the woman, Rosemary Hayne, berating Chipotle worker Emily Russell on September 5 and then throwing the food in her face at close range, went viral after the incident. Hayne, a 39-year old mother of four, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge and received the sentence last week in the Parma, Ohio, municipal court. Judge Timothy Gilligan gave her the choice of a 90-day jail sentence or a 30-day sentence on top of 60 days working in a fast food job.

“Do you want to walk in her shoes for two months and learn how people should treat people, or do you want to do your jail time?” Gilligan asked Hayne at the hearing.

“I’d like to walk in her shoes,” Hayne responded.

Hayne has yet to find the job, Gilligan and her attorney told CNN on Wednesday. Her attorney, Joseph O’Malley, said his client had no criminal record before the incident and that she is truly sorry for her actions that day.

“Let’s give her the opportunity to not let this one day define the rest of her life,” he told CNN.

Gilligan said Hayne will have to have her job approved by the court, and will have to work there 20 hours a week. O’Malley said Hayne does not currently have a job.

Gilligan told CNN he thought about the possible unusual sentence a couple of days before the November hearing.

“Every time you watch the video, it makes you more and more upset,” he said. “I was thinking, ‘What else can I do rather than just have her sit in jail.’”

Asked if he would want to hire Hayne if he ran a fast food restaurant, the judge said he doesn’t think she’ll have trouble finding a job.

“I don’t see her as any greater risk than anyone who walks in off the street,” he said. “I looked at it as someone who lost her cool.”

Gilligan said it’s the first time he’s handed down this kind of sentence, but unfortunately it’s the not the first incident of this kind to come before him. He said there was one case a couple of years ago in which a customer who didn’t get a cookie in a Happy Meal at a McDonald’s reached through the drive-thru window and started punching a worker. That defendant got 90 days in jail, he said.

“I see these cases more than I want to,” said Gilligan, who has been a judge for 30 years.

Asked for a comment on the case, Chipotle responded: “The health and safety of our employees is our greatest priority, and we’re pleased to see justice served for any individual that does not treat our team members with the respect they deserve.”

Hayne declined a request for an interview made through O’Malley. Russell told the court that she is still dealing with stress from the incident, and that she quit the job at Chipotle after the attack and found another job. She said she would like to begin counseling to deal with the trauma she is still experiencing from the attack.

One of Russell’s friends started a fundraising effort on social media for her and it has raised $7,300 so far, with most of that money coming since the first news reports about Hayne’s sentence last week. Russell told WJW in Cleveland that she was pleased with Hayne’s sentence.

“She’s going to get what she deserves,” she told the station. “She didn’t get a slap on the wrist. She’s going to learn to work in fast food, and hopefully it will be good.”

In addition to the jail time and time spent working in fast food, Hayne will have to pay a $250 fine and will be on probation for two years. Gilligan told CNN he’s not sure Hayne is as sorry as she claimed to be in court, pointing out that she was still complaining about the food during the hearing.

“She still has not picked up that this is not appropriate,” Gilligan told CNN Wednesday.

328,"Harvard, Penn and MIT presidents under fire over ‘despicable’ testimony on antisemitism and genocide","New York CNN —

The presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania faced intense scrutiny on Wednesday from business leaders, donors and politicians following their testimony at a House hearing on antisemitism on campus and calls for genocide in Israel.

The criticism focused on the university leaders’ answers to questions on Tuesday about whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates their respective school’s code of conduct on bullying or harassment.

None of the school leaders explicitly said that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a post on X he was “ashamed” to hear the testimony, calling it “one of the most despicable moments in the history of US academia.”

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, speaking outside a falafel shop in Philadelphia that had been targeted by protesters, called Penn President Liz Magill’s statements “unacceptable” and “shameful.”

Shapiro called for the UPenn board of trustees to meet and discuss whether Magill’s testimony represents the values of the university and board.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told CNN’s MJ Lee Wednesday that calls for genocide at universities were “unacceptable.”

Private equity billionaire Marc Rowan wrote a message to Penn trustees saying he heard from hundreds of alumni, parents and leaders who were shocked by the hearing, including at least one who hoped the hearing was fake.

“Unfortunately, this is not fake and the University is suffering tremendous reputational damage,” Rowan wrote in the message, obtained by CNN. “How much damage to our reputation are we willing to accept?”

Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman called for Harvard President Claudine Gay, MIT President Sally Kornbluth and the University of Pennsylvania’s President Liz Magill to “resign in disgrace,” citing disgust with their testimony.

“Throughout the hearing, the three behaved like hostile witnesses,” Ackman wrote in a post on X, “exhibiting a profound disdain for the Congress with their smiles and smirks, and their outright refusal to answer basic questions with a yes or no answer.”

Ackman, a Harvard graduate who has been a vocal critic of how universities have addressed antisemitism, posted a clip from the exchange at the hearing where the university leaders were asked about calls for the genocide of Jews.

“They must all resign in disgrace. If a CEO of one of our companies gave a similar answer, he or she would be toast within the hour,” Ackman said on X. “The answers they gave reflect the profound moral bankruptcy of Presidents Gay, Magill and Kornbluth.”

In response to Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik asking whether calling for the genocide of Jews would violate Penn’s code of conduct, Penn President Magill said: “It is a context dependent decision.”

Stefanik responded with shock.

“That’s your testimony today? Calling for the genocide of Jews is dependent on the context? That is not bullying or harassment? This is the easiest question to answer yes for,” Stefanik said.

Ackman strongly criticized the response.

“Why has antisemitism exploded on campus and around the world? Because of leaders like Presidents Gay, Magill and Kornbluth who believe genocide depends on the context,” Ackman said.

The criticism of the university leaders was so strong that Harvard and Penn felt compelled to issue new statements attempting to clarify the testimony.

“There are some who have confused a right to free expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for violence against Jewish students,” Gay said in the new statement posted on X. “Let me be clear: Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.”

In a short video released Wednesday night, Magill echoed Gay’s response and said the university would immediately review and clarify its policies on hate speech.

“I was not focused on – but I should have been – the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It’s evil. Plain, and simple,” Magill said in a video posted on X. “I want to be clear: A call for genocide of Jewish people … would be harassment or intimidation.”

Magill noted antisemitic speech is designed to threaten and terrify Jews and remind them of the Holocaust, pogroms and other recent acts of violence against them.

“As president, I’m committed to a safe, secure and supportive environment so all members of our community can thrive,” Magill added. “We can – and we will – get this right.”

Representatives at MIT were not immediately available to respond to the criticism.

Condemning Harvard but forgiving Musk

Ackman has been publicly feuding with Harvard’s administration and some students over reports of rising antisemitism on campus. In an open letter last month, he said Harvard’s lack of action to rein in antisemitism threatened its funding from donors. And he called on the university to publicly name students who were members of student groups that blamed Israel for Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.

However, Ackman has gone easy on fellow billionaire Elon Musk, who endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X, leading to a revolt from advertisers. Ackman defended Musk in a post on X last week, saying, “After examining the facts, it was clear to me that Musk did not have antisemitic intent” when Musk said a conspiracy theory that Jews were trying to replace White people with immigrants was “the actual truth.”

Musk has since apologized for his post, calling it his “worst” and “dumbest” social media post.

The White House weighs in

The White House issued a full-throated condemnation of any calls for genocide Wednesday, just one day after the controversial remarks made by the presidents of Harvard, MIT and UPenn.

“What I will say is that is something that we do not stand for. We do not stand for calls for genocide, that is unacceptable, that is vile, we will call that out,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told CNN’s MJ Lee Wednesday, adding that, were administration staff found to have called for genocide, they’d be held to account.

But Jean-Pierre declined to say why university presidents testifying on Capitol Hill were unable to similarly say whether antisemitic or pro-genocide statements run afoul of their respective college codes of conduct.

“I can’t speak for those presidents, I cannot—they have to speak for themselves on this,” she said.

And she wouldn’t say if the university heads should resign following Tuesday’s backlash.

“That is not for us to decide on,” Jean-Pierre said. “Because they each… some of them are private universities, right? They have their own process, we do not get involved in private university’s process and how they run their university.”

Commitment to free speech

At one point during Tuesday’s hearing Stefanik asked Gay if the Ivy League school would punish students or applicants who say, “from the river to the sea” or “intifada.”

Gay explained that type of “hateful, reckless, offensive speech” is “abhorrent” to her.

“Do you believe that type of hateful speech is contrary to Harvard’s code of conduct or is it allowed at Harvard?” Stefanik, who graduated from Harvard, pressed Gay.

“It is at odds with the value of Harvard, but … we embrace a commitment to free expression even of views that are objectionable, offensive, hateful,” Gay said.

David Weild, a former chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market, said there should be no wavering when students feel threatened.

“I can’t believe we are having this conversation in the US Congress,” Weild said in a post on LinkedIn. “I’m a Christian. Shut the hate speech down on all sides. People deserve to feel and be safe.”","['mit', 'leaders', 'presidents', 'despicable', 'university', 'calls', 'penn', 'x', 'president', 'testimony', 'antisemitism', 'harvard', 'students', 'magill', 'genocide']","New York CNN —The presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania faced intense scrutiny on Wednesday from business leaders, donors and politicians following their testimony at a House hearing on antisemitism on campus and calls for genocide in Israel.

329,The minimum wage is increasing in more than 20 states in 2024,"New York CNN —

At the start of the new year, anyone working a minimum wage job will be paid more in 22 states and in at least 40 cities and counties across the country.

The higher hourly rates are due either to scheduled increases or lawmakers having indexed the minimum wage in their jurisdiction to inflation, most typically using the Consumer Price Index as their gauge.

Come January 1, seven states and the District of Columbia will have minimum wages of $15 or more, up from just four states plus DC this year. The newcomers to the category are Maryland, New Jersey and most of New York State (with the exception of New York City, Westchester and Long Island, which already had a $15 minimum in place and where the minimum wage is increasing to $16 in the new year).

The highest state minimum wage in 2024 will be Washington state, at $16.28, up from $15.74 currently. A close second is California, which is raising its minimum to $16 from $15.50 today.

The state with the biggest jump in its minimum wage next year will be Hawaii, which is hiking it by $2.

January 1 isn’t the only day minimum wages will go up. Some states, such as Nevada and Oregon, have increases set for July 1. Florida’s minimum will go up on September 30.

(See the full list of states increasing their minimum wages below.)

Cities, counties and some industries often trump state minimums

States’ minimum wage rates are often eclipsed by those in many of their own cities and counties.

Take the city of Tukwila, Washington, just south of Seattle. Its minimum wage will hit $20.29 in January, up from $18.99 now. At that level it will have the highest standard minimum wage rate in the country among states, counties and cities on January 1, said Jana Bjorklund, senior counsel and director of employment law and compliance at GovDocs, a compliance software provider for large, multi-jurisidiction employers.

Seattle, which will have a rate of $19.97, won’t be far behind.

Next year, at least 40 cities and counties are hiking their minimum wages, according to GovDocs. They include Flagstaff, Arizona (to $17.40); Mountain View, California (to $18.85); Denver, Colorado (to $18.29) and Portland, Maine (to $15).

And in some states, there are big sector-specific wage hikes on tap. In California, for instance, starting in April, fast food workers must be paid at least $20 an hour, and on June 1, healthcare workers will start earning between $18 and $23 an hour depending on their role and the size and type of employer they work for – an hourly rate that will eventually reach $25.

In New York City, app-based restaurant delivery workers (e.g., those working for Uber, Grubhub and DoorDash) now must be paid a minimum hourly rate of $17.96, which is set to increase to $19.96 by 2025.

The push for non-poverty wages

The federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009. And 20 states – including Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Alabama and Mississippi – still adhere to it.

The push to raise it has gone on for years because minimum wage workers stuck at $7.25 have lost substantial buying power.

Had it just been adjusted for inflation since 2009, it would be $10.33 today. But advocates for a higher minimum wage, including Holly Sklar, CEO of Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, would rather see it adjusted for inflation from where it was in 1968. The wage then was $1.60, which in today’s dollars would be $14.39. That $1.60 provided minimum wage workers with their greatest purchasing power, Sklar said. “Every minimum wage increase since 1968 has been too little too late. … Full-time jobs used to keep people out of poverty.”

She points to MIT’s living wage calculator to assess what a single person without kids would have to earn per hour just to cover the cost of basic needs (e.g., food, housing, transportation and medical care).

For example, in Mississippi, where the minimum wage is just $7.25, a person would have to earn $15.30 an hour in Pike County just to pay for basic needs. But among childcare workers, fast food cooks and cashiers in the state, the median wage (meaning half of people in those jobs earn less) ranges between $9.83 and $10.17 an hour, Sklar noted.

Given how little movement there has been at the federal level to raise the country’s minimum wage sufficiently, she expects states and local jurisdictions will continue to do the heavy lifting.

And she believes the economic case for their increases is there for both workers and employers.

For workers, of course, “It eases the burden,” Sklar said. “People replace tires they couldn’t replace or get their kids clothes.”

For businesses, she said, consumer spending goes up because minimum wage workers will spend their additional earnings quickly. And among other things, it will help boost retention of one’s workers because they won’t be as quick to quit for another 25 cents an hour. Less turnover, in turn, can reduce an employer’s hiring and training costs, among other benefits.

“It’s a virtuous cycle,” Sklar said.

330,Here’s why gas could drop below $3,"New York CNN —

The sell-off in the oil market accelerated Wednesday, with US crude prices sinking below $70 a barrel for the first time since July.

The latest wave of selling bodes well for consumers, suggesting gas prices could fall even closer towards $3 a gallon nationally.

Gas prices bottomed out at $3.10 a gallon in late December last year just before Christmas. The national average hasn’t been below $3 since May 2021.

US crude tumbled to as low as $69.11 a barrel on Wednesday, the lowest intraday level since June 29. Oil closed at $69.38 a barrel, down 4.1% on the day. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 3.8% to $74.25 a barrel.

Analysts said the selloff is being driven by a confluence of factors, including concerns about soft demand in China, record-setting supply from the United States and disappointment over last week’s OPEC+ decision.

“The market has fallen off quite rapidly,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates. “It could really be interpreted as OPEC+ losing its ability to control prices.”

Last week, OPEC+ members agreed to supply cuts but that agreement was met with skepticism because of the voluntary nature of the move.

“The OPEC+ production cuts appear to be more style than substance,” Lipow said.

All of this is welcome news for consumers. Even before Wednesday’s oil sell-off, the national average price for regular gas fell to $3.22 a gallon, according to AAA. That’s a fresh 11-month low and well below the peak in September of $3.88.

Gas prices are likely to decline another 5 to 7 cents a gallon in the next week, according to Lipow. He said while new turmoil in the Middle East or a Venezuelan takeover of Guyana could revive oil prices, there is a growing chance that US gas prices will drop towards $3 a gallon nationally.

Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities, described Wednesday’s sell-off as a “meltdown.” New federal data, revealing a large increase in weekly gasoline inventories, caused concern about weak energy demand, according to Yawger.","['according', 'drop', 'oil', 'gallon', 'heres', 'gas', 'crude', 'selloff', 'barrel', 'lipow', 'opec', 'prices']","The latest wave of selling bodes well for consumers, suggesting gas prices could fall even closer towards $3 a gallon nationally.

331,The Washington Post braces for historic 24-hour strike as journalists protest staff cuts and contract frustrations,"CNN —

Hundreds of staffers at The Washington Post are set to strike for 24 hours on Thursday, protesting recently announced cuts to the newspaper’s workforce and applying pressure on management to reach an agreement on a new union contract.

“Taking this historic action is not a decision we came to lightly,” The Washington Post Guild said in a letter to readers. “We take seriously the impact it will have on the people, issues and communities we cover.”

A protest of such magnitude has not been staged at The Post since the 1970s, according to the union, signaling how frustrated members are with the state of affairs at the Jeff Bezos-owned newspaper.

The union, which represents roughly 1,000 employees at The Post, has been negotiating a new contract with executives for 18 months, but it has yet to arrive at an agreement, much to the dismay of members who have expressed significant frustration with management over the process.

A spokesperson for The Post said in a statement that the newspaper respects the right of its employees to strike.

“We will make sure our readers and customers are as unaffected as possible,” the spokesperson said. “The Post’s goal remains the same as it has from the start of our negotiations: to reach an agreement with the Guild that meets the needs of our employees and the needs of our business.”

The labor dispute comes as The Post struggles financially, with the paper on track to lose approximately $100 million this year. To that end, The Post’s management team has moved to cut costs, announcing in October that it aims to slash its workforce by 10% through voluntary buyouts.

Patty Stonesifer, The Post’s interim chief executive, disclosed to employees when announcing the buyouts that the company had “overshot on expenses” and that management needed to “right size” the business.

Last week, Stonesifer warned employees that if 240 people do not volunteer for the buyout offer, layoffs would ensue. Stonesifer said in a meeting this week that 175 employees had so far taken the buyout offers ahead of next week’s deadline.

Staffers at The Post have balked at the need for cuts, often pointing out that the newspaper is owned by Bezos, one of the richest men in the world. Bezos has stressed that he wants The Post to be financially solvent.

During the 24-hour work stoppage, The Guild has encouraged readers to avoid reading or sharing The Post’s editorial content.

“On Dec. 7, we ask you to respect our walkout by not crossing the picket line: For 24 hours, please do not engage with any Washington Post content,” the Guild said. “That includes our print and online news stories, podcasts, videos, games and recipes.”

Meanwhile, management is working to ensure that The Post continues to deliver news to its readers during the strike. The newspaper will likely rely on its editors, who are not members of the union, to author stories.

The Post is far from the only news institution engaged in a labor dispute with its employees. Unionized staffers at Condé Nast have been protesting layoffs at the publishing company.

332,McDonald’s CEO: Bigger burgers are coming,"New York CNN —

McDonald’s has a burger strategy to spark growth in the next few years. That strategy can be boiled down to one word: More.

“In the US, in a number of markets, around the world, having a larger burger is an opportunity,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told CNN in an interview.

“We’re working on that,” he added. “That is something that you should expect in the future.”

It’s not just more burger in your burger. It’s more everything. The burger chain plans to open thousands more restaurants. It wants to add 100 million members to its loyalty program, which nudges customers into spending more. And it’s investing in more marketing campaigns to get people craving its burgers and fries — and, increasingly, chicken sandwiches, too.

Bigger burgers

McDonald’s has already been working on a plan to improve how its burger tastes. But it’s learned that in addition to softer buns and gooeyer cheese, people also want a more sizable burger.

“We’ve listened to our customers. And we understand their desire for larger, high-quality burgers that fill you up,” said Jo Sempels, who oversees markets where McDonald’s has licensed its brand, during an investor event on Wednesday.

McDonald’s plans to test options in limited markets and, once it finds the best one, roll it out more broadly, Sempels said.

That’s a similar approach to how McDonald’s landed on the McCrispy chicken sandwich, after failing for years to come up with the right recipe and branding. Now, Sempels noted, chicken amounts for $25 billion in annual sales across the system, just like beef.

McDonald’s plan for bigger burgers comes at a time when many customers are looking for ways to spend less — and as a pricey McDonald’s burger has become something of a symbol of inflation.

But the coming burger, though bigger, shouldn’t break the bank. “We think we’re going to be able to deliver a great tasting large burger at a superior value to what [customers] can get anywhere else,” Kempczinski said.

More restaurants

In addition to selling larger burgers, McDonald’s wants to be everywhere.

The burger chain plans to have 50,000 locations globally by 2027, it said in a release Wednesday. As of September 30, there were roughly 41,000 McDonald’s establishments in all.

The increase would be “the fastest period of growth in company history,” McDonald’s said in a statement.

It may seem like the global market is already saturated with fast food restaurants. But McDonald’s doesn’t see it that way: As humanity changes, the company should too — and add more restaurants, so it can maximize sales in all areas.

“With our current size and scale, some in this room might be questioning whether there is truly more space to grow,” said Manu Steijaert, the company’s global chief customer officer, during Wednesday’s event. “I’m here to tell you we see an incredible opportunity to grow the business by building more locations, getting us even closer to our customers.”

And being physically closer to customers really does matter to McDonald’s. People could get to a McDonald’s more quickly, of course. But it also means the McDonald’s can get to them more quickly, too, with shorter wait and delivery times.

The company has been looking at population forecasts in addition to “a hyper local understanding of customer demands,” to help determine how it should grow, Steijaert said.

Adding 9,000 locations in about three years will mark a sea change in the company’s pace of growth. The first McDonald’s opened in 1940. It took until the early 1970s to get to 10,000 locations, Steijaert said. And it only hit the 40,000 milestone in 2021.

Kempczinski spoke about the company’s need to evolve earlier this year.

“Our footprint reflects what the population looks like probably 20 or 30 years ago,” Kempczinski said of the company’s domestic footprint during an analyst call in July. “There’s a number of places around the US where we are significantly underdeveloped relative to where the population exists today. That opens up for us a whole bunch of development opportunities for us to go after,” he said.

Along with geographical changes, the company is also considering how the very idea of what a McDonald’s is should change as well.

Kempczinski added at the time that the company can now “[think] about small format,” because “of the growth that’s happened with the digital and delivery, where you don’t necessarily need the big dining rooms that you needed in our traditional restaurants.”

Over the summer, McDonald’s said it was testing out a new restaurant concept called “CosMc’s,” named after a little-known McDonald’s character.

As McDonald’s scales up, it’s still planning to stick to its regular formats, Kempczinski told CNN on Wednesday.

“The vast majority of what we’re going to build are going to be our traditional restaurants,” he said, which includes a dining room and a drive-thru, as well as spaces for pickup. “There probably will be some restaurants that are drive-thru and delivery only,” he said, “but that’s going to be the minority.”

More loyalty program users

In addition to the new locations, McDonald’s wants to significantly expand its loyalty program, taking it from 150 million to 250 million 90-day active users by 2027.

Loyalty programs let companies learn more about their customers’ preferences and allow them to offer specific deals that may help prevent them from going to competitors.

Getting people to commit to McDonald’s by joining a loyalty program is as important as expanding geographically, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald’s USA, said during Wednesday’s investor event.

“Historically, the number of our locations was our competitive advantage at McDonald’s,” Erlinger said Wednesday. “In the future, data will sit alongside restaurant locations as another significant competitive advantage.” Loyalty members visit restaurants more often and spend more than other customers, he noted.

A big part of the app will be about personalization fueled by artificial intelligence, Kempzcinski told CNN. On Wednesday, the company announced a partnership with Google, focusing on artificial intelligence. AI will be used behind the scenes, according to the company, and also to recommend food to customers based on what they like.

More marketing

“Maximizing our marketing remains a meaningful growth opportunity,” said Jill McDonald, who is in charge of wholly-owned international markets, during Wednesday’s event.

Marketing, she said, is driving higher sales at restaurants open at least 13 months.

One example of McDonald’s marketing success: the Grimace shake.

When McDonald’s introduced the shake, it probably didn’t expect the item to go viral on TikTok quite like it did: with TikTokers showing themselves sipping the dessert drink and then, soon after, writhing in mock pain or playing dead.

333,"This US bought a house in France for $20,000 without seeing it","CNN —

Her fascination with France began when she spent a summer in the European country while working as an au pair back back in the 1970s.

From then on, Ellen, originally from the East Coast of the US, made it her mission to travel to France whenever she got the chance to.

She met her now husband Joseph, from the West Coast, in the late 1970s and the couple went on to marry and have three children, continuing to travel to the country as a family once every two years or so.

“It’s funny, Joseph and our daughter would tease me, because anytime we were planning a vacation, I always wanted to come to France,” Ellen admits.

“They liked France too, but they would say, ‘Can we go somewhere else?’ [I would say,] ‘Yes, as long as we stop in Paris first or something like that.’ So, it was a compromise usually.”

‘Half house’

Ellen and her husband Joseph came across a rundown home in the historic village of Lonlay l'Abbaye in Normandy and purchased it unseen. Ellen and Joseph A.

Although Ellen and Joseph, who have chosen not to disclose their surname, had been toying with the prospect of moving to France for years, it wasn’t until they were both approaching retirement age that they began seriously thinking about buying a property there.

Ellen came across a tiny rundown home in the historic village of Lonlay l’Abbaye in Normandy, northern France, while browsing French real estate online, back in 2014.

“The house was affordable,” says Joseph, who previously worked as a business executive. “It was obviously a bit of a ruin. But it was within our budget.

“And that was always foremost in our minds. What can we budget? How much should we plan to spend on improvements, and so on and so forth. So, the budgetary element was pretty important for us.”

They then spent some time checking out the “charming” village on Google Street View, and eventually came across an account of two American soldiers who’d been “helped by the French Resistance in the village during World War II.”

The couple made the decision to purchase the house, which has around 400 square meters of living space, unseen, arranging for an inspector to view it beforehand.

While the property was on the market for around 18,000 euros ($19,400), Ellen and Joseph ended up purchasing it for around 13,000 euros following negotiations with the seller.

“It really wasn’t in move-in condition at all,” says Ellen, explaining that the house would need extensive work to make it liveable again. “The seller kind of agreed with that.”

Once the sale was finalized, they brought in local builders to begin demolition work on the property, overseeing things from their California home.

“They kept us informed. They would send us photographs to show us how the work was progressing,” explains Joseph. “And we would exchange ideas on how the renovation should unfold. So it worked out ok.”

The couple continued to travel to France regularly, flying over in 2015 and 2016 and checking on the progress of the work.

The following year they decided it was finally time to start the process of packing up their lives in the US and moving to France.

The first big step was applying for a long stay visa, which took a few months to finalize, then came what Joseph describes as the “wind down procedure.”

“Prior to your departure, there’s the decision to leave your homeland to go to another country, and all of the implications associated with that decision,” he notes. “All the preparation that has to be done in advance.”

They sold off many of their possessions, keeping only items of sentimental value, and set things in motion so that they could manage their affairs from France.

Big move

They completed extensive renovation work on the home over a period of nearly seven years, replacing the floors and walls, as well as the electrics and plumbing. Ellen and Joseph A.

Ellen and Joseph, who also have a property in New York, decided to rent out their home in California rather than sell it.

They then set about renting an apartment in Paris as their base while work on their Normandy home continued.

“We found that, to be in the parts of Paris that we wanted to live in, it was much less expensive to rent than it would have been to buy,” explains Ellen.

“Plus, the older that you are, the more difficult it is to get a mortgage. We would have had to have sold up and probably bought cash in Paris.”

They arrived in Paris to begin their new lives in April 2017.

Ellen and Joseph quickly set about getting to know their new community, while also traveling back and forth to Lonlay l’Abbaye to check on the renovation work.

“Each year, we budgeted for a different phase of renovation,” says Ellen, before describing how they replaced the floors, walls, electrics, and the plumbing in the home.

“We sought out good building materials and learned about ventilation and humidity issues in old stone houses.”

Ellen goes on to point out that they were able to keep the original staircase inside the house, along with a wooden cabinet that had been in the study.

While they had no choice but to get new windows and doors, they opted to replace them with replicas.

“We like to think that the ghosts of the American GIs who helped to liberate this village would still recognize our house if they walked past it on the street,” she adds.

Their goal was to both transform the tiny house into a liveable second home, and “restore it and leave it in good authentic condition for future generations.”

“We wanted to keep it looking the way it was,” says Ellen. “We didn’t want to make any big changes.”

Renovation project

""We're extremely proud of the builders, who managed to transform this from basically a small country ruin to a very liveable place,"" says Joseph. Ellen and Joseph A.

She points out that any major changes to the outside of our Normandy house had to be approved by the local authorities and the Architectes de Batiments de France, officials concerned with protecting monuments and historic areas, due to the house’s proximity to the village’s 11th century abbey.

But as the work continued to progress, the global pandemic hit, which led to renovations being halted for around two years and they were unable to travel to Normandy to visit.

Thankfully, Ellen and Joseph were able to resume work on the home once restrictions were lifted and had completed the structural work and painting by December 2021. Their new windows were installed a year later.

“We’re extremely proud of the builders, who managed to transform this from basically a small country ruin to a very liveable place,” says Joseph, adding that they’re still working on the furnishing and the “decorative side of” things.

They’d also eventually like to finish off the attic, which is currently used as storage space, and perhaps add a “half bath” up there.

Ellen and Joseph estimate that they spent a total of 65,000 euros (about $70,000) on the building works and labor, and a further 5,000 euros on appliances and furniture.

Now settled in France, they continue to flit back and forth between Paris and Lonlay l’Abbaye, stressing that they wouldn’t have it any other way.

“It’s kind of like a French Brigadoon,” Joseph says of Lonlay l’Abbaye. “There’s a certain magic to the village. The history. The Abbey. And everything is just so close. You’re surrounded by these small hills with trees and grass.

“It’s really a dramatic departure from living in a city like Los Angeles, New York or Paris.”

They’ve formed strong friendships in Lonlay l’Abbaye and travel there by train “every five or six weeks,” staying at their “half house” for a few weeks, before heading back to their rented apartment in Paris.

According to Joseph, the journey between the properties is a little over two and a half hours – their home is a 20-minute taxi ride from Flers station in Normandy.

Both feel that life in France has done wonders for them, explaining that they walk a lot more, and eat much better due to the readily available fresh produce.

“Our daughter thinks that we’ve definitely extended our lifespans by moving here,” says Ellen.

“It just seems like a much healthier lifestyle for us.”

Early on, they decided to “shoulder the responsibility” of learning French to make the transition easier, and stress that this has helped tremendously when it comes to forming bonds.

“Now 90% of all speaking that we do is in French,” says Joseph. “Even though we are far from proficient in French, it’s just something that really, really matters to us. And of course, it makes a difference to other people as well.”

However, the couple admit that they still occasionally find it daunting while attending a dinner with only French speakers who want to discuss philosophy.”

They’ve had to adapt to some of the cultural differences between the French and Americans, and say that some have been easier to get used to than the others.

For instance, Joseph points out that the French are “very, very private” in comparison to Americans, and perhaps less willing to share their lives.

“They don’t invite you to their home right away,” he notes. “They don’t address you in the first person.

“And that’s in contrast to the United States, where people are much more open with each other.”

However, Ellen acknowledges that she’s always been “more comfortable with the French frame of mind” when it comes to relating to people and forming friendships, so this has suited her fine.

“Maybe I’m just a little more introverted,” she notes.

The couple, who chronicled the renovation in an online blog, have found life in France to be more affordable than in the US, noting that their health care costs and property taxes are considerably less now.

In fact, they say the latter is roughly five to six times more on their properties in the States.

“I think that’s one reason why a lot of Americans are thinking of Europe,” says Joseph. “Because of the cost of living, and the property taxes, but also the health care.”

While they both miss living in southern California, neither has any regrets about leaving, admitting that it had become quite draining for them towards the end.

“The traffic. The craziness. And then, to some extent, politically. The divisions in the US were very stressful,” says Ellen.

“It’s not like we were having daily battles with people. But it was hard to watch. It’s still hard to watch the press from overseas and see how divided America is.

“Gee, it doesn’t feel like the America we grew up in anymore.”

They’ve gotten to explore much of France during their time there and have been enjoying learning about the different regions.

“We fully appreciate how much the French enjoy and appreciate the seasons, the moments and the food,” says Ellen. “It’s a different cultural thing, but it’s something you can appreciate.”

They say that they’d advise anyone considering a similar move to research their chosen destination carefully and refrain from trying to “replicate America” wherever they go.

“Leave some of those expectations behind,” says Ellen. “Because you don’t want to just beat your head against a brick wall, and insist on thinking like an American. Saying ‘well, this should be easy, and they should do it this way.’”

They acknowledge that spending so much time in France beforehand made things easier for them, stressing that things may have turned out differently if they had been less familiar with the country.

“We have encountered that with some friends,” says Joseph. “You [can] get some real culture clash.”

Ellen and Joseph currently have no plans to buy a place in Paris and say they’ll continue to move between their apartment in the 7th arrondissement and the countryside, perhaps spending eight months in Paris and four months in Lonlay l’Abbaye in the future.

“It’s kind of an ideal situation where you have a place to get away to. To enjoy everything that Paris has to offer, but then to also get a break from the noise and the business.”

Although they’ve returned to the US to spend time with their family and friends since relocating, they have no intention of returning to the country to live at this point, and can see themselves remaining in France for the rest of their lives.

“There are moments, of course, when we do miss a place, or something from the United States,” says Joseph.

“But this is a way of life. We’re trying to be Americans enjoying France and living here compatibly with the country.

Plus, we’ll get you in the mood before you go with movie suggestions, reading lists and recipes from Stanley Tucci.

CNN —

It’s the ‘leaning tower’ that has stood tipsily – but steadily – for nearly 1,000 years. But now, the days of the Garisenda tower in Bologna, Italy, could be numbered. Following investigations last month, the city is instigating a civil protection plan for the “sudden and unexpected collapse of the tower,” which has dominated the Bologna skyline since the 12th century.

A protective metal cordon will be erected to “contain debris resulting from a possible collapse, to reduce the vulnerability of surrounding buildings and the exposure to the population, as well as blocking access to the off-limits area,” the city council said in a statement.

The cordon will be fixed into the ground, and will include specially designed rockfall protection nets, also made of metal and also anchored to the ground.

The warning of a possible collapse was issued in a 27-page report, shared with CNN, by the scientific committee which has monitored the site since 2019.

It puts the site on “high alert” and states that experts “believe that safety conditions no longer exist to operate on or around the tower, except within the framework of a civil protection plan.”

Monitoring of the site over the past month has revealed an “unexpected and accelerated trend” of “crushing” compression to the base of the tower, with gradual disintegration of the stone used to clad the base and cracks expanding in the brick above, it says.

Consolidation works which were already underway have been halted and an exclusion zone is to be built “in the fastest time possible.”

However, the tower isn’t on the verge of immediate collapse, a spokesperson told CNN.

“We’re acting as if it’s the worst case scenario but that’s not to say it’ll happen,” he said, adding that the precautions are currently on “yellow” alert rather than red, where collapse is imminent.

“We’re acting as if it’s about to collapse, but nobody knows when that could be – it could be three months, 10 years, or 20 years.

“If there was an imminent risk of collapse we’d evacuate everyone,” he said, adding that the monitoring equipment delivers readings every 15 minutes, meaning that they should get warning of a collapse, and can evacuate the surrounding area.

One of Bologna’s famous “twin towers” which dominate the city center, the 48-meter (158 feet) Garisenda was built in the 12th century when Bologna was a mini Manhattan, with dozens of towers reaching towards the sky, each built by local families trying to construct theirs higher than the last. Today, few remain. Of those that do, many have had their tops lopped off and been converted into regular houses.

The Garisenda leans at an angle of four degrees – only a little more upright than the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s five degrees. It was already leaning by the early 14th century when Dante wrote “Inferno,” in which he described the dizzy rush of looking up at the Garisenda’s leaning side. Shortened in later years, it sits in the city center beside the Asinelli – a tower twice the height, which tourists could climb until last month.

Bologna’s mayor, Matteo Lepore, ordered the area around the towers to be blocked off in October, although the move to isolate them was for research reasons, rather than safety ones. Acoustic sensors were placed around the Garisenda to monitor cracking and creaking noises, while a pendulum was installed in both towers to track movement and see if regular “oscillation” was going above a certain threshold.

That research has now found not only increased compression in the base of the tower, but that the lean of the tower has started to shift 90 degrees, from an easterly or southeasterly direction to southwards.

The conditions have been steadily declining since July, said a spokesperson for the city council.

‘Inescapably critical condition’

An exclusion zone will now be built. Comune di Bologna

Gradual disintegration of the rock attached to the base, as well as vertical cracks in the bricks that make up the tower, have been noted since 2020 but have now worsened.

The report, which was published on November 15, confirms that the tower has been in an “inescapably critical condition for some time,” and suggests that previous interventions, including a “hoop” of steel rods and cables around the base in 2020, have aggravated the situation.

“The overall situation has unfortunately worsened considerably, with worrying implications for the overall stability of the tower,” reads the report.

“The unexpected and accelerated trend leads the committee to immediately suspend all activities currently underway (especially consolidation) and to put the site on high alert. [The committee believes] that safety conditions no longer exist to operate on or around the tower, except within the framework of a civil protection plan.”

Extreme weather events, including high temperatures this summer and flooding earlier this year, also appear to have played a part, according to the council spokesperson.

Red alert

The cordon will be finished by February. Comune di Bologna

Materials for the protective cordon will be delivered to a site near the tower within the next couple of weeks, with the works due to be completed by February, according to the council.

But anyone who was hoping that the cordon would fit in with the medieval buildings around it will be disappointed by the renderings, which show bright red barriers around the Garisenda. However, it is hopefully only temporary – the report stipulates that any anti-collapse measures must be reversible.

The council spokesperson said that once the cordon has been installed, new research will be undertaken in two phases: first to find a solution to stabilize the tower, and then to resolve the underlying problem.

He said that the first phase might mean creating a metal “cage” for the structure. The second phase is causing more debate.

“Some say let’s dismantle it, redo the base and rebuild it. Others say let’s trim it [the tower itself] as was done in the medieval period. These are all hypotheses that we’re studying – the tower is nearly 1,000 years old and there’s no rulebook,” he said.

The works won’t come cheap – the cordon alone will cost 4.4 million euros (about $4.8 million), and any stabilizing work will cost “millions and millions,” said the spokesperson. The council has set up an online fundraiser with an aim of raising 3 million euros. It has already raised 800,000 euros in a week.

“The twin towers are one of the symbols of the city, along with the [UNESCO-protected] porticoes,” said the spokesperson.

“This isn’t just about saving a heritage site; it also has a very strong symbolic value.”","['leaning', 'protection', 'city', 'collapse', 'garisenda', 'high', 'spokesperson', 'italy', 'alert', 'cordon', 'towers', 'bologna', 'tower', 'base', 'site']","CNN —It’s the ‘leaning tower’ that has stood tipsily – but steadily – for nearly 1,000 years.

335,Harvey Lewis set a backyard ultramarathon record by running 450 miles for four and a half days – while barely sleeping,"CNN —

There came a moment, somewhere on a roadside in rural Tennessee, when Harvey Lewis felt like he could keep running forever.

At this point, he had already been on the move, practically non-stop, for about four days, looping around the same roads, trails, and tracks amongst an ever-shrinking group of runners.

He was battling through feverish sleep deprivation on leaden, depleted legs, and on the front of his sweat-stained vest he wore the splattered evidence of an earlier nosebleed.

But looks can be deceiving, and deep in the corner of his stubborn mind, Lewis knew that he held the golden ticket to winning this backyard ultramarathon race: ensure that every other competitor quits before you.

As the race wore on, he began to feel unstoppable.

“It was like a frequency I found with my rhythm and my pace,” says Lewis, “where I could just maintain that for an incredible amount of time.

“There was some sort of place where my brain took over … and the body finally surrendered to my mind.”

This was at Big’s Backyard Ultra in October, the world championships of backyard ultrarunning.

The discipline of ultrarunning is broadly defined as any distance beyond the 26.2 miles of a marathon, but a backyard ultra has no predetermined length. Runners complete a 4.167-mile loop on the hour, every hour until only one person is left standing. The other competitors are deemed not to have finished, either by dropping out or failing to complete a loop within the cut-off time.

Lewis, a high school teacher and seasoned distance runner from Cincinnati, entered uncharted territory as far as backyard ultras are concerned, completing a scarcely believable 108 loops – the equivalent of 450 miles – over four and a half days at Big’s.

His gargantuan feat of endurance and resilience eventually came to an end when his final competitor, Ihor Verys, failed to complete his 108th loop, becoming what’s known in backyard ultrarunning as “the assist.”

Several weeks later, Lewis is still trying to get his head around his world record – six laps, or 25 miles, more than Australian Phil Gore’s managed at a backyard ultra earlier this year.

“I managed to pull off stretching it to four and a half days,” Lewis tells CNN Sport. “That’s really kind of riveting to me. It sparks my imagination.”

In total, Lewis covered the equivalent of the entire length of Florida, or about the distance from his hometown Cincinnati to Atlanta, stopping only for a few minutes between each loop.

He was midway through his final loop when it suddenly dawned on him that Verys had finally succumbed to the race’s gauntlet of pain, handing Lewis the victory as long as he could haul himself to the cut-off one last time.

“Finishing the final person, you’re on cloud nine,” the 47-year-old Lewis says. “It’s like one of the biggest highs of my life. I couldn’t describe it, especially when it’s such a rigorous, challenging goal.”

There are hundreds of backyard ultras staged around the world each year, but Big’s is the discipline’s original and most famous event.

The concept was devised by Gary Cantrell, the gatekeeper of some of the world’s most punishing foot races, including the fabled Barkley Marathons. Better known as Lazarus Lake, or simply “Laz” to those in the ultrarunning community, Cantrell first staged Big’s around his farm in Bell Buckle in 2011.

The race consists of two different loops: one on trails during the day and another on roads during the night. The start and end of each loop is marked by an overhead structure which reads “there is no finish,” the first three words written by hand and pinned to the banner in crude fashion.

It is there that runners must congregate at the top of the hour, every hour in order to stay in the race.

“It’s a tribute to a human’s ability to just continually push that boundary of what’s possible further and further out,” Cantrell says in a video promoting the event.

Lewis, now a two-time winner and three-time assist, is a dedicated disciple of Big’s. He credits success in this year’s race to a combination of careful preparation, his previous experience on the course and at many other ultramarathons, and sheer force of will in the closing stages.

“I always believed that I was going to still be the final person, and I never lost the vision of that,” says Lewis.

His training for this year’s race was at times peculiar, especially when it came to managing sleep deprivation. During his lunchtime breaks at school, Lewis would roll out a yoga mat in a storage closet and try to fall asleep for three to five minutes as quickly as possible, simulating the short breaks he would get between loops at Big’s.

Other times, he says that he would run to the park and lie down on the grass for several minutes.

Come the race itself, Lewis’ sleep strategy hardly went to plan. Unable to quiet his mind the night before, he only slept for three hours and then didn’t sleep at all for the first three days of the race. After that, he was able to switch off for one or two minutes between loops.

Thankfully, he wasn’t derailed by the same “incredibly intense hallucinations” that plagued him during a backyard ultra in Australia earlier in the year.

“I actually saw these grass people and the trees came alive,” Lewis recalls. “I would fall asleep for just a second, my sense of sound was super accented. It was like that show ‘Stranger Things.’”

His strategy if he gets similar hallucinations in another race? “I feel like I would be able to, like, just run through that,” Lewis adds. “It would maybe make it very interesting.”

That’s not to say that his sanity remained entirely intact at Big’s: on the fourth day, he started to talk gibberish to the other competitors.

“I was semi-conscious, semi-dreaming, and I would just start to say random things,” says Lewis. “I had to censor myself and not just say whatever I was thinking in my dreamlike running state.”

He estimates that he consumed more than 40,000 calories during the race, all of which was plant-based – something Lewis says helped to settle his stomach when eating on the move.

His race diet was varied and plentiful: avocado and hummus wraps, lentil soup, peanut noodles, vegan mac and cheese, vegan yoghurt, cupcakes, and different fruits – blueberries, mangoes, watermelon – were all on the menu.

He also never drank water on the course, instead opting for fluids with calories like coconut water, Coke, or electrolyte drinks.

“I was always grazing on foods,” says Lewis, “enjoying my appetite and enjoying the smorgasbord.”

An upset stomach is one of myriad challenges a runner might face at Big’s. Another is the risk of a fall – particularly on the roots, rocks, and foliage found on the day-time loop around Cantrell’s farm – while rattlesnakes and copperheads can also make for alarming bystanders on the trails.

Lewis fell just once, evidenced by the reddish marks that appeared on the side of his head towards the end of the race. “I’m pretty good at falling,” he explains. “I’ve fallen a lot in my lifetime.”

How a runner responds to adversity can be crucial at determining how long they survive at Big’s. Lewis figures that the effort required in the race is about 70% mental and 30% physical, and he has developed unique ways of hardening his mind during backyard ultras.

“I have spirit animals that I like to embody in the race,” says Lewis. “With Big’s, I was saying that my spirit animal was the honey badger. The honey badger can be knocked down, beaten, bitten, cut – everything happening to it and the honey badger just keeps on going.”

The honey badger analogy can also be extended to Lewis’ ultrarunning career as a whole, his progress in the sport gutsy and gradual. He says that he achieved the qualification time for the Boston Marathon after 17 years of trying and won an ultramarathon 13 years after competing in his first.

He describes himself as a “chubby” kid growing up – quite the contrast to the man who these days runs to and from work, adding extra distance as he builds up to a race.

“It was an ultra to get to where I am today,” says Lewis.

He was running Big’s to raise money for the Brighton Center, an organization in Northern Kentucky which helps individuals and families to achieve financial stability and independence, and also wants to inspire people to invest more in their personal health – even if that means getting outdoors for 20 or 30 minutes each day.

And in terms of his personal goals, Lewis has started to reflect on what it might be possible to achieve in the backyard ultra format.

“If the opportunity comes again: how will I be able to go through that fifth night?” he muses. “How will I come out on that sixth day, and then will we get back to another night?”

Four and a half days and 450 miles might just be the start for Harvey Lewis. This is, after all, a race with no finish line.","['record', 'lewis', 'days', 'ultramarathon', 'sleep', 'minutes', 'loop', 'set', 'harvey', 'backyard', 'sleeping', 'running', 'ultrarunning', 'race', 'half', 'miles', 'ultra', 'bigs']","“There was some sort of place where my brain took over … and the body finally surrendered to my mind.”This was at Big’s Backyard Ultra in October, the world championships of backyard ultrarunning.

336,"UK government signs Hillsborough Charter, acknowledges ‘multiple injustices’ suffered by soccer stadium disaster victims","CNN —

The UK government has signed the Hillsborough Charter, acknowledging “multiple injustices” and vowing that no families will suffer the same fates as the relatives of the victims from the infamous soccer ground tragedy.

Ninety-seven Liverpool supporters died as a result of the April 1989 disaster at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, England.

“The Charter, which the Government has signed, seeks to ensure that the lessons of the Hillsborough disaster and its aftermath are learned, to prevent those who are affected by public tragedy in the future from having the same experience,” UK Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said in a statement on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons: “The Hillsborough families have suffered multiple injustices and, more than 34 years later, there can never be too many apologies for what they have been through.

“And I want to repeat that apology today, and thank the Hillsborough families for their tenacity, patience and courage.”

The government was responding to a 2017 report, published by former Liverpool Bishop James Jones, which consulted the families on lessons from the stadium disaster and made 25 recommendations which could help shape the response to future disasters.

Among those recommendations was a call for the creation of a special charter that would see public bodies act transparently and in the public interest.

The government’s charter also promises to implement a “duty of candour” for policing in England and Wales, which aims to promote a culture of honesty and transparency during investigations and inquiries.

337,"The Hughes brothers had a historic night on the ice, playing in the same game for the first time as New Jersey Devils win","CNN —

The Hughes family had quite a night on the ice as brothers Jack and Luke faced off against sibling Quinn as the New Jersey Devils defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6-5 at Rogers Arena on Tuesday.

It was the first time that the trio had all played in the same NHL game, and only the ninth time in NHL history that three brothers had taken to the ice at the same time.

According to the NHL, it was the second time an American family had three brothers play in the same game, and the first since 1990 when Neal and Aaron Broten of the Minnesota North Stars played against their brother Paul and the New York Rangers.

The trio, whose parents were in attendance at Rogers Arena, were able to take a historic photo together at center ice before the game.

“Getting a picture in warm-ups was really good,” said the 20-year-old Luke. “Haven’t really let it sink in yet. Just seeing [Quinn] off ice. I hadn’t seen him for a couple of months.”

The 24-year-old Quinn had two assists for the Canucks, giving him 36 points for the season, the most in the league for a defenseman. Luke and the 22-year-old Jack both scored for the Devils. Jack also picked up two assists.

“Of course you dream you’re going to play with your brothers in the NHL one day,” Jack told the NHL website before the game. “You’re in the basement, hanging out, playing, but you never really think it’s going to become a reality. For it to happen, it’s definitely pretty wild. It’s three kids in one game.

If much of the focus was on the Hughes siblings, Jesper Bratt’s contribution proved key with goals from the Swedish winger bookending the scoring, with a late one-timer off a rebound with 34 seconds left sealing the victory for New Jersey.

The Devils raced into a 5-2 lead through the first two periods but the Canucks came back into the game in the third as goals by Brock Boeser, Sam Lafferty and Nils Hoglander tied things up before Bratt’s last-minute winner.

“Pretty good in the first two [periods] and then pretty ugly in the third,” said Jack, summing up his team’s performance after the game. “But we found a way to win so that’s all that matters.”

“It’s tough now,” Quinn said when asked if he could appreciate playing against his brothers. “I’m sure they’re appreciating it more than I am right now, but it’s very cool. Looking back the next couple of days or months, it’d be a cool one.”

The Hughes brothers are no strangers to making history. Quinn was drafted seventh overall in 2018, Jack went first overall in 2019 and Luke came off the board at fourth overall in 2021, meaning that each brother was selected inside the top seven in an unprecedented feat.

Jack entered Tuesday’s game leading the league in points per game with 1.76, while Quinn came in at fourth overall in league scoring, per the Devils.

“They’ve put their name on notice throughout the League,” said Devils winger Tyler Toffoli ahead of Tuesday’s game. “The three of them are all extremely good players.

With Quinn and Jack being completely established and superstars already and Luke not far behind them.”

Though this was the first time that all three siblings had taken part in the same game, it was the seventh time that Quinn and Jack had faced off. Jack has frequently gotten the better of the matchup, with the Devils having a 6-1-0 record in these clashes.","['hughes', 'luke', 'night', 'nhl', 'quinn', 'overall', 'jersey', 'game', 'ice', 'jack', 'devils', 'league', 'win', 'brothers', 'historic', 'playing']","CNN —The Hughes family had quite a night on the ice as brothers Jack and Luke faced off against sibling Quinn as the New Jersey Devils defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6-5 at Rogers Arena on Tuesday.

338,Copa América 2024: CONMEBOL announces 14 host cities as tournament returns to the US,"CNN —

CONMEBOL, South America’s soccer federation, has announced the 14 cities that will host matches at the 2024 Copa América as the tournament returns to the United States for the first time since 2016.

The 14 cities are Las Vegas (NV), Arlington (TX), Charlotte (NC), Orlando (FL), Miami Gardens (FL), Santa Clara (CA), Atlanta (GA), East Rutherford (NJ), Houston (TX), Austin (TX), Inglewood (CA), Glendale (AZ), Kansas City (KS) and Kansas City (MO).

The tournament opener will be played at Atlanta United’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium, with the final taking place at Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium.

It will be only the second time, after the special centenary Copa América in 2016, that the tournament has been hosted outside of South America.

Ecuador was originally designated as the tournament host but pulled out in November 2022 due to economic and security concerns, as well as a lack of viable stadiums.

That reportedly left just the US and Peru as the two nations willing to host the 2024 edition, with CONMEBOL and CONCACAF – the federation for North America, Central America and the Caribbean – jointly choosing the US in January of this year.

Though the US unquestionably has better stadium infrastructure than any South American nation, the decision to once again host the tournament stateside led to some criticism in Latin America.

“South America is having a hard time organizing its historic national team tournament,” Ezequiel Fernández Moores wrote in Argentine outlet La Nación in February.

CONMEBOL has encountered obstacles in hosting the last three editions of the Copa América held in South America. In 2015, the host nation was changed from Brazil to Chile due to the former already hosting the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.

Colombia was set to co-host the 2020 edition with Argentina, before it was postponed by a year due to the Covid pandemic. Protests across the country the following year led to Colombia withdrawing as co-host, with Argentina following suit soon after as the country grappled with high Covid cases.

The tournament was eventually moved to Brazil and played behind closed doors.

Now, for the third edition in a row, the host nation has been changed after the US took over organizing duties from Ecuador.

However, Fernández Moores questioned why the same scrutiny, particularly around safety, isn’t applied to the United States.

“It doesn’t matter that games can be played in California, the State that has just suffered four mass shootings in just 10 days in January,” Fernández Moores wrote.

“For the third year in a row, the United States suffered more than six hundred mass shootings in 2022. In the first three weeks of 2023, there have already been 39 shootings.

“It is unthinkable that CONMEBOL for its 2024 Copa América or FIFA for its 2026 World Cup would demand that the United States review its festival of naturalized violence, which kills in shopping malls, schools or on any street.”

But hosting the 2024 Copa América is undoubtedly a huge boost for the USA as the country gears up to jointly host the 2026 World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico.

In a country where soccer is still sometimes played in the shadows of the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL, a successful tournament for the US Men’s National Team could play a huge role in boosting national interest ahead of 2026.

The 2016 edition was an overwhelming success, too, registering a record average attendance of 46,000 and becoming the most lucrative Copa América to date, according to La Nación.

Coupled with Lionel Messi’s arrival at Inter Miami, which has garnered worldwide attention and caused spikes in ticket sales and attendances, the 2024 Copa América could prove to be a perfect warm-up of sorts for both organizers and fans alike.

Messi’s matches for Inter Miami have drawn star-studded crowds, while tickets – for both home and away games – are in huge demand, although the club has received criticism for hiking season ticket prices for next year and pricing out fans who had been loyal to the team prior to Messi’s arrival.

It’s unclear whether Messi’s stateside adventure will boost soccer’s popularity in the US long-term, but perhaps few people will care as long as there is plenty of money to be made while he’s still in Miami.

But the Argentine’s arrival hasn’t just boosted the coffers. His utterly dominant performances on the pitch – which have at times looked laughably easy – led Inter Miami to its first title in the club’s five-year history by helping the team win the Leagues Cup just months after joining.

Such has been his influence in 2023 after guiding Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of 2022, Messi was named TIME’s Athlete of the Year on Tuesday.

“At 36, two decades into his unparalleled career, Messi provided a singular stimulus to soccer in America. Attendance, ticket prices, merchandise sales, and viewership soared. His games took on the feel of a religious revival,” Sean Gregory wrote in TIME.

“With the US hosting three major international tournaments in the next three years (Copa América in 2024, the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025, and the grandest of them all, the World Cup, in 2026), it’s sure to attract even more fans. But Messi is an accelerant.

“With the most revered and influential athlete on the planet playing in Miami for at least the next two years, still performing at the top of his game – he won another Ballon d’Or as the world’s player of the year, his eighth, in late October – the US is now a soccer nation. A fútbol nation.”","['host', 'cities', '14', 'copa', 'tournament', 'america', 'nation', 'américa', 'world', 'announces', '2024', 'cup', 'returns', 'conmebol', 'miami']","CNN —CONMEBOL, South America’s soccer federation, has announced the 14 cities that will host matches at the 2024 Copa América as the tournament returns to the United States for the first time since 2016.

339,Aaron Rodgers criticizes ‘character assassination’ of Jets teammate Zach Wilson,"CNN —

New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has criticized what he calls the “character assassination” of his teammate, Zach Wilson, in the media following reports that the former No. 2 overall pick was reluctant to retake the starting position after being benched earlier in the season.

According to the report from The Athletic, citing multiple team sources, the Jets want Wilson to return as the team’s starting quarterback for their Week 14 game against the Houston Texans after experimenting with Tim Boyle and Trevor Siemian in the position, but the third-year signal-caller was hesitant to do so “due to perceived injury risk.”

Rodgers, who suffered a torn Achilles just four snaps into his stint in New Jersey, said that he believed the report was “chickensh*t at its core,” adding that he “loves” Wilson.

“First of all, you can go down a whole rabbit hole with actual sources, made up sources, why is someone willing to be a source?” Rodgers said during his weekly appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” on Tuesday. “What are they gaining out of that?

“On and on and on, but when you use sources and, whether intentional or unintentional, try to assassinate someone’s character like that report does for Zach, I have a real hard time with that.”

The 40-year-old continued: “How can you read it any other way? You’re basically saying this kid is quitting on the team and doesn’t want to play and is giving the middle finger to the organization.

“I don’t want to speak for him. He’s going to get a chance this week to speak and I’m going to let him speak. … (But) he’s gone through a lot of sh*t in the last three years and he’s got every right to be frustrated and disappointed about it.”

CNN has reached out to Wilson to offer him the right of reply to the report. Wilson has not publicly responded to The Athletic’s reporting and is scheduled to speak to the media on Thursday.

Earlier this week, Jets head coach Robert Saleh was non-committal when asked about who would start at quarterback for his team’s Week 14 game against the Houston Texans on Sunday, though he denied reports that Wilson is reluctant to retake the starting position.

“Let’s be clear, if [Wilson] was reluctant to play, he wouldn’t be here,” said Saleh on Monday. “I actually coincidentally just got done speaking with him. He came in about a half hour ago and we had a really good conversation.

“The young man wants the ball. He wants to start. He believes he’s the best quarterback in the room and the best quarterback for this team and the guy who gives us the best chance to win,” added Saleh.

“We’re in a society now where kids miss bowl games because they’re worried about their draft status, right?” said Saleh. “So empathetically, if that discussion had been had somewhere, and again it wasn’t with me, but if that conversation was had and it somehow leaked out to the media, I don’t think that’s indicative of his mindset. The kid wants to play.”

The Athletic story quoted anonymous sources talking about Wilson’s reluctance to return as the Jets’ starter.

Four-time NFL MVP Rodgers expressed his displeasure of the culture of anonymous leaks from within the Jets organization.

“We need to get to the bottom of whatever this is coming from and put a stop to it, privately, because there’s no place in a winning culture where – and this isn’t the only time; there’s been a bunch of other leaks.”

Rodgers added: “Some conversations are only meant for certain people and shouldn’t leave the building.

“There’s a trust that goes along with being in the locker room, where you say something to your homie and that sh*t doesn’t go anywhere. Or you say something in the team meeting room [and it] doesn’t go anywhere. There’s been too many instances this season where stuff is happening. It’s not OK, and we need to weed it out in whatever way necessary.”

CNN has offered the Jets a right of reply regarding Rodgers’ comments about anonymous leaks from within the organization.

Seeking their first postseason berth since 2010, the Jets – who waived Boyle on Tuesday and signed Brett Rypien from the Seattle Seahawks’ practice squad – were given a glimmer of hope last week when Rodgers was cleared to practice, despite the initial expectation that he would be out for the remainder of the season.

However, it is still unclear when he will be able to play, if at all, this season.","['sources', 'speak', 'quarterback', 'assassination', 'right', 'team', 'character', 'aaron', 'week', 'teammate', 'wilson', 'jets', 'report', 'rodgers', 'zach', 'criticizes']","CNN —New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has criticized what he calls the “character assassination” of his teammate, Zach Wilson, in the media following reports that the former No.

340,"Rembrandt painting once valued at $15,000 sells for almost $14 million at Sotheby’s auction","Editor’s Note: This article was updated with the final sale price and other details following the auction’s conclusion.

London CNN —

A painting valued at $15,000 just two years ago fetched almost £11 million ($13.8 million) at a Sotheby’s auction on Wednesday after being identified as the work of the Dutch master Rembrandt.

“Adoration of the Kings” had been virtually unseen since the 1950s, when it first came to light. It was acquired by collector J.C.H. Heldring in Amsterdam in 1955. His widow sold it to a German family in 1985, where it remained until it was sold by Christie’s in Amsterdam two years ago.

At the time of that sale, Christie’s attributed the biblical scene to the “Circle of Rembrandt,” suggesting it had been carried out by a student or an artist close to the famous painter, and estimated its value at between €10,000 and €15,000 (then around $10,600 to $15,900).

Extensive tests revealed changes that Rembrandt had made to the painting. Sotheby's

The monochromatic painting, which measures 9.6 x 7.3 inches, was purchased by an anonymous buyer for €860,000 (then around $910,000) at the Christie’s sale — more than 50 times the painting’s estimated value at the time. It was later identified as “a work of great significance” by the Dutch painter, according to a Sotheby’s press release published prior to Wednesday’s sale.

After the anonymous buyer consigned it to Sotheby’s, the auction house embarked on an 18-month research project to arrive at the painting’s true attribution and value.

The examination, which involved X-rays and infrared imaging, as well as intensive discussions with leading Rembrandt scholars, led Sotheby’s to conclude the painting is “an autograph work by Rembrandt.” Prior to the sale, the auction house gave the work an estimated value of £10 million to £15 million ($12.6 million to $18.8 million).

The auction house believes it was painted early in Rembrandt’s career, around 1628, when he would have been aged 21 or 22 and living in the Dutch city of Leiden.

A rare find

The vast majority of Rembrandt’s works hang in museums around the world, and almost all of those that have come to auction over the past three decades “have been portraits or studies of single character heads,” according to the Sotheby’s release.

As such, “Adoration of the Kings,” which depicts the encounter between the Three Wise Men and the baby Jesus, represented a “fantastic opportunity” in the art world, George Gordon, co-chairman of Old Master Paintings Worldwide at Sotheby’s, told CNN prior to the sale.

In a phone call with CNN, he said: “I would say that it’s particularly significant because it adds to our understanding of Rembrandt at this crucial date in his development and career, when he was clearly very ambitious and developing very quickly as an artist.”

The earliest reference to the painting appears to be from the 1714 inventory of a collector in Amsterdam, Constantijn Ranst. It was then offered for sale in 1814 and again in 1822, after which it disappeared from view until the mid-20th century.

It was included in museum exhibitions and referenced as a Rembrandt work by leading Rembrandt scholars in the 1950s, but in 1960 German art historian Kurt Bauch, who only knew the painting from a black and white photograph, described it as a product of the Rembrandt School and omitted it from from the catalogue raisonné he was compiling. Thereafter, the painting was “entirely overlooked and completely ignored in the Rembrandt literature,” according to Sothebys.

Gordon told CNN that those bidding at the Christie’s auction in 2021 “must have thought it was much better than the description and that it might well be a Rembrandt.”

Sotheby’s close examination revealed a number of changes and revisions that Rembrandt made, including to the baby Jesus’ halo and the Virgin Mary’s headdress, according to the auction house.

“Very few narrative paintings by Rembrandt remain in private hands, making this an opportunity for a private collector or an institution that is as rare as it is exciting,” Gordon had said in the news release.

“This sophisticated painting is in equal measure a product of Rembrandt’s brush and his intellect. All the hallmarks of his style in the late 1620s are evident both in the visible painted surface and in the underlying layers revealed by science, showing multiple changes in the course of its creation, and casting fresh light on how he thought,” he added.","['14', 'valued', 'paintings', 'sothebys', 'million', 'auction', 'rembrandt', '15000', 'cnn', 'christies', 'painting', 'work', 'sale', 'sells']","London CNN —A painting valued at $15,000 just two years ago fetched almost £11 million ($13.8 million) at a Sotheby’s auction on Wednesday after being identified as the work of the Dutch master Rembrandt.

342,Florence Nightingale: ‘Final’ photos of nursing pioneer up for auction,"London CNN —

Photos thought to be among the last taken of Florence Nightingale are among a number of items related to the famed English nurse going up for auction in London.

The small, sepia images were taken by Eliza Francis “Fanny” Pettit, who was Nightingale’s companion late in her life, and show the nurse sitting in an armchair, according to auction house Roseberys.

They measure just 5.9 x 5.9 centimeters (2.3 x 2.3 inches) and were taken around 1910. Nightingale died on August 13 of that year, at age 90.

“The family history behind these photographs leads us to believe that they may be the final images taken of Nightingale,” Jack Wallis, a works of art specialist at Roseberys, told CNN.

“We can be certain that they were taken in 1910, and as such almost certainly in the final weeks or months of Nightingale’s life,” he said. The photos were exclusively exhibited at the Florence Nightingale Museum in London, confirming their authenticity, Wallis added.

“What makes them so special is their personal, candid nature - they are informal shots captured for posterity by a close friend to remember a much-loved principal,” he said.

Born in 1820, Nightingale was an English nurse who became the first woman to receive the Order of Merit, for her efforts treating wounded soldiers during the 1853-1856 Crimean War. She became famous as the “Lady with the Lamp” because of her reputation for making rounds at night to check on the patients.

Nightingale went on to play a key role in formalizing education for nurses, setting up the Nightingale School of Nursing at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London in 1860.

International Nurses Day is celebrated every year on May 12, Nightingale’s birthday, in her honor.

Other items in Thursday’s sale include a travel teapot and silver-plated tea caddy, given to Pettit by Nightingale, as well as a letter written by housekeeper Elizabeth Bosanquet detailing the last hours of Nightingale’s life.

In the letter, Bosanquet invited Pettit to visit “to look on Miss Nightingale’s peaceful face.”

“She passed away quietly at 2pm yesterday resting on her pillows just as she had been placed the night before,” it reads, according to Roseberys.

“It was very peaceful and merciful and one is so thankful she slept away with no suffering,” Bosanquet wrote. “We shall all be the better for her wonderful influence.”

Wallis said that “it is very rare for a collection of this nature to come to market, particularly in relation to an icon of British history such as Florence Nightingale.”

“The collection really paints a picture of Nightingale’s character and the last days of her life,” he said.

343,Opinion: US must send tougher message to Iran’s proxies in the Middle East,"Editor’s note: Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

CNN —

US military forces once again confronted aggressive, potentially deadly moves by Iran-allied militias in the Middle East over the weekend. It’s further evidence that American efforts to deter these militias’ dangerous, persistent belligerence are simply not working. The message to Iran is not getting through.

Frida Ghitis CNN

On Sunday, explosions rocked the Red Sea¸ the narrow but pivotal body of water that connects Europe to the Middle East and Asia. Yemen’s Houthi militias, closely allied with Iran, were firing missiles at commercial vessels and possibly at US naval ships, so the United States fired back, shooting down drones, repeating a now familiar but increasingly perilous cycle that threatens to escalate with potentially ominous consequences.

The USS Carney responded amid a series of four attacks by the Houthis, according to US Central Command. Most of the militia’s targets were civilian cargo ships, but, worryingly, at least one armed drone was “headed toward Carney although its specific target is not clear,” the US statement said.

The continuing attacks by militias allied with Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, targeting US forces across the Middle East along with civilian vessels, are posing an untenable dilemma for the Biden administration.

The White House wisely wants to prevent the war between Israel and Hamas — like the Houthis a member of Iran’s “axis of resistance” — from expanding into a regional conflict. But Iran’s proxies are relentlessly taunting the Americans. Iran’s partners have launched at least 76 separate attacks against US forces in Syria and Iraq since mid-October, a defense official told CNN. They attack American targets almost daily.

The Biden administration is trying to modulate its response, hitting back hard enough to deter Iran with multiple strikes against a variety of targets — killing Iran-backed militia members in Iraq this weekend, striking IRGC weapons depots in Syria, warning Hezbollah in Lebanon to think twice before jumping in — but not so hard that it falls into the trap of getting involved in another war, which neither President Joe Biden nor any responsible person in America wants.

Iran knows that.

Some Republicans are critical of the Biden administration for not doing more to prevent the attacks by the Houthis and other Iran proxies. Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, a Democrat, recently urged a more aggressive approach as well.

As Israel and Hamas battle each other, Iran is showcasing its defiance, trying to flex its muscle, highlighting its geographic reach across several Mideast countries, perhaps seeking to intimidate other regional rivals, along with Israel and even the United States. By keeping its own uniformed fighters largely out of the fray, Tehran has plausible deniability about its involvement in the attacks.

Few are fooled. Central Command’s statement on Sunday declared that the US believes the Houthi attacks “are fully enabled by Iran.”

For the Houthis, these violent expressions of solidarity with Hamas constitute an opportunity to burnish their standing among the Arab and Muslim publics, who are siding strongly with the Palestinians.

Whatever the motivation, the continuing attacks, and the escalating threats to civil navigation cannot be allowed to stand.

One of the most urgent items on the agenda is stabilizing conditions on the Red Sea. Look at a map. The Red Sea is the channel that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the rest of the Middle East and Asia. Any commerce between China, India or other Asian countries with Europe or the US East Coast has to pass through the Suez Canal that links the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The Houthis pose a grave threat to international commerce and the global economy, not to mention regional stability.

The US and NATO should assertively defend freedom of navigation. The Houthis, an Iran-armed organization, needs to be confronted before a disaster at sea sends shockwaves of disruption across the global economy.

In the first place, Houthis must be designated as a terrorist organization once again.

Last month, the Biden administration revealed that it is reviewing “potential terrorist designations” for the Shia extremist group. Already members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, are urging the administration to do just that.

The move would confirm the shift in the administration’s geopolitical stance and the waning influence on Biden’s foreign policy by progressive forces within the Democratic Party.

In February 2021, just a month after Biden’s inauguration, one of the first acts of Secretary of State Antony Blinken was lifting the Houthis’ designation as a terrorist group.

The decision was remarkable because the State Department’s announcement confirmed that the Houthis are, in fact, terrorists, noting that the group formally known as Ansarallah, was “kidnapping and torturing citizens of the United States and many of our allies, diverting humanitarian aid, brutally repressing Yemenis.”

Still, the war between the Houthi rebels and the government they sought to unseat in Yemen, backed by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia, had become a major humanitarian catastrophe. Progressive figures argued that lifting the terrorist designation — regardless of its accuracy — would save lives.

In those days, the Biden administration was trying to cool relations with Saudi Arabia, a plan that later also went into reverse.

That the Houthis are terrorists is beyond dispute. They have imprisoned and tortured countless Yemenites and foreigners. Human rights organizations have thoroughly documented their violations. They have crushed women’s rights, imprisoning and torturing women, prompting critics to suggest Yemen is headed in Afghanistan’s Taliban direction. They’ve gone after journalists, sentencing them to death before subjecting them to torture, and routinely abusing other civilians while blocking humanitarian assistance from reaching them.

Their insurgency rose out of the remote Saada governorate of Yemen, where the ethnic Houthis practice Zaidi Shia Islam. The Houthis accused the government of then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh of corruption and of being too close to Saudi Arabia and the United States.

Supported, armed and trained by Iran, they adopted the very revealing anti-American and antisemitic slogan, “God is greatest (Allahu Akbar), death to America, death to Israel, cursed be the Jews, victory to Islam.”

The Houthis say their attacks will continue until Israel stops its campaign in Gaza. But, like Hamas, Iran, Hezbollah and other members of the so-called axis of resistance, they oppose any permanent reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians and support Israel’s destruction.

Since the October 7 Hamas massacre of Israelis that triggered the current war, the Houthis have seized a Japan-chartered cargo ship, and they have targeted a UK-owned and operated vessel, among others. They also fired ballistic missiles toward the USS Mason as the American Navy ship responded to a distress call from another civilian ship under attack.

In addition, the Houthis have launched guided missiles toward Israeli cities. American and Israeli defensive weapons have shot those down, but these moves raise the troubling question of what would ensue if a Yemeni missile hit an Israeli city.

Formally designating the Houthis a terrorist organization would provide moral clarity and prevent the Houthis from using US financial institutions and other facilities, and it would be unlikely to have negative humanitarian repercussions.

The brutal civil war that plunged Yemen’s civilians into a catastrophe is winding down after a 2022 ceasefire. Like other Iran-linked militias, the Houthis remain a source of instability, propelled by an uncompromising and repressive ideology.

Their actions, and those of other militias that are repeatedly attacking US forces require a more forceful response. The United States needs to continue calibrating its pushback carefully, but the current level is not sending the necessary message that the attacks must stop.","['sea', 'terrorist', 'tougher', 'opinion', 'attacks', 'militias', 'middle', 'east', 'united', 'biden', 'send', 'war', 'irans', 'iran', 'message', 'houthis', 'red', 'proxies']","Frida Ghitis CNNOn Sunday, explosions rocked the Red Sea¸ the narrow but pivotal body of water that connects Europe to the Middle East and Asia.

344,Opinion: What do you expect when an oil executive runs the climate talks?,"Editor’s Note: John D. Sutter is a climate journalist and nonfiction filmmaker. He is the Ted Turner Visiting Professor of Environmental Media at the George Washington University. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

As someone who’s been reporting on the climate crisis for more than a decade, I can say that the most insidious threat to climate action isn’t denial or apathy.

John D. Sutter Beth Mickalonis

It’s doubt and confusion.

That’s why the news from COP28 in Dubai is so infuriating.

The COP — an international peer-pressure meeting meant to avert disastrous global warming — is supposed to be a moment of resounding clarity, when world leaders come together to re-up their commitments to abandon fossil fuels and promote a future that’s, you know, livable.

The message should be clear: The world can and should abandon fossil fuels as quickly as possible in favor of cleaner energy sources like wind and solar.

We have the technology and the political levers we need to succeed.

Instead, the COP28 talks have been mired in controversy and confusion.

The United Arab Emirates, a petrostate, is hosting the talks. The COP president is Sultan Al Jaber, the head of a renewable energy company and also the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.

Appointing an oil exec to run global climate negotiations is not unlike letting the NRA facilitate a symposium on gun control.

No surprise, then, that Al Jaber made some, well, stupefying comments, including that abandoning fossil fuels — which, again, should be the point of these talks — risks putting us “back into caves.” He also claimed, falsely, that there is “no science” supporting a total phase-out of fossil fuels in order to meet temperature goals that are the center of the negotiations.

“Please, help me, show me a roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuels that will allow for sustainable socio-economic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves,” he said on November 21, in the days leading up to the COP28 summit. The remarks were part of a conversation with Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and UN special climate envoy, and were first reported by The Guardian, which posted a video of the discussion.

“There is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5C,” he said, referencing a temperature target from the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

A report issued Sunday during COP28 by the UN Environment Programme and others states that “a rapid and managed fossil fuel phase-out is required” to meet global climate goals.

Al Jaber tried to walk back the comments at a press conference on Monday, saying that he respects science and that the comments were subject to “misrepresentation.” “I have said over and over that the phase-down and the phase-out of fossil fuels is inevitable,” he said.

By then, however, the damage had been done.

Observers are right to question Al Jaber’s intentions and the intent of this entire process. And the public could understandably be confused about whether these efforts are even worthwhile.

That’s tragic, especially in light of the long and frustrating history of fossil fuel interests injecting doubt into policy conversations about the climate crisis. The broad strokes of climate science have been well understood for several decades now.

Starting in the 1970s, fossil fuel companies took a page from the tobacco industry’s playbook and started injecting doubt and confusion into well-settled science. John D. Sutter

But starting in the 1970s, fossil fuel companies took a page from the tobacco industry’s playbook and started injecting doubt and confusion into well-settled science. The fallout of that doubt still haunts political conversations about the climate crisis today. It leads to years and decades of stalled or flimsy action.

It’s also frustrating given that the public has few opportunities to focus on global warming — and the annual COP meeting tends to be one such moment when the world pays attention.

In the United States, only 35% of adults talk about the climate crisis at least occasionally, according to a 2021 survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

Slightly less — 33% — hear about it at least once a week in the media.

Not quite what you’d expect given that the habitability of our planet is in jeopardy. We are living with the consequences of a world we’ve warmed today — in the form of wildfires, extreme weather, searing drought and a burgeoning extinction crisis in the natural world.

If there’s a silver lining to the fact that Al Jaber’s comments have been wildly distracting, and disruptive, it’s that there is some benefit to plainly observing the predicament we are in.

Heat-trapping pollution from fossil fuels continues to go up year after year.

There are plenty of people and companies who profit from it.

Perhaps calling for Al Jaber to resign is part of a short-term solution to restore the credibility of COP28 and all the COP meetings still to come. But there’s a bigger point on which there must be absolute clarity in the public mind: We must demand a total phase-out of fossil fuels.

World leaders at COP28 can and should deliver on that promise.

And the public must hold them to account.","['expect', 'runs', 'climate', 'opinion', 'oil', 'fuels', 'phaseout', 'executive', 'science', 'world', 'fossil', 'cop28', 'talks', 'fuel', 'doubt', 'crisis']","CNN —As someone who’s been reporting on the climate crisis for more than a decade, I can say that the most insidious threat to climate action isn’t denial or apathy.

345,Opinion: Three rules for celebrities to avoid Julianna Margulies and Susan Sarandon moments,"Editor’s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN.

CNN —

Arguments are raging over whether Israel is adequately protecting civilian life in a war that has killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health and whether the world has adequately responded to a brutal terrorist attack in which Hamas, according to Israeli officials, killed more than 1,400 Israelis, raped women and kidnapped civilians.

Jill Filipovic Courtesy Jill Filipovic

Perhaps the last thing we need right now is that we’re grappling with controversy over what celebrities should or shouldn’t say, and how they should apologize when they inevitably botch commentary over complex world events.

Julianna Margulies, for example, has apologized for offensive comments she made on a podcast last month, in which she said she was disappointed that the Black and LGBTQ communities hadn’t come out in full-throated support of Jews in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks and the ongoing war in Gaza. “The fact that the entire Black community isn’t standing with us, to me, says either they just don’t know or they’ve been brainwashed to hate Jews,” she said.

She also said that, as an actress who played a lesbian on TV, she was offended by pro-Palestinian LGBTQ activists who “have no idea that if they stepped foot in an Islamic country” they “will be the first people beheaded and their heads played with… like a soccer ball on a field.”

Margulies apologized in an emailed statement to CNN on Friday, saying she is “horrified” that she “offended the Black and LGBTQIA+ communities, communities I truly love and respect.”

“I want to be 100% clear: Racism, homophobia, sexism, or any prejudice against anyone’s personal beliefs or identity are abhorrent to me, full stop,” she wrote. “Throughout my career I have worked tirelessly to combat hate of all kind, end antisemitism, speak out against terrorist groups like Hamas, and forge a united front against discrimination. I did not intend for my words to sow further division, for which I am sincerely apologetic.”

Somehow, though, Margulies’s comments aren’t the only offensive and bizarre celebrity commentary on Israel and Palestine. Last month, Susan Sarandon spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally and told the crowd, “There are a lot of people that are afraid, that are afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of how it feels to be Muslim in this country.” Sarandon issued an apology in a social media post last week saying the “phrasing” she chose “was a terrible mistake, as it implies that until recently Jews have been strangers to persecution, when the opposite is true.”

Anti-Semitic events have been a stubborn reality of life in the United States, from the defacement of synagogues to targeted assaults on Jews to a horrific mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018. By late October of this year, the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks anti-Semitic incidents in the United States, reported that the numbers were up by 400%.

Model Gigi Hadid posted a criticism of Israeli arrests and detentions of Palestinians, including children, but got so many of the facts wrong she eventually took it down and apologized for sharing “something that I did not fact check or deeply think about prior to reposting.” Several Hollywood figures who have opined about Israel or Palestine or both have seen swift professional consequences, from backlashes on social media to being dropped by their talent agencies.

Others have used more measured terms and mediated means to weigh in. In October, more than 700 celebrities and other Hollywood types signed onto an open letter condemning Hamas and urging the immediate return of Israeli hostages; that same month, hundreds of others signed onto an open letter urging President Joe Biden and Congress to “call for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza and Israel before another life is lost.”

Celebrities have said a lot about this war, some of them far too much. And yet some commentators are nevertheless incensed about the apparent celebrity “silence” on the war – by which they mean, of course, that not enough celebrities are speaking out in favor of their side.

It’s difficult to develop a hard-and-fast rule for celebrity political engagement. Most of us, I suspect, appreciate it when celebrities throw their influence behind the causes we care about, and are pretty disgusted when they publicly oppose the causes we support.

But we can expect a few things from people who are famous for their beauty or acting skills, not their mastery of international relations. First, we can ask that they speak when their conscience calls, not when the pressure to post calls.

Celebrities are human beings who are more knowledgeable and passionate about some issues than others, and also live under the microscope of fame. If they feel called to speak out on a particular issue, good for them. But if they feel insufficiently informed on it, or even scared of professional backlash, that’s ok too — whether Taylor Swift comments on the Israeli-Hamas war may shape the opinions of some Swifties and lend strength to one side of the social media battle but it is extremely unlikely to have any tangible effect on the conflict itself. (Swift has not made any statements on the issue. )

Second, we can also ask that when celebrities do post about politics or world events that they take extra care to make sure that they’re getting their facts right, and that they have at least a very basic understanding of what they’re discussing.

When celebrities post on social media, virality often follows, and their words can shape thousands of people’s perceptions and beliefs. They owe their followers a modicum of responsibility by fact-checking what they’re posting (or, even better, have staffers double and triple check).

And third, we can ask that when celebrities get it wrong, they apologize with sincerity, and reflect on what happened and why. And when that happens, the public can choose to offer them some grace.

Finally, it might be more helpful for all involved to take a step back and ask who it is we should actually be listening to and who we want to be speaking out. There are a great many people who are subject-matter experts and knowledgeable observers and human rights defenders and careful reporters, not to mention millions who are living the conflict as it happens. Most of them haven’t appeared on the big screen, starred in any reality TV shows, sold out Madison Square Garden, or walked in Fashion Week. But they’re the people whose voices we should be elevating in these grave and knotty moments.","['sarandon', 'moments', 'media', 'rules', 'opinion', 'celebrities', 'life', 'israel', 'theyre', 'post', 'jews', 'war', 'social', 'avoid', 'susan', 'ask', 'margulies', 'julianna']","First, we can ask that they speak when their conscience calls, not when the pressure to post calls.

CNN —

Was this real?

My nephew’s voice broke. Although he was calling me from Greece, I couldn’t tell if his words were coming from 5,000 miles away, from my ears, or from my own racing, panicked heart.

It took a few seconds for the reality of what he was saying to sink in; akin to when a dark nightmare we bury deep within suddenly finds voice in another’s words, leaving us utterly shaken.

My brother Majed. His wife Safaa. Their children Riman, 18, Siwar, 13, Ali, 7…

And nine-year-old Omar, whose dream was to be a soccer player.

All six of them, my family members.

Gone.

At 5.00 a.m. in the morning, two hours before the announced truce came into effect, an Israeli airstrike killed my loved ones, along with their favorite cat, “Lucky,” while they laid in bed. As they either slept or deluded themselves into thinking they were asleep, shrapnel tore through the door and the ceiling that had shielded them for the past 45 days in Gaza. The very walls that once promised safety now crushed and trapped their bodies beneath tons of rubble.

Only Omar’s body was found, 20 meters away from the blast site. After this “fortune” of being found, the aspiring soccer player was hurriedly laid to rest.

The remains of my other family members still lie unrecovered, while my 71-year-old mother mourns in a pile of rubble, grieving for her tender and loving child. She hopes to shield their bodies from the hungry, stray dogs that roam nearby, fearing they might desecrate the sanctity of her son, his wife, and their precious children.

Days earlier, I was the one to share the news about the death of our cousin with my family over the phone from the US, only to discover they hadn’t heard about it yet. They live just minutes away but have been cut off from the rest of humanity for weeks now. They mourn the departed, yet there have been so many loved ones lost, leaving very little time to properly grieve. In a way, this cheapens the value of human life, where death itself becomes tragically abundant.

While some celebrate the meager number of humanitarian trucks granted entry into Gaza during the recent pause in fighting, it’s crucial to be aware that not a single commercial truck has entered since October 7. Barred from Gaza for two months, shelves of supermarkets remain bare, severely impacting everyone from civilians to humanitarian organizations that are already stretched past thin.

Water is scarce, and food has become so rare that a can of tuna fish would be considered noteworthy, not to mention the tenfold surge in prices for basic items like yeast, salt and canned beans. Cash is useless, leaving people to stand in breadlines, stripped of their dignity.

This is a facet rarely discussed in Gaza – people don’t want handouts, those with money would buy the things they need if only they could find them. Everyone is forced to rely on assistance now and not all organizations can effectively deliver it.

Before I lost connection with my mom, I heard close gunfire and shelling. Mom mentioned the Israeli military destroyed scores of residential buildings around them including our neighborhood mosque, stealing their right to worship, a place to seek solace or pray for the deceased.

This news struck me deeply – I’m grappling with a crisis of faith witnessing a genocide unfold, while my mother living under bombs and burying her loved ones still clings to her spirituality.

When I first began to write this days ago, I was pondering the fate of Palestinians in Gaza, and how life might change if this ruthless and bloody genocide were to cease. Far too many good people have been senselessly killed.

I wondered: who will step into the shoes of those gifted doctors, caring nurses and compassionate medical staff lost in Gaza?

Who will carry on the work of the hardened and experienced war reporters and storytellers who were killed in Gaza?

Hani Almadhoun with his brother Majed, who was killed in Gaza last week. Hani Almadhoun

Can anyone ever replace the hundreds of educators, teachers, counselors, some of whom perished in the very schools turned shelters where they nurtured young minds?

And what about the thousands of students who won’t return to school and university because their lives and aspirations were cut short by a ruthless and senseless military campaign?

Who will take up the roles of the hundreds of engineers, makers and builders who lost their lives in the very buildings and streets they helped create?

And those coders, software engineers, techies, entrepreneurs, craftsmen, chefs – all gone, leaving behind memories and a trail of heartache.

Who will have the courage to dream of a future when the present is so uncertain?

Most importantly, I thought:

Who will fill the void left by the thousands of mothers and fathers who lost their lives due to the Israeli military destruction, leaving Gaza shattered and its people terrorized and scared as long as they live?

Again, I call on President Joe Biden to do everything in his power to stop the fighting and implement a permanent ceasefire, to stop the killing before other innocents in Gaza lose their lives.

These are irreplaceable individuals, not merely statistics or collateral damage but people cherished deeply by their loved ones.

In mere moments, they were tragically taken away forever.

I thought of those individuals deeply this week as I finally managed to speak to my family after two full weeks of no communication. There were numerous tears shed, unspoken words, and silences that seemed to scratch one’s soul.

Now, above all of these losses, I find that on the morning after Thanksgiving, at 5.00 a.m. in Gaza, the world lost a star soccer player. And all of these questions collapse on themselves.

Rest in peace, Omar.

You did nothing wrong. Your only crime was that you were born a Palestinian child.

CNN —

There’s a whole cottage industry in pop culture essay writing dedicated to trying to unpack why Taylor Swift is so successful. Is it because she’s the epitome of Americana? Or the ultimate vehicle for “millennial vibes”? Champion of the underdogs? The final girlboss?

Jeff Yang CNN

In fact, her popularity is anchored in the way she manages to be all of these things, and none of them for very long, pivoting effortlessly from persona to persona and position to position; shedding her skin when necessary (like the “snake” she was famously compared to by Kim Kardashian) to reveal fresh new colors beneath.

Constant reinvention is a given in pop iconhood, as countless prior and peer artists — from Michael Jackson and Madonna to Britney Spears and Justin Bieber — can attest. But no one else does it with the same casual, frictionless aplomb as Swift; her self-shifts don’t come off as acts of extravagant pick-me theater in the mode of Ariana Grande, or explosive artistic statements a la Beyoncé. Instead, they’re more like chord changes; variations in the key of Tay — eyebrow-raising, but never too extreme or off-putting. Which means that throughout all of her evolutions, she has remained accessible, approachable, personable and projectable; a cool hang for the guys, trusted bestie to the girls.

This careful balancing act has been a key reason why she’s stayed relevant across a career of nearly two decades. And it’s why she’ll undoubtedly reach the milestone of best-selling female solo artist of all time (at over 180 million albums sold according to ChartMasters.org, only Celine Dion at more than 220 million and Madonna at 250 million stand in her way).

The truth is, though, simply selling albums almost seems quaint now as a benchmark of Swiftian achievement. She’s now increasingly being spoken about as an economic force of nature, a transformative creator advocate, organizer and innovator and arguably the most influential — perhaps even the most powerful — figure in the music industry.

It was Swift who, in reaction to Scooter Braun acquiring the company controlling her early music masters, chose the almost unthinkable path of re-recording her old albums one by one, creating versions of her classic songs that are now under her direct control. The move isn’t just an act of revenge against someone whose actions she’s referred to publicly as “bullying.” It’s a rebel stroke that cuts at the heart of the recording industry’s power over creators, and one that was only possible because Swift is songwriter on all of her original music, and because of the uniquely equitable contract she signed with her current label, Republic Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. Under the terms of that contract, Swift demanded full ownership of all of her master recordings going forward, plus a royalty of at least 50%.

That said, it’s another clause in the agreement that demonstrates the full weight of Swift’s power: In an unprecedented move that seals her status as a kind of Joan of Arc for creator rights, she said she also got Universal, a major investor in Spotify, to agree that if it were to ever sell any of its shares, a non-recoupable split of those profits would be shared with Swift and all other fellow Universal recording artists.

Swift has used the occasion of her reinvention of her musical past to launch an extended global performance circuit, the “Eras” tour, which could become the most lucrative music tour in history. It will, all in, represent a $5.7 billion boost to the US economy according to the Washington Post, while injecting a profound degree of monetary stimulus into every city hosting her, given that her fans collectively spend around $93 million per show.

In Los Angeles, where she played six sold-out nights at SoFi Stadium, the tour generated enough money to support 3,300 jobs. And Swift generously showered her staff with spiffs, giving each of her tour truck drivers $100,000 in the summer, and providing other bonuses to her sound techs, backup dancers, catering crew and other staff, to the collective tune of $55 million. She can afford it. Already a billionaire, Swift stands to personally make as much as $4.1 billion from the “Eras” tour, according to estimates cited by the Post.

That doesn’t even include the money she stands to earn from the concert film she shot while on tour, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” which in yet another example of I’ll-do-it-myself disruption she paid for out of her own pocket as an independent production, eschbewing studio involvement, and subsequently distributed it via theater chain AMC. It has already earned more than $250 million at the box office, reportedly just under 60% of which will go straight to Swift’s production company, which will get another revenue bump when the film hits streaming platforms for rental and download on Dec. 13, Swift’s 34th birthday.

Many have pointed out that her outsized success has nepo baby roots — the daughter of a Merrill Lynch stockbroker, she grew up on an 11-acre Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania, and her dad helped to boost her early success by buying part of her original label, Big Machine Records. Swift would have had a much harder road in her path to stardom, which began when she moved to the country music mecca of Nashville, had she not been White, a privilege she herself has acknowledged in recent years.

Still, it’s Swift’s undeniable talent, her resourcefulness and her (blond) ambition that have gotten her where she is — that is to say, the very top. I admit to personally being a begrudging fan, not just of her music, but her incredible sense of enterprise. I take mental notes with every new move she makes — and if someone else doesn’t write a bestselling business tome detailing the lessons would-be moguls should learn from Swift’s savvy, I will.

348,Biden administration announces new financial strike force to curb deadly fentanyl trade,"Washington CNN —

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday announced a new Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force to crack down on the illicit financial networks supporting the cartels and drug traffickers that help funnel the drug into the United States.

The new strike force, part of the department’s efforts to tackle the deadly fentanyl trade, will streamline personnel and resources across the agency to better leverage its expertise in countering the financial crimes that back the networks supporting the fentanyl trade, according to the Treasury Department.

“The Treasury Department’s Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force will allow us to bring the Department’s unrivaled expertise in fighting financial crime to bear against this deadly epidemic. Treasury will use every tool at its disposal to disrupt the ability of drug traffickers to peddle this poison in our country,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement Monday.

The strike force will be led by the department’s top sanctions official, Brian Nelson, and the chief of the Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigations unit, James Lee. It will “redouble Treasury’s existing work streams, including using financial intelligence to understand risks and map transnational criminal organization (TCO) financial networks,” according to a news release.

Several key units within the Treasury Department that specialize in financial crimes, sanctions, and tracking terrorist and illicit financing will be part of the new strike force. These include: the IRS criminal investigation unit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes.

The new strike force’s key goals include combining analytic expertise across the Treasury Department to help identify opportunities to go after money laundering and fentanyl trafficking networks; strengthening coordination on investigating sanctions violations; and creating closer coordination when working with foreign partners on identifying international money laundering networks.

The new initiative comes after the US and China recently reached a deal on curbing fentanyl production, and as the US Treasury Department has taken an increasingly active role in addressing the threat posed by fentanyl.

“The Strike Force will act quickly and decisively with the top specialists from across the Department to nimbly respond to the newest threats,” Nelson, who has traveled to the US southern border at least twice this year, said in a statement.

Investigators from the Treasury Department can access and share powerful financial data with enforcement bodies such as the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Department of Homeland Security as they work to track and disrupt the fentanyl trade and drug suppliers. The new strike force will also help streamline the Treasury Department’s efforts to coordinate with local and federal law enforcement bodies on potential financial leads.

As part of his talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, President Joe Biden said that China agreed to go after the companies that produce the precursor chemicals to fentanyl.

And earlier this year, the Biden administration announced a broad effort to target the production and distribution of fentanyl, which included criminal charges from the Department of Justice and a host of new Treasury sanctions. The announcement built off an executive order signed in 2021 that expanded the Treasury Department’s authorities to target the distribution chains of fentanyl and other narcotics.

There has been a governmentwide push to curb synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, which are the main driver of overdose deaths in the US. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there has been a more than sevenfold increase in deaths from 2015 to 2021, and despite a recent slowing, overdose deaths still hover near record levels and remain the third-leading cause of death in adolescents ages 19 and younger.

The new strike force will not undermine the Treasury Department’s other sanctions regimes, including targeting Russia’s war machine amid its invasion of Ukraine, but rather will ensure the department is “most efficiently” deploying its “limited” resources, a senior Treasury official told CNN.

Yellen and Nelson will travel to Mexico this week for a series of meetings with their Mexican counterparts and private financial institutions to further discuss how the two countries can better target the illicit financial networks fueling the flow of synthetic opioids into the United States and deepen the bilateral economic relationship as the US looks to “friend-shore” supply chains, according to senior Treasury officials.

“Friend-shoring” is a Biden administration goal to strengthen US economic resilience by diversifying US supply chains with friendly countries.","['sanctions', 'department', 'departments', 'drug', 'financial', 'fentanyl', 'force', 'deadly', 'trade', 'announces', 'strike', 'biden', 'administration', 'networks', 'curb', 'treasury']","“The Treasury Department’s Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force will allow us to bring the Department’s unrivaled expertise in fighting financial crime to bear against this deadly epidemic.

349,"Sen. Murphy open to placing conditions on aid to Israel, calls civilian death toll in Gaza ‘unacceptable’","CNN —

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy on Sunday said he was open to placing conditions on any aid to Israel, with the aim of reducing civilian casualties in Gaza.

The Connecticut Democrat, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” that as lawmakers return to the Capitol Monday with the elusive goal of passing aid to Israel and Ukraine, they will discuss how to structure aid to Israel so it is used in line with human rights laws. His comments, on the third day of the truce between Israel and Hamas, come as other lawmakers — on both sides of the aisle — either didn’t rule out the idea of conditions on aid or underscored concern about minimizing civilian Palestinian casualties.

“We regularly condition our aid to allies based upon compliance with US law and international law. And, so, I think it’s very consistent with the ways in which we have dispensed aid, especially during wartime, to allies, for us to talk about making sure that the aid we give Ukraine or the aid we give Israel is used in accordance with human rights laws,” Murphy said. “And that’ll be a conversation we will all be engaged in when we get back to Washington on Monday.”

Murphy has previously called on Israel to try to further reduce civilian casualties and to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, where more than 14,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry there, in the wake of Hamas’ brutal cross-border assault on Israel on October 7.

“I do believe that the level of civilian harm inside Gaza has been unacceptable and is unsustainable,” he said. “I think there’s both a moral cost to this many civilians, innocent civilians, children often, losing their life, but I think there’s (also) a strategic cost. Ultimately, Hamas will get stronger, not weaker, in the long run if all of this civilian death allows them to recruit more effectively and ably inside Gaza.”

But Murphy also said that Israel has a “moral obligation” to continue fighting Hamas following the temporary four-day truce between Hamas and Israel, which is now in its third day.

“Hopefully, Hamas will accept the conditions that have been laid down that will allow for more hostages to be released. But if they don’t, ultimately Hamas is going to be defeated,” added Murphy. “That’s in Israel’s interest, but it’s also in the interest of the United States. We do not want terrorist organizations believing they can get away with the kind of murder that Hamas did on October 7.”

The Biden administration has pleaded with lawmakers to come together to pass aid for Ukraine and Israel, but disputes over supporting Ukraine — and now over immigration policy — have marred the talks.

Some progressives have proposed adding strict restrictions on aid, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who released an extensive list of proposed demands for the Israeli government to receive US aid, including “an end to the indiscriminate bombing,” a “right of displaced Gazans to return to their homes,” “a freeze on settlement expansion” in the West Bank and no long-term occupation of Gaza by Israeli forces, as well as a commitment to engage in peace talks “for a two-state solution in the wake of the war.”

Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet indicated to CBS in an interview Sunday that he is open to supporting conditions on aid to Israel. “I haven’t so far, but I think that’s a debate we’re going to have in the coming days,” the Colorado senator, who services on the Intelligence Committee, said on “Face the Nation.”

House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, told NBC Sunday that while he wouldn’t propose placing conditions on aid to Israel aimed at lessening civilian casualties in Gaza, it is already the policy of the US and Israel.

“I think the White House has been clear, and I think US policy has been clear, of lessening the Palestinian casualties that are not Hamas,” Turner said on “Meet the Press,” adding that Israel has issued warnings to civilians about which areas will be targeted. “I wouldn’t propose it, but I think it does accurately reflect US policy.”

Murphy on Sunday also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s previous policies toward Palestinians, saying, “Benjamin Netanyahu believed that you could ignore the Palestinians, that you could try to squash their desires for a state and, ultimately, that would bring peace to the region into Israel. That’s just not the case.”

He continued, “Ultimately, the next government is going to have to put us back on a path to have a Palestinian state. That’s not easy, but it is the only way forward for Israel, is the only way forward for long-term peace.”

350,"Florida GOP chair defies DeSantis, won’t step down as new details of sexual assault allegation emerge","CNN —

The head of Florida’s Republican Party indicated Saturday he will not step down while facing an investigation into sexual assault, rejecting calls by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to give up his role as the party’s top operative.

In a letter to the state GOP, chairman Christian Ziegler did not address the allegation – which continued to send shockwaves through the state on Saturday as troubling new details about the investigation emerged – but suggested a conspiracy was afoot to leak details from the Sarasota Police Department probe.

“We have a country to save and I am not going to let false allegations of a crime put that mission on the bench as I wait for this process to wrap up,” he wrote.

According to a search warrant affidavit, which CNN obtained from the Florida Center for Government Accountability, Ziegler and his wife Bridget planned a three-way sexual encounter with the alleged victim on the day of the alleged assault on October 2, and “when the victim learned that Bridget could not make it, she changed her mind and canceled with Christian.”

Surveillance video showed Ziegler arriving at the alleged victim’s residence on the day of the alleged assault, the affidavit says. The alleged victim told investigators she “opened her apartment door to walk her dog and Christian was standing outside in the hallway.” The alleged victim said Christian entered the apartment and raped her on a bar stool, according to the affidavit.

“The victim advised Christian did not wear a condom,” the affidavit said. The alleged victim said she told Christian “she was not in a place to consent” because “she had been drinking tequila all day.”

The alleged victim later called her sister and told her she had been raped, the affidavit states, noting that police interviewed the alleged victim’s sister and confirmed the details of the phone call.

Police then interviewed Bridget Ziegler, according to the affidavit. She told detectives she knew the alleged victim through her husband and confirmed having a sexual encounter with the alleged victim and her husband “over a year ago and that it only happened one time.”

On November 2, detectives interviewed Ziegler with his attorney present, the affidavit states. Ziegler admitted to having sex with the alleged victim, but said the sex was consensual and that he recorded the encounter. “Christian said he initially deleted the video, but since the allegation, he uploaded the video to his Google Drive which we have not been able to locate upon a digital extraction.”

During the investigation, police said Ziegler tried to contact the alleged victim via Instagram. The alleged victim then began communicating with Ziegler with the help of detectives, according to the affidavit. In one alleged exchange on October 27, the alleged victim wrote: “I’m not okay with what happened the other day between us”.

“Oh. That’s not good. You are my friend. Known ya for like twenty years now. Lol,” Ziegler replied.

“Yeah I know but that was not cool and you didn’t bring her [Bridget] and then did that to me,” the alleged victim responded.

“She was in. Then couldn’t because no response. She said in next time,” Ziegler replied.

Several phone calls between the alleged victim and Ziegler were audio recorded, according to the affidavit. In one call, the alleged victim allegedly told Ziegler “he sexually assault her” and Ziegler replied, “Those are big words, please don’t, no I didn’t. You invited me in, that’s it. I did not at all, and I never want you to feel that way.”

CNN has made multiple attempts to contact the Zieglers. In a statement Friday, Christian Ziegler’s attorney Derek Byrd said: “We are confident that once the police investigation is concluded that no charges will be filed and Mr. Ziegler will be completely exonerated.”

“Unfortunately, public figures are often accused of acts that they did not commit whether it be for political purposes or financial gain. I would caution anyone to rush to judgment until the investigation is concluded,” Byrd said.

The allegations have not only raised questions about Christian Ziegler’s capacity to lead the party into the 2024 election season but have drawn acute criticism because of the role the Zieglers have played in helping to execute a crackdown on LGBTQ materials in Florida schools under DeSantis.

Bridget Ziegler, 41, a thrice-elected Sarasota County school board member, co-founded Moms for Liberty, a conservative parents’ rights organization that has led the efforts in Florida and beyond to remove books from classrooms they deem inappropriate for kids. She has also served as a close ally of DeSantis in his crackdown on removing sexual orientation and gender identity from schools. She helped author the Parents Bill of Rights in Florida, a law DeSantis signed in 2021 in response to concerns from conservative parents that schools were withholding information about children expressing a change in sexual orientation and gender identity.

This year, DeSantis named Bridget Ziegler to the board that now oversees the Walt Disney Company’s special taxing district in Central Florida amid his clash with the entertainment giant over a state law that restricted how sexual orientation and gender identity could be taught in the classroom.

Christian Ziegler, 40, has also fiercely defended DeSantis’ agenda against national backlash from LGTBQ groups. In an interview with the Washington Examiner, he said Democrats who opposed DeSantis were “perverted” and encouraged them to leave the state.

In his letter to the state GOP, Ziegler suggested that the information made public about the investigation was intentionally leaked because he and his wife are “such loud political voices.” He said the complaint and investigation should have remained confidential until the conclusion of the investigation, and that he could not publicly share his side of the story at this point in the process.

The letter came a day after DeSantis said Ziegler should step down as party chairman, telling reporters “I don’t see how we can continue with that investigation ongoing, given the gravity of those situations.”

“I think he should step aside,” DeSantis said. “I think he should tend to that.”

“I’ve known him. I’ve known Bridget. They’ve been friends, but the mission is more important,” he added.

Ziegler, though, outlined a timeline to remain in power. He told the party that his “role in the investigation is complete” and he anticipated a conclusion to the probe.

“When we reach that point, I will have a lot more to share about the facts, how this transpired, the motive and who was behind it,” he said.","['florida', 'investigation', 'emerge', 'ziegler', 'alleged', 'gop', 'victim', 'affidavit', 'step', 'desantis', 'defies', 'chair', 'told', 'christian', 'details', 'sexual', 'wont']","Ziegler admitted to having sex with the alleged victim, but said the sex was consensual and that he recorded the encounter.

351,Sen. Graham says he has ‘lost all confidence’ in Defense Sec. Lloyd Austin,"CNN —

GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham on Sunday called Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin “naive” for believing further civilian casualties in Gaza could produce even more insurgents and said he has “lost all confidence” in him.

“He’s so naive, I mean I just lost all confidence in this guy,” Graham told CNN’s Dana Bash, adding later, “This is a radicalized population. I don’t want to kill innocent people, but Israel is fighting not just Hamas, but the infrastructure around Hamas.”

Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum Saturday, Austin said he has “personally pushed Israeli leaders to avoid civilian casualties, and to shun irresponsible rhetoric, and to prevent violence by settlers in the West Bank, and to dramatically expand access to humanitarian aid.”

“You see, in this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat,” Austin said.

Graham, on “State of the Union,” disagreed: “Strategic defeat would be inflaming the Palestinians? They’re already inflamed. They are taught from the time they’re born to hate the Jews and to kill them.”

The South Carolina Republican said the retired Army general and former commander of US Central Command “is telling Israel things that are impossible to achieve” and called on Austin to “quit criticizing Israel in public.”

“Secretary Austin, the reason Palestinians are dying: Gaza is so condensed, Hamas has tunnels under apartments, under schools, under hospitals,” Graham said.

Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed at least 15,207 people and injured at least 40,652 others, Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza, saidSaturday.

He added that he understands the theory of what retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal has called “insurgent math,” an idea that collateral civilian death in warfare can be a catalyst for creating insurgents, but argued Gaza’s population “has been radicalized for decades.”

“If we were attacked like this, which we were in 9/11, if somebody called for us within two months to have a ceasefire against al-Qaeda, we would’ve laughed them out of town,” he said.

Graham also criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, who on Saturday during a news conference in Dubai said that “too many innocent Palestinians have been killed” as she met with the leaders of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan during her trip to the COP28 climate summit.

Graham questioned, “What is too many people dying in World War II after Pearl Harbor?”

“Vice President Harris, tell Israel how to destroy Hamas in a way not to hurt innocent Palestinians, and I’ll pass it along,” he said.

“No Republican believes this, by the way,” he added. “No Republican is telling Israel to change your military tactics.”","['civilian', 'sen', 'lloyd', 'austin', 'hamas', 'palestinians', 'graham', 'israel', 'sec', 'population', 'defense', 'confidence', 'republican', 'called', 'gaza', 'innocent', 'lost']","CNN —GOP Sen.

352,Johnson moves to corral GOP hardliners as tension grows in ranks,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had a bone to pick with the new speaker.

Ahead of the Thanksgiving recess, the Georgia Republican was frustrated that GOP lawmakers helped defeat her effort to force a vote on impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. And Greene – who has publicly insulted her Republican colleagues over their opposition to impeachment – also told CNN she was concerned about a “very serious situation” she experienced with an unnamed “male Republican of the conference,” declining to go into further details.

Normally, she would march straight into former Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s office, where she often got swift results. But Greene said she had a tougher time connecting with Speaker Mike Johnson, who doesn’t have a strong relationship with the congresswoman. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, was supposed to call her before the holiday break to listen to her concerns, according to Greene, but never did.

“I haven’t heard much from him,” Greene told CNN earlier this week.

The pair ultimately connected on Thursday ahead of another divisive vote she was planning to force on removing Mayorkas. Greene said Johnson heard her out and gave her assurances that her impeachment articles would move through committee and on to the floor. Greene then opted to pull her Mayorkas impeachment resolution – at least for now.

The episode involving Greene, the full details of which have not been previously reported, illustrates how Johnson is still learning how to wrangle the hardliners in his conference – a crucial skill for governing over a rambunctious and razor-thin majority that just got even smaller after the expulsion of indicted former Rep. George Santos. Taking a page from his predecessor’s playbook, Johnson has tried to dole out commitments and face-time to some of his potential critics. But so far, the speaker’s strategy has had mixed results.

After GOP Rep. Max Miller gave a searing public rebuke of Johnson’s recent decision-making on an Israel aid package, the speaker tried to arrange a sit-down meeting with the freshman lawmaker, presumably to smooth things over, according to sources familiar with the situation.

The Ohio Republican, however, has rebuffed Johnson’s entreaties, telling CNN he is “very upset.”

“I have chosen not to talk to him at this moment in time. He’s got his hands full with other things and until he can show me that he can lead I’m not going to waste my time sitting down with him,” Miller said.

Asked to give Johnson a grade on his performance, he said he’d give him a “D-minus. I’ve lost a lot of faith so far.”

And then there’s Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus who has continued to create headaches for Republican leaders with his outspoken criticism, questioning what his own party has accomplished since taking the majority.

When asked how Johnson has tried to handle the situation, Roy told CNN: “We’re still having conversations. The question here is what’s going to end up being delivered, but you know, we’ll see.”

But in other instances, Johnson has had success in taming some of the party’s loudest rebels – a sign that the speaker, who himself hails from the conservative wing of the party, has the ability to make inroads where McCarthy could not.

GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida – who led the charge to oust McCarthy as speaker – was among those personally pushing Johnson to sign off on subpoenas for Hunter and James Biden and publicly release the footage from the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, according to sources familiar with the situation. Those early moves from Johnson earned swift applause from Gaetz and the right flank.

And GOP Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, signaled this week they would no longer demand the $1.47 trillion topline spending number the caucus had been seeking all summer, saying they’d be amenable to the $1.59 trillion number agreed to in the bipartisan debt limit deal that enraged conservatives and helped lead to McCarthy’s ouster. The group even held the House hostage for days until McCarthy agreed to back off the deal he cut with the White House to seek even deeper cuts, a decision that has led to the current impasse over government spending on Capitol Hill.

“Certainly some members of the Freedom Caucus allowed their hatred of Kevin McCarthy to cloud their judgment and that misjudgment on their part weakened the Republican Conference and as a result made it harder for us to deliver conservative wins,” said Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican. “So, yes, that McCarthy derangement was real.”

Veteran GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma acknowledged, “It’s a challenge around here, no matter who the speaker is.”

“There is a lot of different personalities. We have a lot of different groups and points of view in the conference,” he told CNN. “But I’m very pleased with how well he is handling it.”

Internal feuds on full display

One of Johnson’s chief challenges has been dealing with the feuds in his bitterly divided party, where members have been in open warfare with one another in the wake of McCarthy’s unprecedented ouster.

Greene has been among the most difficult for Johnson on that front, openly bashing her Republican colleagues and using procedural tools to force a series of floor votes on divisive issues – tactics that have rubbed her colleagues the wrong way and put her increasingly on an island inside the GOP.

“It’s not right. She’s not a team player,” Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican who represents a district in Nebraska won by President Joe Biden in 2020, told CNN. “It’s all about individual stuff. We have a speaker, a chairman, for a reason. We should respect their word.”

After her failed attempt to force a vote on impeaching Mayorkas, Greene lashed out at GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California on social media, using emojis to question his manhood for siding with Democrats to defeat the effort.

In an interview, Issa would not say if her tactics are helpful. “That’s really a question for the speaker. It’s a question for the majority leader. It’s a question for the whip.”

Asked if he would consider her a productive member, Issa smiled and said: “Well, she does do a lot.”

And Greene also criticized GOP Rep. Tom McClintock of California, who delivered a floor speech this week railing against Greene for being “reckless” and “shooting from the hip” with her tactics on impeachment.

“I would urge my colleagues not to undermine a legitimate impeachment inquiry with hyper partisan, hysterical bombast,” McClintock told CNN.

Greene, who was booted from the Freedom Caucus earlier this year for being too cozy with McCarthy, also repeatedly attacked Roy for opposing her resolution to censure Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib for attending an pro-Palestinian protest, which Greene referred to in her resolution as an “insurrection.”

But Greene – who McCarthy brought into the fold in an attempt to keep the congresswoman’s behavior in check – said she has no regrets about her feuds with her colleagues, a sign she has little intention of backing down.

“I’ll remind everyone that I didn’t come here to make friends,” Greene said. She said that any Republicans who are “upset could talk to me anytime they’d like.”

“My position will be that we need to be doing the jobs that we promised to our voters … instead of just talking tough on the campaign trail and then coming up here and falling apart,” Greene told CNN.

Meanwhile, there’s also some unhappiness with Johnson and the leadership team for voting against expelling Santos, even though GOP leaders did not whip the vote and encouraged members to vote their conscience.

“This is just another example of Republicans who can’t lead. And that’s really shameful,” Miller said. “The speaker and everyone in leadership knows that this man is a crook.”

Hardliners could still create headaches on spending

While the far right has signaled it is willing to soften some of their spending demands, funding will still be a sticky issue for Johnson in the months ahead.

The House GOP convened a conference meeting on Thursday morning, which has not been previously reported, to hash out their plans for upcoming spending issues – including how to handle a White House push for an Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and border security package.

GOP Rep. Bob Good of Virginia said the Freedom Caucus made clear to the speaker on Thursday what their expectations are. That includes keeping aid for Israel and Ukraine separated, a plan to cut spending and secure the border, and a commitment not to attach a reauthorization of a controversial surveillance program to the annual defense bill.

“It’s been an effective effort – in conference this morning, and in subsequent meetings that took place after conference – to let leadership know what to put some red lines on,” Good told CNN.

Roy, meanwhile, expressed his frustrations during the closed-door conference meeting, according to attendees.

“I think everyone’s on edge right now, frustration levels are higher,” California Rep. Mike Garcia said after the meeting on Thursday. “So we need to come together as a team regardless of how frustrated we are.”

Before Thanksgiving, Roy gave an impassioned speech on the House floor where he demanded his GOP colleagues give him “one thing” Republicans have done since reclaiming the House majority – comments that infuriated Republican lawmakers and gave instant ammunition to Democrats.

This week, Roy doubled down on his position, and organized a “power hour” of speeches on the House floor to continue airing his grievances. But he also made clear his beef is not personal.

“Mike is one of the finest human beings I know. He’s a good man, he’s a conservative.” Roy told CNN. “Look, whoever is in the seat has got to figure out how to manage all of this. That’s the job. So, he’ll figure it out.”","['ranks', 'mccarthy', 'speaker', 'rep', 'gop', 'corral', 'tension', 'hardliners', 'republican', 'moves', 'greene', 'told', 'johnson', 'house', 'conference', 'grows']","But Greene said she had a tougher time connecting with Speaker Mike Johnson, who doesn’t have a strong relationship with the congresswoman.

353,Shoes and germs: Should you ask your party guests to go barefoot?,"Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.

CNN —

At-home holiday parties are on many people’s calendars right now, and germ-conscious hosts are faced with a dilemma: Should I require my guests to take off their shoes at the door, especially if the gathering is cocktail or formal attire — or the guest is a stylish shoeaholic like Carrie Bradshaw?

In a 2003 “Sex and the City” episode, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is asked to leave her $485 Manolo Blahnik shoes at the door during a New York City baby shower hosted by her friend Kyra (Tatum O’Neal) and soon finds they have been stolen.

“I hadn’t even done a full lap around the party,” Carrie lamented later at a lunch with her friends. The iconic TV character had been forced to walk home in her party dress and old gray sneakers lent by her host.

“Why in the h*ll did you take off your shoes to begin with?” asked Carrie’s friend Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall).

“We had to!” Carrie explained. “For their kids — apparently we drag things in on our heels that make children sick.”

While the episode, “A Woman’s Right to Shoes,” was designed to discuss dilemmas facing single people in a world focused on families with children, the underlying question — and debate — around footwear and health remains: Is there significant evidence going shoeless stops the spread of germs in a home?

“Absolutely,” said Gabriel Filippelli, chancellor’s professor for the department of Earth sciences at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and executive director of Indiana University’s Environmental Resilience Institute.

“We can track in all sorts of bacteria, but certainly some of the ones we’re most concerned about are E. coli that cause severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting,” he said. “There’s been studies that swab the bottom of shoes and something like 99% of the shoes test positive for fecal material.”

Heavy metals and more

However, bacteria are not the only danger that rides along with the dust and dirt surrounding rural and urban homes, gardens and parks, said Jill Litt, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado in Boulder who is currently working as a senior researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, or ISGlobal, in Spain.

“Studies have shown that in urban areas where there are older homes, lead in dust can be tracked into the home on the surface of shoes,” she said. “Other studies have shown that you can bring in pesticide residues from gardens via shoes.”

Heavy metals like lead and copper and zinc permeate the soils of urban parks and streets from decades of pollutants, while pesticide levels can be high in rural agricultural areas, Litt added.

Homes built before 1978 are very likely to contain lead-based paint, which can chip, peel and disintegrate into dangerous dust, experts say. There is no safe level of lead at any age, but children are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of heavy metals and pesticides due to their small size and proximity to contaminants as they crawl, roll and play on the floors of the home.

“For little ones, hand to mouth is one of the primary ways children get exposed to toxic substances and infectious disease agents,” said Litt, who is also a leader of Reimagining Environments for Connection and Engagement: Testing Actions for Social Prescribing in Natural Spaces. Funded by the European Union, the project aims to fight loneliness with natural spaces.

Wet mop first

Before you ask folks to take off their shoes, be sure the home is as dust-free as possible, experts say. Never vacuum or sweep with a broom first, as that will only stir up all the toxins, sending them airborne. Instead, reach for the wet or spray mop. As counterintuitive as it may be to add water to dirt, it’s actually the best way to remove toxins, Litt said.

The same goes for any horizontal surface, Filippelli said, but stay away from feather dusters. “Do more regular cleaning of horizontal surfaces with a damp cloth — that’s windowsills, tables, coffee tables, chair bottoms, chair seats and other furniture in addition to the floor.”

Use the “three-bucket” method if you live in an older home with lead paint or an area with high levels of lead outside. Have one bucket ready with an all-purpose cleaning solution, another to rinse and an empty bucket.

“Some folks also use a very weak vinegar solution in their wash water, which works really well,” Filippelli said. “There are some super sterilizers on the market, but when cleaners are really good at killing bacteria, they’re usually not very good for us as human beings. Whenever you can smell a superstrong smell from something, you got to at least think twice about it.”

Dip your mop into the cleaning solution, squeeze the excess water into the empty bucket, and begin to mop, starting from the farthest point from the door. Work toward the door, using the clean water as a rinse as you go. Flush water into the toilet when it looks dirty or with each new room — don’t throw it outside.

“The highest concentration of germs is in the interior entry way and levels go down as you move greater distances from this area,” Litt said. “Carpeting retains a lot of dust so that would be one thing I would remove if you had concerns about dusts and potential health concerns.”

354,‘The Brick’ is at the center of our galaxy. An unexpected new finding may help unlock its mysteries,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

A box-shaped cloud of opaque dust that lies at the center of our galaxy has long perplexed scientists, and observations that reveal a new detail about its composition are deepening the mystery — possibly upending what’s known about how stars form.

The cloud, nicknamed “the Brick” for its visual impenetrability and rectangular appearance, was previously estimated to hold more than 100,000 times the mass of the sun. And such a dense blob should be churning out massive new stars, based on researchers’ current understanding of star formation.

But it’s not.

The Brick is largely dormant. And the latest observations, made using the James Webb Space Telescope, did not reveal any hidden, young stars.

The new Webb data instead unveiled that the Brick is not just made up of gas. It’s also littered with frozen carbon monoxide — much more than previously expected — according to a study published Monday in The Astrophysical Journal. And there’s more ice forming deeper into the Brick.

The findings could have drastic implications for how scientists analyze this region going forward. More carbon monoxide ice inside the Brick could dramatically change how researchers study and measure dark clouds in the center of the Milky Way.

“We are (now) closer to understanding what exactly is happening in the Brick and where the mass is,” said University of Florida astronomer Adam Ginsburg, lead author of the study. “But we opened more questions than we closed with this.”

Among those questions: Why and where is this carbon monoxide freezing into ice?

Other mysteries that loom for this region remain unanswered as well: Why can’t we see any new stars forming? Is the Brick not as dense as scientists once believed? And what are the strange ridge- and filament-like features that show up within the Brick?

“We have more to investigate before we can really be sure what’s going on,” Ginsburg said. “I would say we’re in the hypothesis-forming phase, not the drawing conclusions phase.”

What Webb revealed

Ginsburg and his fellow researchers, which included University of Florida graduate students, first got their hands on this new Webb data in September 2022.

It was a crucial moment. As the most powerful space telescope ever constructed, Webb could offer never-before-seen insights into the Brick. But right off the bat, Ginsburg and his team found the data needed a lot of work. The Webb telescope orients itself using a map, determining which direction it’s pointing by referencing where it is in relation to known stars.

The trouble was, “there’s so many stars at the galactic center that it gets confused,” Ginsburg said. So, researchers had to spend months cleaning up the data, orienting it to line up correctly with the existing maps of the sky.

Then, as they peered at the Brick, they found that the images from Webb were turning out the wrong color.

“All the stars were coming out a bit too blue,” Ginsburg said, prompting researchers to wonder if something was wrong with the data.

But it turned out, he said, the problem was with their assumptions. The scientists hadn’t expected there to be so much carbon monoxide ice — and that was the cause of the color change, according to the study.

Learning of the existence of the ice could have broad ripple effects for all kinds of research into the center of the Milky Way, said Dr. Natalie Butterfield, an assistant scientist at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, who was not involved in the study.

Butterfield said her own research — which includes studying supernovae and the radiation between star systems — could be forever altered by understanding the existence of this carbon monoxide ice. It could change how scientists estimate the mass of all the clouds in the galactic center.

Why carbon monoxide matters

There are several perplexing things about all this carbon monoxide ice. For instance, the area is fairly warm — around 60 Kelvin (minus 351.67 degrees Fahrenheit) — while carbon monoxide typically freezes at 20 Kelvin.

It could be that the dust inside the Brick is much colder than the gas, causing the carbon monoxide around the dust particles to turn solid. Or, Ginsburg said, it could be that water is freezing, trapping carbon monoxide inside.

The answer matters.

All the ice in a region such as the Brick can give scientists new insight into our solar system — even our home planet.

The ice and water that exist on Earth, for example, likely arrived here via comets. So, where ice exists in the universe and how it forms can help researchers understand where these comets come from and how they collected the materials they deposited.

Where are the stars?

And then there is the big mystery of why there is a lack of star formation within the Brick.

Scientists already know that new stars are brewed from dust clouds and hydrogen molecules. But scientists cannot directly observe hydrogen molecules within the Brick — or anywhere else in the universe — because they’re invisible to telescopes.

However, scientists also know that for every hydrogen molecule, there’s likely a certain amount of carbon monoxide. And carbon monoxide is visible — so scientists can measure it as a proxy for identifying how many hydrogen molecules are in a given area.

Researchers have been using this method for measuring hydrogen molecules for 50 years, Ginsburg said.

But they’ve always assumed the carbon monoxide was gas — not solid ice, as the Webb data revealed. This finding opens a whole new can of worms, Ginsburg said.

Ginsburg noted that it’s crucial for researchers to understand what state of matter the carbon monoxide is in — gas or solid — to arrive at the right answers.

Every new piece of knowledge about the Brick and its makeup better informs why this opaque cloud isn’t producing stars, even though — by most accounts — it should be one of the most active star nurseries in the galaxy.

“It’s a really natural place for new stars,” Ginsburg said. “But we haven’t found very many — only a very, very tiny handful.”

There are some possible answers that Ginsburg and other researchers are anxious to explore: Perhaps the Brick is more spread out — less compact — than scientists once thought. Or maybe it’s just too young, and its star-forming days are ahead.

Those are questions, Ginsburg and Butterfield said, that Webb can continue to help researchers answer.

“It’s just an impressive, impressive telescope,” Butterfield said. “I think this is just the first of many unique results that will be coming out of the JWST for the galactic center.”","['galaxy', 'mysteries', 'center', 'webb', 'carbon', 'unlock', 'unexpected', 'researchers', 'stars', 'monoxide', 'ice', 'brick', 'telescope', 'scientists', 'ginsburg', 'help', 'finding']","It’s also littered with frozen carbon monoxide — much more than previously expected — according to a study published Monday in The Astrophysical Journal.

355,Scientists reveal new insights into mysterious baboon mummies of ancient Egypt,"CNN —

To date, tens of millions of animal mummies have been unearthed in Egypt. But while there are millions of mummified cats, dogs, ibises and birds of prey, primate mummies are rare — and little understood.

Now, new analysis of mummified baboons is shedding light on the animals’ place in ancient Egypt, revealing that, while they were prized as sacred animals, their living conditions were less than ideal.

Researchers analyzed bones from mummified baboons, which were discovered in the early 1900s in the necropolis Gabbanat el-Qurud, in the so-called Valley of the Monkeys, to the southwest of Egypt’s Valley of the Kings. The bones represented dozens of individual baboons — from infants to adults — in two species: the hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas) and the olive baboon (Papio anubis).

These species weren’t native to Egypt — they were imported from two regions: “the olive baboon from the south (present-day Sudan), and the hamadryas baboon from mountainous areas bordering the Red Sea, in Sudan and southwards to Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia,” said lead study author Wim Van Neer, a professor emeritus at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels. “The exact provenances still need to be documented in more detail,” Van Neer told CNN in an email.

Of all the animals that the ancient Egyptians venerated, baboons were the only ones not native to Egypt, Van Neer added.

The baboons are thought to have played a role in ancient Egyptian rituals, the scientists reported Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. But raising and caring for large wild animals — particularly non-native species — is challenging. Before their deaths the baboons were sunlight-deprived and developed bone ailments from poor nutrition, researchers discovered. Examination of the skeletal remains revealed signs of rickets; the baboons had deformed arms, legs and faces, undeveloped teeth, osteoarthritis and other pathologies due to deprivation and metabolic disease.

Their deformities resembled those seen in the bones of baboons from two other ancient Egyptian sites — Saqqara and Tuna el-Gebel — dating to around the same period, the authors wrote.

“This excellently crafted and executed study confirms the results of some earlier investigations concerning the health status of baboons in ancient Egypt,” said Dr. Salima Ikram, a Distinguished University Professor of Egyptology from the American University of Cairo, who was not involved in the research. “More importantly, it also establishes the fact that different types of baboons were being brought to and reared in Egypt,” Ikram told CNN in an email. “It is fascinating to think that the ancient Egyptians tried to institute a breeding programme for baboons so that they could both be revered as well as used in religious rituals.”

A jumble of bones

At the three main Egyptian sites where mummies of Old World monkeys were interred, 463 mummified primates have been discovered, according to the study. The baboon bones examined for the new analysis were collected in 1905 and 1906 by archaeologists from the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle de Lyon in France (now the Musée des Confluences).

In the tombs were pieces of dried skin with long tufts of hair still attached, suggesting that the animals had been placed there as mummies. The French archaeologists recovered 23 skulls, 24 mandibles and more than 200 isolated bones, which were assembled into complete skeletons regardless of whether all the bones belonged to the same baboon, according to the study.

Two skeletons had been cobbled together from bones belonging to two different baboons, and one skeleton represented three of the primates. Of the four skeletons that were properly put together, only one had the correct skull. After analyzing the bones one by one, the study authors identified 36 different baboons of all ages, a set with more adults than juveniles and a few more males than females.

The bones also revealed signs of metabolic problems during adolescent growth, including curved shafts, misshapen shaft heads and arthritic joints. Two female baboons had suffered from tooth decay. There were lesions in some of the skulls; two of the primates had shortened snouts, and two others had snouts that bent to the left.

The mummies were also centuries older than previously thought. Based on the mummies’ proximity to nearby ceramic artifacts in the tombs, earlier estimates placed them between the first and second centuries at the earliest, and possibly as recent as the seventh century.

But when the study authors examined bone collagen and fibers from a textile that had been wrapped around an intact baboon mummy, they found that the animals were likely entombed between 803 and 520 BC. The researchers confirmed that time frame using a technique called radiocarbon dating, which can determine the age of organic material by measuring the amount of decay in a radioactive isotope of carbon.

Sacred and suffering

Conditions for the captive primates may have been even worse than their remains suggested, as bones often don’t preserve records of parasites and other types of ailments, the researchers reported.

However, it’s important to note the scientists’ findings don’t suggest that the baboons were being intentionally abused. Their keepers likely did the best that they could to care for the animals, “but this must not have been easy,” Van Neer said.

“Baboons are good climbers and they were therefore probably kept in buildings or enclosures with high walls to prevent them from escaping. Because of the lack of sunlight they developed the metabolic disorders that we see, mainly rickets. There are no signs of broken bones that would suggest the animals were ill-treated physically,” he said.

“Unfortunately, the Egyptians did not know enough about the care and feeding of baboons,” Ikram added. “While trying to give them reverence and care they actually established conditions detrimental to the health and well-being of the animals — the way to hell is paved with good intentions!”

356,Superbug crisis: How a woman saved her husband's life,"CNN —

In February 2016, infectious disease epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee was holding her dying husband’s hand, watching him lose an exhausting fight against a deadly superbug infection.

After months of ups and downs, doctors had just told her that her husband, Tom Patterson, was too racked with bacteria to live.

“I told him, ‘Honey, we’re running out of time. I need to know if you want to live. I don’t even know if you can hear me, but if you can hear me and you want to live, please squeeze my hand.’

“All of a sudden, he squeezed really hard. And I thought, ‘Oh, great!’ And then I’m thinking, ‘Oh, crap! What am I going to do?’”

Strathdee would place cool cloths on her husband's forehead during his extended illness to try to break his many fevers. Steffanie Strathdee

What she accomplished next could easily be called miraculous. First, Strathdee found an obscure treatment that offered a glimmer of hope — fighting superbugs with phages, viruses created by nature to eat bacteria.

Then she convinced phage scientists around the country to hunt and peck through molecular haystacks of sewage, bogs, ponds, the bilge of boats and other prime breeding grounds for bacteria and their viral opponents. The impossible goal: quickly find the few, exquisitely unique phages capable of fighting a specific strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria literally eating her husband alive.

Next, the US Food and Drug Administration had to greenlight this unproven cocktail of hope, and scientists had to purify the mixture so that it wouldn’t be deadly.

Yet just three weeks later, Strathdee watched doctors intravenously inject the mixture into her husband’s body — and save his life.

Their story is one of unrelenting perseverance and unbelievable good fortune. It’s a glowing tribute to the immense kindness of strangers. And it’s a story that just might save countless lives from the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant superbugs — maybe even your own.

“It’s estimated that by 2050, 10 million people per year — that’s one person every three seconds — is going to be dying from a superbug infection,” Strathdee told an audience at Life Itself, a 2022 health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN.

“I’m here to tell you that the enemy of my enemy can be my friend. Viruses can be medicine.”

A terrifying vacation

During a Thanksgiving cruise on the Nile in 2015, Patterson was suddenly felled by severe stomach cramps. When a clinic in Egypt failed to help his worsening symptoms, Patterson was flown to Germany, where doctors discovered a grapefruit-size abdominal abscess filled with Acinetobacter baumannii, a virulent bacterium resistant to nearly all antibiotics.

Found in the sands of the Middle East, the bacteria were blown into the wounds of American troops hit by roadside bombs during the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname “Iraqibacter.”

“Veterans would get shrapnel in their legs and bodies from IED explosions and were medevaced home to convalesce,” Strathdee told CNN, referring to improvised explosive devices. “Unfortunately, they brought their superbug with them. Sadly, many of them survived the bomb blasts but died from this deadly bacterium.”

Today, Acinetobacter baumannii tops the World Health Organization’s list of dangerous pathogens for which new antibiotics are critically needed.

“It’s something of a bacterial kleptomaniac. It’s really good at stealing antimicrobial resistance genes from other bacteria,” Strathdee said. “I started to realize that my husband was a lot sicker than I thought and that modern medicine had run out of antibiotics to treat him.”

With the bacteria growing unchecked inside him, Patterson was soon medevaced to the couple’s hometown of San Diego, where he was a professor of psychiatry and Strathdee was the associate dean of global health sciences at the University of California, San Diego.

“Tom was on a roller coaster — he’d get better for a few days, and then there would be a deterioration, and he would be very ill,” said Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, a leading infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who was a longtime friend and colleague. As weeks turned into months, “Tom began developing multi-organ failure. He was sick enough that we could lose him any day.”

Searching for a needle in a haystack

After that reassuring hand squeeze from her husband, Strathdee sprang into action. Scouring the internet, she had already stumbled across a study by a Tbilisi, Georgia, researcher on the use of phages for treatment of drug-resistant bacteria.

A phone call later, Strathdee discovered phage treatment was well established in former Soviet bloc countries but had been discounted long ago as “fringe science” in the West.

“Phages are everywhere. There’s 10 million trillion trillion — that’s 10 to the power of 31 — phages that are thought to be on the planet,” Strathdee said. “They’re in soil, they’re in water, in our oceans and in our bodies, where they are the gatekeepers that keep our bacterial numbers in check. But you have to find the right phage to kill the bacterium that is causing the trouble.”

Buoyed by her newfound knowledge, Strathdee began reaching out to scientists who worked with phages: “I wrote cold emails to total strangers, begging them for help,” she said at Life Itself.

One stranger who quickly answered was Texas A&M University biochemist Ryland Young. He’d been working with phages for over 45 years.

“You know the word persuasive? There’s nobody as persuasive as Steffanie,” said Young, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics who runs the lab at the university’s Center for Phage Technology. “We just dropped everything. No exaggeration, people were literally working 24/7, screening 100 different environmental samples to find just a couple of new phages.”

‘No problem’

While the Texas lab burned the midnight oil, Schooley tried to obtain FDA approval for the injection of the phage cocktail into Patterson. Because phage therapy has not undergone clinical trials in the United States, each case of “compassionate use” required a good deal of documentation. It’s a process that can consume precious time.

But the woman who answered the phone at the FDA said, “‘No problem. This is what you need, and we can arrange that,’” Schooley recalled. “And then she tells me she has friends in the Navy that might be able to find some phages for us as well.”

In fact, the US Naval Medical Research Center had banks of phages gathered from seaports around the world. Scientists there began to hunt for a match, “and it wasn’t long before they found a few phages that appeared to be active against the bacterium,” Strathdee said.

Back in Texas, Young and his team had also gotten lucky. They found four promising phages that ravaged Patterson’s antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a test tube. Now the hard part began — figuring out how to separate the victorious phages from the soup of bacterial toxins left behind.

“You put one virus particle into a culture, you go home for lunch, and if you’re lucky, you come back to a big shaking, liquid mess of dead bacteria parts among billions and billions of the virus,” Young said. “You want to inject those virus particles into the human bloodstream, but you’re starting with bacterial goo that’s just horrible. You would not want that injected into your body.”

Purifying phage to be given intravenously was a process that no one had yet perfected in the US, Schooley said, “but both the Navy and Texas A&M got busy, and using different approaches figured out how to clean the phages to the point they could be given safely.”

More hurdles: Legal staff at Texas A&M expressed concern about future lawsuits. “I remember the lawyer saying to me, ‘Let me see if I get this straight. You want to send unapproved viruses from this lab to be injected into a person who will probably die.’ And I said, “Yeah, that’s about it,’” Young said.

“But Stephanie literally had speed dial numbers for the chancellor and all the people involved in human experimentation at UC San Diego. After she calls them, they basically called their counterparts at A&M, and suddenly they all began to work together,” Young added.

“It was like the parting of the Red Sea — all the paperwork and hesitation disappeared.”

‘It was just miraculous’

The purified cocktail from Young’s lab was the first to arrive in San Diego. Strathdee watched as doctors injected the Texas phages into the pus-filled abscesses in Patterson’s abdomen before settling down for the agonizing wait.

“We started with the abscesses because we didn’t know what would happen, and we didn’t want to kill him,” Schooley said. “We didn’t see any negative side effects; in fact, Tom seemed to be stabilizing a bit, so we continued the therapy every two hours.”

Two days later, the Navy cocktail arrived. Those phages were injected into Patterson’s bloodstream to tackle the bacteria that had spread to the rest of his body.

“We believe Tom was the first person to receive intravenous phage therapy to treat a systemic superbug infection in the US,” Strathdee told CNN.

“And three days later, Tom lifted his head off the pillow out of a deep coma and kissed his daughter’s hand. It was just miraculous.”

Patterson awoke from a coma after receiving an intravenous dose of phages tailored to his bacteria. Steffanie Strathdee

Damaged but not broken

Today, nearly eight years later, Patterson is happily retired, walking 3 miles a day and gardening. But the long illness took its toll: He was diagnosed with diabetes and is now insulin dependent, with mild heart damage and gastrointestinal issues that affect his diet.

“He isn’t back surfing again, because he can’t feel the bottoms of his feet, and he did get Covid-19 in April that landed him in the hospital because the bottoms of his lungs are essentially dead,” Strathdee said.

“As soon as the infection hit his lungs he couldn’t breathe and I had to rush him to the hospital, so that was scary,” she said. “He remains high risk for Covid but we’re not letting that hold us hostage at home. He says, ‘I want to go back to having as normal life as fast as possible.’”

To prove it, the couple are again traveling the world — they recently returned from a 12-day trip to Argentina.

“We traveled with a friend who is an infectious disease doctor, which gave me peace of mind to know that if anything went sideways, we’d have an expert at hand,” Strathdee said.

“I guess I’m a bit of a helicopter wife in that sense. Still, we’ve traveled to Costa Rica a couple of times, we’ve been to Africa, and we’re planning to go to Chile in January.”

A legacy

Patterson’s case was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in 2017, jump-starting new scientific interest in phage therapy.

“There’s been an explosion of clinical trials that are going on now in phage (science) around the world and there’s phage programs in Canada, the UK, Australia, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, India and China has a new one, so it’s really catching on,” Strathdee told CNN.

Some of the work is focused on the interplay between phages and antibiotics — as bacteria battle phages they often shed their outer shell to keep the enemy from docking and gaining access for the kill. When that happens, the bacteria may be suddenly vulnerable to antibiotics again.

“We don’t think phages are ever going to entirely replace antibiotics, but they will be a good adjunct to antibiotics. And in fact, they can even make antibiotics work better,” Strathdee said.

In San Diego, Strathdee and Schooley opened the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, or IPATH, in 2018, where they treat or counsel patients suffering from multidrug-resistant infections. The center’s success rate is high, with 82% of patients undergoing phage therapy experiencing a clinically successful outcome, according to its website.

Schooley is running a clinical trial using phages to treat patients with cystic fibrosis who constantly battle Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a drug-resistant bacteria that was also responsible for the recent illness and deaths connected to contaminated eye drops manufactured in India.

And a memoir the couple published in 2019 — “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug” — is also spreading the word about these “perfect predators” to what may soon be the next generation of phage hunters.

“I am getting increasingly contacted by students, some as young as 12,” Strathdee said. “There’s a girl in San Francisco who begged her mother to read this book and now she’s doing a science project on phage-antibiotic synergy, and she’s in eighth grade. That thrills me.”

Strathdee is quick to acknowledge the many people who helped save her husband’s life. But those who were along for the ride told CNN that she and Patterson made the difference.

“I think it was a historical accident that could have only happened to Steffanie and Tom,” Young said. “They were at UC San Diego, which is one of the premier universities in the country. They worked with a brilliant infectious disease doctor who said, ‘Yes,’ to phage therapy when most physicians would’ve said, ‘Hell, no, I won’t do that.’

“And then there is Steffanie’s passion and energy — it’s hard to explain until she’s focused it on you. It was like a spiderweb; she was in the middle and pulled on strings,” Young added. “It was just meant to be because of her, I think.”","['phages', 'saved', 'bacteria', 'patterson', 'young', 'life', 'schooley', 'woman', 'superbug', 'strathdee', 'phage', 'san', 'told', 'diego', 'crisis', 'husbands']","Yet just three weeks later, Strathdee watched doctors intravenously inject the mixture into her husband’s body — and save his life.

357,"Who came out on top, and who lost out from the OpenAI leadership crisis?","CNN —

The leadership crisis that engulfed OpenAI for nearly a week ended almost as abruptly as it began: With a terse, cryptic announcement by the company that would have enormous ramifications for its future.

In some ways, the outcome was a return to the status quo: Sam Altman would be restored as CEO, with the company’s deep and lucrative business partnership with Microsoft, which took a $13 billion stake in the company even as it ramps up its own AI research efforts, left intact.

But in other ways, the agreement is still a watershed moment for OpenAI and the artificial intelligence field writ large.

The tumultuous week seems to have resulted in a big victory for Altman personally; proponents of widespread AI adoption; and some of the country’s most established elites. And it came at the expense of AI skeptics who, by many accounts, bungled an attempt to make a principled stand for caution about the technology’s long-term risks.

Who came out on top

Sam Altman A clear winner in the whole debacle is, of course, Altman himself. Unceremoniously ejected from his post on Friday, Altman quickly rallied support from the vast majority of OpenAI’s staff, who signed what was essentially a loyalty pledge underscoring the deep rift between himself and the board. His return to OpenAI, in triumph over the board that summarily fired him, reflects a kind of personal vindication that’s only likely to bolster, for better or for worse, his carefully and intentionally constructed image as a charismatic visionary who is single-handedly unlocking the secrets of the universe.

Microsoft Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has sought to downplay the tech giant’s part in the crisis, insisting on Monday — before Altman’s reappointment — that whatever happens with OpenAI, “nothing changes.” Microsoft’s priority, Nadella said, was to ensure uninterrupted delivery of AI technology to its own customers, whether that meant Altman being hired by Microsoft or his reinstallation at OpenAI.

But Microsoft is hardly a disinterested party, having committed billions to OpenAI in a multi-year partnership that’s led to the tech giant integrating ChatGPT into Bing search and other Microsoft products. Now, Microsoft is poised to gain even more influence. Nadella hinted at this reality on Monday, signaling that if Altman were to return as OpenAI’s CEO, Microsoft would have a very strong opinion on how the AI startup is governed.

“One thing I’ll be very, very clear [about] is, we’re never going to get back into a situation where we get surprised like this ever again,” Nadella said. “If we go back to operating like on Friday, we will make sure we are very, very clear that the governance gets fixed in a way that we really have more surety and guarantee that we don’t have surprises.”

Whether that could mean having a board observer or a full-fledged seat on OpenAI’s board, he said, is a bridge “we’ll cross… if it happens.”

Taylor isn’t just a former CEO of one of the tech industry’s biggest companies. He’s a former chief technology officer of Facebook, and in 2022, as the chair of Twitter, successfully forced Elon Musk to follow through with his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company, in a momentous bit of corporate maneuvering.

Summers, meanwhile, is the former president of Harvard University who has attracted controversy for suggesting that “innate differences” are the reason for women’s underrepresentation in scientific professions. The remark was widely criticized as sexist and Summers subsequently apologized.

Who came out on bottom

The push to slow AI development In the same way that the deal breathes new life into Altman’s mythos, so does it give a tailwind to the ideology he represents: a belief in the rapid commercialization of generative AI. With some of the apparent architects of Altman’s ouster being pushed out themselves, a casualty of the affair may be the perspectives that those board members espoused. That seems to include a deep fear about the long-term, potentially even existential risks of AI.

In the letter signed by hundreds of OpenAI staffers threatening to quit, employees reported that board members claimed allowing the company to be destroyed “would be consistent with the mission” of OpenAI, which is to “ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”

That OpenAI’s board apparently believed the company’s destruction would benefit society reflects the concerns of a vocal camp in the AI field that has called for pauses in AI development, more research to “align” AI with human-centered values, and concerns about the unchecked power of a truly sentient super-intelligence. Emmett Shear, whom the board named OpenAI’s interim CEO for all of two days, has also expressed similar worries. In the fallout of the leadership crisis, some have argued that the outcome is also a defeat for effective altruism, the movement with which some OpenAI board members are said to be affiliated.

OpenAI does not appear to be on the brink of an all-out AI sprint that disregards risk entirely. Summers has been vocal about AI’s near-term impacts on labor. And after having wowed US lawmakers by calling for AI regulation, Altman will likely continue to be a prominent figure in the global debate over rules for artificial intelligence.

Still, deserved or not, the dispute appears to have done long-term damage to the credibility of certain deep skeptics of AI, and lifted the fortunes of the Microsofts and Altmans of the world who are pushing to get artificial intelligence into the hands of the public. And that may have untold ripple effects for AI development for years to come.","['altman', 'openai', 'board', 'microsoft', 'ceo', 'openais', 'came', 'company', 'summers', 'ai', 'nadella', 'leadership', 'crisis', 'lost']","CNN —The leadership crisis that engulfed OpenAI for nearly a week ended almost as abruptly as it began: With a terse, cryptic announcement by the company that would have enormous ramifications for its future.

358,Democrats accuse X of profiting from Hamas propaganda,"Washington CNN —

A group of House Democrats has accused X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, of profiting from Hamas propaganda and misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war after reports by independent researchers found numerous accounts glorifying the US-sanctioned terror group.

More than two dozen US lawmakers signed the letter dated Tuesday addressed to X owner Elon Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino.

Citing analyses by groups including the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, NewsGuard and the Tech Transparency Project, Tuesday’s letter said lawmakers were “outraged by the clear indicators that X is profiting from the spread of Hamas’s terrorist propaganda — both through monthly subscription fees collected from some propaganda spreaders, and through ads displayed in replies to posts by both Premium and regular accounts.”

One of the reports in question, published last month, claimed to have identified examples of paid X subscribers sharing videos bearing Hamas iconography and depicting violent or gruesome images. Another report claimed to have identified dozens of paid X subscriber accounts promoting “false or unsubstantiated narratives relating to the war” and that posts spreading the misinformation had been viewed at least 100 million times globally.

“Given X’s major cuts to content moderation staff over the last year, it appears that X has willfully permitted, and benefited from, the illegal spread of terrorist propaganda,” wrote the group, led by Reps. Adam Schiff of California, Daniel Goldman of New York and Jamie Raskin of Maryland. “Such behavior from one of the world’s most widely used social media platforms is wholly unacceptable.”

X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawmakers’ accusations.

A new report released by NewsGuard on Wednesday claimed that ads for 86 major advertisers, including Pizza Hut, Airbnb and Microsoft, were shown on viral posts that pushed false or misleading claims about the Israel-Hamas war. The posts were seen by a total of 92 million users on X, according to NewsGuard.

X released a statement in advance of the NewsGuard report’s publication, calling its findings into question. X could not be reached for further comment Wednesday evening.

On Tuesday, Musk abruptly announced that X would be donating “all revenue from advertising & subscriptions associated with the war in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza.” But it was unclear what content he was referring to and whether the announcement was directly related to the lawmakers’ letter. X Head of Business Operations Joe Benarroch declined to clarify the company’s plans beyond saying the donation would be “a sizeable amount.”

The pressure from House Democrats comes amid a wider blowback to X over extremist content on the platform, in some cases amplified directly by Musk himself. In recent days, X has suffered a notable exodus of high-profile advertisers following Musk’s public embrace of an antisemitic conspiracy theory popular with White supremacists and a report by Media Matters, the progressive media watchdog group, that said major brands’ advertisements appeared beside pro-Nazi content.

Musk sued Media Matters on Monday, accusing it of distorting the likelihood that ads may be shown against extremist material. But some legal critics have cast doubt on the complaint, calling it “weak” and “bogus” in the face of the First Amendment.

Tuesday’s letter also highlights the mounting public scrutiny of Yaccarino, who until now has sought to position herself as a cheery counterweight to Musk’s flirtation with far-right extremism. The letter calls for Yaccarino and Musk to answer by December 1 to allegations that X has amplified terrorist propaganda in violation of its own policies.

It comes a day after the Senate Judiciary Committee said it had enlisted the US Marshals Service, in a rare move, to serve Yaccarino with a subpoena personally, compelling her to testify at a December 6 hearing on children’s online safety. In a release, the committee said it was forced to take that extraordinary measure after X declined to accept the subpoena on Yaccarino’s behalf, in a “remarkable departure from typical practice.”","['hamas', 'terrorist', 'media', 'letter', 'posts', 'musk', 'yaccarino', 'democrats', 'lawmakers', 'propaganda', 'x', 'war', 'profiting', 'accuse']","Washington CNN —A group of House Democrats has accused X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, of profiting from Hamas propaganda and misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war after reports by independent researchers found numerous accounts glorifying the US-sanctioned terror group.

359,"Spotify to slash royalties for rain sounds, white noise and other non-music tracks","CNN —

Spotify’s new royalty system means so-called functional noises like the sound of rainfall will earn significantly less than traditional music files.

In an attempt to crack down on “bad actors” using the genre to fraudulently generate revenue, Spotify announced in a blog post Tuesday it would be increasing the minimum track length for functional noise recordings to two minutes, as well as valuing streams of the sounds at a “fraction of the value” of music track streams.

A sound featuring 30 seconds of white noise has thus far been worth the same as an artist’s original music track, creating a “revenue opportunity for noise uploaders well beyond their contribution to listeners,” according to Spotify, and creating frustration throughout the music industry.

Until now, creators of functional sounds have been able to game Spotify’s streaming system to maximize revenue with minimal effort. Since streaming royalties are paid out partly based on the amount of times a track is played and sounds like white noise are often listened to for hours, Spotify says creators are shortening sounds to as little as 30 seconds (the platform’s current minimum track length) and looping playlists so that the same clip gets listened to over and over again, bumping up streaming numbers and royalty cash outs.

While Spotify did not state how much the platform would be devaluing the streams, Billboard reported that functional tracks would now be worth one-fifth of their music counterparts.

The functional genre includes nature sounds, white noise, sound effects and silence recordings.

“It can’t be that an Ed Sheeran stream is worth exactly the same as a stream of rain falling on the roof,” Robert Kync, Warner Music Group CEO, said in a May earnings call, a sentiment echoed by other music executives.

“Obviously white noise is very different from ‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ but it, currently under this model, is paid the same,” Marina Guz, chief commercial officer at Endel, an AI-driven functional music company partnered with Universal Music Group, told CNN.

Guz explained that there has been rising pressure from labels and artists to change the way Spotify makes distinctions between functional noise and music.

“There’s been an ongoing conversation this entire year of the value of music and how something like someone just putting up white noise is different than paying for an artist that had spent a year in the studio making the album with all kinds of instruments and people involved,” Guz told CNN.

In another attempt to clamp down on malicious behavior, the platform announced Tuesday it is moving to charge labels and distributors by track when “flagrant” artificial streaming is suspected. Artificial streaming is when streams counts are increased fraudulently, such as through bots. The company is also making changes to its royalty system, moving to only compensate tracks that generate more than 1000 streams.

Spotify has also come under scrutiny for white noise podcasts, with Bloomberg reporting in 2023 that podcasts featuring only ambient sounds were accounting for three million daily consumption hours and accidentally being boosted by Spotify’s own algorithm, resulting in a $38 million loss in potential annual profits. Creators of such podcasts could reportedly rake in as much as $18,000 a month in ads, Bloomberg found in 2022.

Spotify’s changes will roll out early next year.","['royalties', 'streaming', 'music', 'nonmusic', 'worth', 'system', 'white', 'slash', 'track', 'noise', 'rain', 'tracks', 'spotify', 'functional', 'sounds']","A sound featuring 30 seconds of white noise has thus far been worth the same as an artist’s original music track, creating a “revenue opportunity for noise uploaders well beyond their contribution to listeners,” according to Spotify, and creating frustration throughout the music industry.

360,Jack Ma backs off on plans to sell Alibaba shares after stock plunge,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

Jack Ma has put off plans to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Alibaba shares after the Chinese tech giant’s stock plummeted last week.

Two regulatory filings from last Thursday revealed that Ma had been looking to offload 10 million shares, worth nearly $871 million.

But because the company’s stock price has fallen below the billionaire’s expectations, he has not sold “a single share,” according to a Wednesday post from Alibaba (BABA) Chief People Officer Jane Jiang Fang on the company’s internal forum seen by CNN.

The sales were initially planned to take place this Tuesday through JC Properties and JSP Investment, two entities linked to Ma and his philanthropic foundation, according to the filings.

The disclosure of the intended sales came the same day Alibaba reported third quarter earnings, when it announced that it would drop plans to spin off its cloud computing arm partly due to uncertainties caused by US controls on chip exports to China.

Alibaba’s stock plunged 9% in New York on Thursday and nearly 10% in Hong Kong on Friday, wiping out about $20 billion from the company’s market value.

So far this year, Alibaba’s shares have fallen more than 10%.

Jiang said the fact that both pieces of news came at the same time was just a “coincidence.”

The news of the sale had triggered rumors that Ma had lost confidence in the company, but Jiang urged employees to dismiss such speculation. The executive said the transactions were part of a long-term plan laid out in August, which would allow Ma’s office to invest in agricultural technology and welfare projects both in and outside China.

Ma believes that the Hangzhou-based firm’s stock “is currently significantly lower than Alibaba’s actual value, and he will not sell it,” she said.

Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai also weighed in, writing in a comment on the same post seen by CNN that he had “full confidence” in the company.

On Friday, Ma’s office told the South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong newspaper owned by Alibaba, that he remained “very positive” about the company’s prospects, despite plans for “a partial sell-down.”

Ma’s foundation and Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the matter, or whether the share sale would proceed if the company’s stock price rebounded.

The group is currently in the midst of a major restructuring, which was announced in March and originally intended to result in a split of six separate units, each overseen by its own chief executive and board of directors.

But last week, Alibaba said it would rethink plans not just for its cloud business, but for a listing of its grocery chain Freshippo, citing a need to “evaluate market conditions.”

Ma founded Alibaba in 1999. He stepped down as chairman of the company in 2019, about a year before landing in hot water with Chinese authorities for criticizing Chinese financial regulators and banks. Since then, the entrepreneur has kept a relatively low profile while remaining an Alibaba shareholder.","['kong', 'plans', 'shares', 'backs', 'companys', 'stock', 'chinese', 'post', 'jack', 'ma', 'worth', 'alibaba', 'sell', 'plunge']","Hong Kong CNN —Jack Ma has put off plans to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Alibaba shares after the Chinese tech giant’s stock plummeted last week.

361,Solid state batteries promise to radically change EVs. But they may not be the only answer,"CNN —

Electric cars are supposed to be the future, but they still have issues that are keeping away many car buyers. The range is too short. The batteries are too heavy and expensive. They take too long to charge. But a number of companies say they have the technology to solve many — maybe even all — of these problems.

Toyota, in particular, has said it might be on the cusp of such a breakthrough. Other automakers are also working with various battery companies on versions of this new technology.

The would-be breakthrough is called a “solid state battery,” and the only problem is that — much like other vaunted Earth-changing technologies — for a few years now, it’s always been just a couple of years away.

Car companies including Stellantis, Hyundai and Volkswagen have also teamed up with firms working on solid state batteries. The technology holds the promise of batteries that are smaller and lighter while providing more power. They could be safer with less chance of catching fire in a crash, too.

But solid state technology has its own challenges, and it’s not the only way automakers could achieve lighter, cheaper and faster charging electric vehicles.

Battery basics

The main difference between a solid state battery and the lithium-ion batteries currently used in electric cars is a component known as the electrolyte. In a lithium-ion battery, the electrolyte is a gooey liquid. In a solid state battery, the electrolyte is, well, a solid. That solid electrolyte is one reason that solid state batteries might be safer than lithium-ion batteries. If a liquid electrolyte battery is broken or punctured, the two sides of the electrolyte can ooze together, which can lead to an uncontrolled energy flow, followed by a fire.

Generally speaking, solids are also denser than liquids meaning the electrolyte takes up less space and battery cells can be smaller. But some companies are working on other strategies, as well, that can make batteries still smaller and lighter and, also, faster charging.

The main challenge for all of these companies, and the automakers that have invested in them, is how to produce these hi-tech batteries economically in the sort of numbers needed to build affordable electric cars. Meanwhile, there are competing battery technologies for which manufacturing techniques are well established.

It’s a wide-open field right now with a number of start-up companies each working with different chemical combinations and even slightly different physical structures for their batteries. There’s still no clearly superior technology, said William Kephart, a battery researcher at the consulting firm P3 Group

Fast charging times, a key consumer demand, is one challenge for solid-state batteries. Generally, it takes the lithium ions in the batteries used currently more time to move through a rigid material than a liquid, Kephart said. That tends to make it take longer to receive energy, which slows charging times, and makes it slower to release energy — which drags on a vehicle’s acceleration.

Solid-state battery company Quantumscape claims that its solid-state batteries — which use some liquid, but not for the electrolyte — have been tested and can charge even faster than typical lithium ion batteries.

Solid-state batteries will tend to be more expensive because they contain more lithium, which is expensive, said Kephart. Lithium prices will come down as more sources are found and accessed, he said, but, compared to other batteries, solid-state batteries will tend to cost more.

A company called Factorial, which counts Stellantis and Mercedes as investors, claims its solid-state battery technology uses less lithium than traditional batteries, which could potentially reduce costs, especially as production ramps up.

“We think the costing actually will be competitive because lithium, just from the raw material perspective, it’s not a scarce material,” said Factorial chief executive Siyu Huang.

Quantumscape also say its battery design eliminates graphite, reducing expense and, the company claims, greatly reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing.

Other options

At the same time, though, some other battery companies are working to improve traditional liquid-electrolyte batteries, improvements that could make that existing technology better. Just changing the one piece of the battery by adding silicone could yield big improvements in performance at relatively low cost. That’s what’s proposed by a company called OneD Battery Sciences, in which GM has invested.

OneD’s technology allows production processes to stay roughly the same while promising big improvements in performance, according to the company. That means less trouble and expense for battery manufacturers and automakers.

Other companies are working on semi-solid state batteries that combine parts of each type of battery, providing some of the benefits of solid state without completely ditching the standard fluid-based design.

Ultimately, there probably will never be one battery technology used in all EVs, GM spokesperson Phil Lienert said. The type of batteries will be matched to the vehicle and the specific market where it’s sold. It’s similar to how automakers use different engines in various models and in different markets. GM’s Ultium electric vehicle design, which underlies all of GM’s EV models, was specifically engineered to enable the use of all different sorts of batteries.

“When you have a customer lineup as big and diverse as ours, you need to have multiple solutions that can coexist” within the same basic engineering, he said.","['batteries', 'electrolyte', 'solid', 'working', 'electric', 'technology', 'radically', 'promise', 'battery', 'lithium', 'answer', 'change', 'companies', 'state', 'evs']","Car companies including Stellantis, Hyundai and Volkswagen have also teamed up with firms working on solid state batteries.

362,Brands that have paused ads on X amid ongoing crisis for Elon Musk’s platform,"New York CNN —

At least a dozen major brands have halted ad spending on X, formerly Twitter, since its latest advertiser exodus began last week over concerns about antisemitism and hate speech on Elon Musk’s social media platform.

Fox Sports, Ubisoft, Axios, TechCrunch and Paris Hilton’s 11:11 Media all told CNN in recent days that they’d paused their ad spending on X, joining other large advertisers that jumped ship last week.

The ongoing exit of advertisers marks a deepening crisis for X, which was already struggling to woo brands back to the platform following Musk’s takeover last year. And it comes as growing numbers of X users also decamp to alternate platforms. The White House joined Threads this week, giving a boost to Meta’s X competitor.

The latest revolt began last week when IBM said it had suspended advertising on X after a report from progressive media watchdog Media Matters found its ad had run alongside pro-Nazi content on the platform. IBM’s decision also came after Musk had publicly endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory in a post on X earlier in the week.

On Friday, a slew of major media brands including Disney, Paramount, Comcast, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal and CNN-parent Warner Bros. Discovery followed suit, although they did not specify their reasons for halting advertising on X. Apple also reportedly pulled its ad spend on X as of last week, according to reports from multiple news outlets.

X has called on its advertising partners to help protect what it calls “freedom of speech.” The company on Monday filed a lawsuit accusing Media Matters of misrepresenting how likely it is for ads to run alongside extremist content on the site. X also said it had made the pro-Nazi accounts identified by Media Matters ineligible for monetization, meaning ads can no longer be run on their pages. And CEO Linda Yaccarino has continued to tout brand safety controls that the company says can help prevent ads from running beside objectionable content. (Media Matters has vowed to fight the lawsuit from X and says it stands by its reporting.)

But the company has done little else to reassure advertisers that its platform is safe. The pro-Nazi accounts identified by Media Matters remain active on the site, along with other far-right and White supremacist accounts, some of whom Musk had reinstated on the platform following his takeover. CNN on Wednesday observed ads for the University of Michigan running on the page of the X account belonging to Richard Spencer, a known White nationalist. (A University of Michigan spokesperson told CNN the university is “watching developments on X closely as we continue to evaluate our use of the platform.”)

Musk this week also boosted the years-old, debunked “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory that in 2016 prompted a gun-wielding man to fire shots inside a Washington, D.C., pizza shop.

Some advertisers have remained on X despite the hate speech concerns. The National Football League — one of the platform’s biggest ad partners — told CNN Tuesday that it had repeatedly expressed concerns about hate speech to X leadership directly, although it has not pulled its spending from the platform.

363,"Michael Jordan’s ultra-private, ultra-exclusive personal golf course: The Grove XXIII","CNN —

There’s one small corner of the world that Michael Jordan cherishes more than any other — his own personal haven of sporting bliss.

But it’s not in Chicago. In fact, there isn’t a basketball court or hoop in sight.

Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts.

The Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it.

For Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.”

And there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994.

Almost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015.

With Tiger Woods headlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect.

A meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client.

“I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN.

“I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.”

The land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach.

Weed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week.

Weed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants. Watching Jordan in discussion with the team during one early meeting, he got the impression of a coach interacting with his players.

“I think one of his qualities is he was such a good listener, and he absorbed everything that you were discussing,” Weed said.

“He didn’t come out and say ‘do this or do that.’ He came out and observed and was a great listener, and he let me do my job.”

“Slaughterhouse 23”

Weed had his two pillars for a great golf course — an engaged owner and a good piece of property, though the latter would require some polishing.

Turning a flat, “featureless” site – bordered by two long drainage canals – into a cross between the manicured, parkland style of Augusta National and the rustic layout of Pine Valley represented the greatest challenge to him and his team.

Dirt was excavated from lagoons to build the course and its features, fixing the flatness issue and leaving behind six large lakes – the same number of NBA Championships Jordan won. It was a coincidence, but ultimately fit the theme of a course tuned to the finest degree to its owner’s style.

Jordan wanted firm and fast, a course that could both excite and challenge its members, many of whom would be among the PGA Tour’s current stars. A double-helix layout, with a “crossover” at the 5th and 14th holes, offers the flexibility to play continual internal circuits in three, six, or nine-hole loops – ideal for Jordan’s busy schedule.

The course didn’t just need to suit the playstyle of its owner, though, it needed to enhance it.

“You don’t think I’m going to spend this much money and not have a little bit of an advantage do you?” Weed recalled Jordan saying.

Add to that the five-time MVP’s penchant for wagers, which will be familiar to viewers of docuseries “The Last Dance,” and the course has earned a new name among some members: “Slaughterhouse 23.”

“It’s his golf course, so it’s set up very well for him,” former world No. 1 Rickie Fowler told the Subpar podcast in 2020.

Weed, too, got drawn into the wagers, even during construction.

“I can remember us being out there hitting shots and doing a little gambling while we were just playing in the dirt. It was just great fun and interaction,” he said.

“It’s hard not to go out there and play a round with MJ without having a friendly wager.”

To meet the second requirement of Jordan’s brief, Weed’s team set aside 20 acres to construct a state-of-the-art practice facility that the designer believes has no equal.

Two 400-yard, double-sided driving lanes can be maintained for specific conditions, such as US Open or PGA Tour style fairways, with “target greens” in 25-yard increments. Each green has built-in pods that can track swathes of shot information, incorporating the PGA Tour’s ShotLink data.

The putting green is split into four quadrants, with incremental slopes ranging from 0-1% to 3-4% inclines. Even the grass on the tees is customizable, with different types to mimic warm or cool seasons.

“It’s a Tour player’s haven to work on their game,” said Weed.

Taking a swing

Compared to Bobby Weed Golf Design, Nichols Architects had considerably less experience in golf courses, but it did have one key advantage in its efforts to beat other bids to build The Grove XXIII’s clubhouse.

Specializing in hospitality, residential, and commercial design, the firm had worked on the W South Beach in Miami — the favorite hotel of Jordan’s wife Yvette Prieto.

The team pulled no punches with its pitch to Jordan. “You’re not going to confuse this clubhouse with a clubhouse down the road or anything like that, and that’s what we’re selling you,” planning and design partner Igor Reyes told CNN of the pitching process, likening it to that depicted in the “Air” movie, where Nike must lure a rookie Jordan away from a deal with Adidas.

“You’ve really got to make an architectural iconic shape, and a shape that you could almost immediately feel was swinging across the landscape. Hopefully you can almost read the concept without anybody having to tell you,” Reyes said.

The deal clincher — outlined to Jordan in a pitch video — was that clubhouse shape, inspired by the smooth, “almost machine-like” perfection of a golf swing.

Reyes said his team had heard of Jordan’s purported early struggles with his swing, and, in the video, set up a column grid to map the building’s structure onto Tiger Woods’ club trajectory. Jordan was captivated, and told the firm there and then that it would get the contract.

“The first time you walk into the room with him, you don’t want to get too close or anything like that, it was kind of an odd thing,” Reyes said. “But by the second or third meeting we were just talking to him like a ‘regular’ client with a huge amount of respect.

“There was a really a sense of, ‘This isn’t just a guy with a lot of money that wants to do something. This guy knows what he’s doing, he knows what he likes, and how to get to it.’”

The elephant in the roof

Inside, 15,000 square feet of space leaves ample room for men’s and women’s lockers, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, kitchen and dining facilities, and even a shop. Hospitality was a priority, with a below-ground level meaning all service, as well as golf cart storage, can be managed from underneath.

Like the course, Jordan’s identity was stamped all over. Columns were set further inside below an overhanging roof to mimic the hang-time that inspired the “Air Jordan” tag, while an elephant print used on some of his shoes was incorporated into the fritted-glass roof, casting the print across the floor when the sun shines through.

Like Weed, Reyes believes his job was made easier by an engaged client.

“He was involved with a lot of the decisions … we didn’t change a color without him knowing,” Reyes said.

“We have had work with other celebrity people and they won’t talk to you, it’s ‘I just want this’ and sort of like, ‘get out of the way.’ But he realized there was a lot of creativity going on and he wanted to be a part of it.”

“No other place I’d rather be”

Given Jordan’s regular on-site visits, there was no big reveal for the owner when the Grove XXIII officially opened in the fall of 2019, but there was a revelation when Weed joined him for his very first round.

When play finished, the architect found himself wrapped in a 6-foot, 6-inch bear hug.

“He looked at me and said, ‘I’m fortunate enough I can be anywhere in the world, but there’s no other place I’d rather be than right here,’” Weed recalled.

“That’s like the ultimate compliment … to have his own golf course and to shape and mold that golf course for him and his friends, it’s just where he wants to be. It’s just a great spot and evolved into something fantastic.

“He’s going to enjoy it as long as he’s playing and then it’s going to get passed along to the next generation — it’s just one of the great things about golf and why it has sustained itself over centuries.”","['bobby', 'weed', 'team', 'jordans', 'jordan', 'ultraexclusive', 'michael', 'xxiii', 'personal', 'shape', 'pga', 'course', 'design', 'ultraprivate', 'grove', 'golf']","Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course.

364,Six bull sharks inadvertently made their home on an Australian golf course. Then they vanished,"CNN —

For golfers, staying out of the water could be the difference between winning and losing. At one course in Australia, it was the difference between life and death.

Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks.

From their mysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard.

Arrival

A lake on a landlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats.

River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks have organs specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium.

Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s.

Neither did severe flooding.

Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions including in 1991, 1995 and 1996.

The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters.

As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013.

Carbrook’s Nessie

Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green.

There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast.

“The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN.

“It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.”

That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010.

Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat. No sooner had the bait hit the surface, a shark duly appeared.

The stunned Wagstaff snapped some shots before taking a short video on his phone to post online. The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: the viral YouTube video has amassed more than 2.3 million views to date.

Carbrook Golf Club Shark in the Lake

Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor.

A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls.

Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking.

Compared to the crocodiles and snakes dotting other courses in the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents. Only two risk-management steps were taken: warning signage around the lake, and the rejection of any business from prospective golf ball divers, who retrieve balls from course lakes to sell them on.

“It’s just not worth the few grand a year we get for a contract to put someone’s life at risk,” Wagstaff said.

Unprecedented

Fascination spread far beyond Australian borders, piquing the interest of one shark-loving scientist and researcher based at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany.

Dr. Peter Gausmann published his study on the Carbrook sharks, titled “Who’s the biggest fish in the pond?” in the Marine and Fishery Sciences journal in August 2023. Their extended residence, he argued, sheds new light on just how adaptable bull sharks are.

Even without the staff feeding the sharks, hunger was not a cause for concern in a lake 700 meters long, 380 meters wide and 15 meters deep, teeming with fish, from mullets to tarpons and snappers.

Gausmann calculated that the sharks would need to consume half a ton of fish per year – or 0.44% of their body weight per day – to meet their energy needs. Having been juveniles when they arrived, sightings verified they had grown to a healthy range of between 1.8 and 3 meters by 2013.

Only twice before had bull sharks been recorded surviving for years in isolated bodies of water, according to Gausmann, yet none had ever lasted so long.

One group made it at least four years in Panama’s freshwater Lake Bayano in the 1980s, while another survived a decade of high salinity in South Africa’s Lake St. Lucia after becoming trapped in 2002.

A stay of at least 17 years in low-salinity waters — more than half a bull shark’s lifespan — was unprecedented.

“This out of the ordinary occurrence has shown verifiably for the first time how long bull sharks are able to survive in these low-salinity environments,” Gausmann told CNN.

“The study has shown that bull sharks presumably have no limits to their residential time in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers, and they are presumably – at least theoretically – able to spend their entire lifetime in these habitats.”

Vanished

Sadly for Gausmann and Carbrook, the true extent of their survivability remains unknown.

It’s been eight years since a shark was last spotted in the lake. Their vanishing is a mystery, even to Gausmann.

Sightings dropped in frequency after the 2013 floods, leading to fears that some sharks may have returned to the river or died as a result of the storm. Just two sharks were confirmed dead; one found floating on the surface, another killed by illegal fishing.

Wagstaff, who had never noticed any sign of ill health among the sharks in more than 100 sightings, saw them only fleetingly after the fishing death. Gausmann believes it was unlikely the remaining sharks died in a “natural way” due to sodium loss or by any other “anatomical” failure, given their adaptability, and therefore theorizes that further illegal fishing is the “most likely” explanation for their disappearance.

Whatever the reason, it’s an absence felt keenly by the club.

“You can’t help yourself – you walk along the lake and you’re looking in, waiting to maybe catch a glimpse of a fin breaking the water,” Wagstaff said.

“The members loved the fact that their golf course was their unique place in the world where we had sharks; they just embraced it.

“We’d love to see them again.”

Last year, the course was submerged by the biggest flood ever recorded in the area, Wagstaff said. Though devastating financially, closing the club for two months, it sparked hope that new sharks may have crossed from the river to repopulate the lake.

Only time will tell, but Carbrook is already planning for a future without its mascot. Plans are in place to fill in the lake and build a new course there over the next decade, with all marine life – potential sharks included – subsequently relocated into waters elsewhere.

Whether Wagstaff ever spots another fin in the lake or not, he will remember “Patch” and co. fondly as the guests who helped him overcome his fears. Once afraid of the ocean due to sharks, Wagstaff recently went scuba diving in the reefs of the Sunshine Coast to get up close and personal with some large grey nurse sharks.

“There’s this kind of legend about sharks being aggressive because they’re coming into contact with humans, especially bull sharks because of the places they tend to swim – canals, creeks and rivers,” Wagstaff said.

“But then to experience them in such close proximity and see how beautiful they are and how graceful they are – now I just find them fascinating, especially the bull shark.

“They’re capable, so adaptive, and they are seriously beautiful when you’re a few feet away. It’s an incredible shark.”","['vanished', 'water', 'inadvertently', 'sharks', 'australian', 'club', 'carbrook', 'bull', 'lake', 'course', 'wagstaff', 'shark', 'river', 'golf']","Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks.

367,Hornussen: The dangerous Swiss golf-baseball hybrid you've never heard of,"CNN —

To most people, the words Swiss sport and Emmental might trigger thoughts of Roger Federer eating cheese.

Yet to those familiar with the sprawling countryside and farmlands of the Swiss heartland region where the cheese originated, there’s been a traditional game synonymous with the area for centuries.

Sending projectiles hurtling through the air at 200 miles per hour, all rise – and then duck – for Hornussen.

Risk and reward

Described as a hybrid of baseball and golf, Hornussen sees two teams of 18 take turns hitting and fielding the “Nouss” or “Hornuss,” a puck named after hornets for its buzzing sound as it whistles through the air.”

Armed with a 3-meter (9.84-foot) carbon stick called a “Träf,” hitters take to a raised batting ramp in front of a playing area – the “Ries” – some 300 meters (980 feet) long and 10 meters (32 feet) wide. Their task is to strike the puck from the sloped platform, known as the “Bock,” as far as they can down the field.

Scoring starts if they reach the 100-meter line, with an additional point awarded for every 10 meters past the marker. Crucially though, points are only registered if the Nouss lands, with fielders spread at intervals seeking to block the puck from landing with bats, or “Schindels.”

The sport’s format has drawn comparisons to golf, with some even suggesting it was a forerunner to the sport’s modern incarnation.

“The similarity is that like a ball, you hit a puck, and you hit it far away, but here you want to make some goals, not holes,” said Michael Kummer, member of national championship winning team Hochstetten Hornussen.

“People from other countries call Hornussen the ‘Farmer’s Golf’, so I think there’s some similarities.”

Yet while in golf only an errant shot is likely to present any danger to others, in Hornussen, putting yourself in harm’s way is an essential part of the game. With pucks of pressed plastic whizzing towards you at speeds akin to an F1 car, stopping them is a feat as treacherous as it is tricky. Though players often wear helmets and shielding gear, some take to the field without any such protection.

“It’s really dangerous if you don’t see the Nouss or if one hits the bat and, two meters before the face, the Nouss changes direction,” Kummer explained.

“If it goes in the eyes or around the head it’s really dangerous.”

‘The Lionel Messi of Hornussen’

Originating in the mid-17th century in the Emmental valley and, barring brief forays into neighboring Germany, Hornussen has never left Switzerland, with few teams existing outside the west-central canton of Bern.

The need for vast expanses of open grass to contest games forms part of the reason the sport has been limited to the rural area of Emmental, Kummer explains, adding that ventures into Germany ultimately fell short when teams couldn’t find enough players.

Yet for Kummer, it is this very rootedness in Switzerland that makes Hornussen – alongside yodeling and schwingen, a form of wrestling – a pillar of the nation’s sporting culture.

“With yodelling and schwingen it’s one of the three culture sports of Switzerland and we like it,” he said.

Around 260 teams are active across a multi-league pyramid in Switzerland, with the top teams fighting it out for the Swiss Championship.

And as winners of the last five titles, Kummer’s Hochstetten are very much the Bayern Munich of the Hornussen world.

With Hochstetten boasting a number of tall, strong players, at first glance it would seem that physical attributes are hugely influential in a team’s performance. Yet Kummer insists that size matters only up to a point.

“We have some big guys, but we also have small guys and it’s one of the nice things about this sport,” he said.

“The small guys can also make a good play in the field and they can hit the Nouss as long as the big guys.”

Take Kumer’ teammate Simon Ernie; though relatively diminutive in stature compared to some of his peers, Ernie was the league’s top scorer during his team’s most recent title winning campaign.

“He is the Lionel Messi of Hornussen, and he’s also a small guy,” Kummer said. “He’s one of the smallest on our team.”","['hornussen', 'puck', 'sport', 'swiss', 'golfbaseball', 'meters', 'nouss', 'heard', 'switzerland', 'hybrid', 'kummer', 'youve', 'teams', 'dangerous', 'golf']","CNN —To most people, the words Swiss sport and Emmental might trigger thoughts of Roger Federer eating cheese.

369,Bayard Rustin biopic spotlights organizer of the March on Washington,"CNN —

He stood 6-foot-1, weighed 190 pounds and moved with the grace of an athlete. A sharp dresser who favored linen shirts and stylish ties, Bayard Rustin sported a Clark Gable mustache and adopted a British accent that gave him an even more courtly bearing.

There was no civil rights leader who quite looked or spoke like Rustin. He was the Rev. Martin Luther King’s nonviolent spiritual mentor, the chief organizer of the epic 1963 March on Washington and an openly gay Black man who “never apologized for who he was, what he believed or who he desired” during an era when homosexuality was seen as a perversion deserving imprisonment.

“He looked great on a speaker’s platform,” says Arch Puddington, who worked with Rustin in the early 1970s at a labor organization that encouraged Black workers to be more active in unions.

“He’d get up and speak to some of these Black audiences and he could really set them on fire,” Puddington told CNN. “And he hardly ever spoke from a text. I would write text for him, and he would just completely ignore it.”

The man who organized what was then the largest peacetime protest in American history eventually became known as the movement’s “unsung hero,” largely fading into obscurity by his death in 1987.

But now Rustin is returning to the spotlight. “Rustin,” a biopic that depicts how Rustin navigated a gantlet of personal and political hurdles to pull off the March on Washington, debuts on Netflix today.

The film, made by Barack and Michelle Obama’s production company, comes amid a mini-Rustin renaissance. Recent months have also brought a new musical, “Bayard Rustin: Inside Ashland,” and a new book, “Bayard Rustin: A Legacy of Protest and Politics,” edited by Michael G. Long.

The new film is a good introduction to Rustin, and how social change takes place. Directed by George C. Wolfe, it crackles with energy. The actor Colman Domingo captures much of Rustin’s charisma and shrewd intelligence. The movie also reveals how some of the biggest battles civil rights leaders fought to put on the march were with one another, over turf and ego.

Much of the film’s urgency is a result of its tight focus. It’s structured around Rustin’s frantic campaign to organize the march, showing how he and 200 volunteers summoned 250,000 demonstrators to Washington with only two months for planning. They did so during an era of clattering typewriters, landline telephones and mimeograph machines — long before the internet or social media existed.

“It was the greatest moment in my life,” Rustin said in an oral history of the civil rights movement called “Voices of Freedom.”

It was one of the greatest moments in American history as well. The film, though, offers something more than a history lesson. It offers at least three lessons on leadership and social change.

Lesson 1: Character counts more than charisma

Character, it’s been said, is who you are when no one is watching. Rustin’s film, and his life, illustrates that lesson in several ways.

The civil rights movement was full of charismatic speakers. Yet many of its greatest leaders defined themselves not by what they said on camera, but by the decisions they made in private.

Malcolm X, for example, could fire up a crowd like few others. But his decision to break with Elijah Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam, helped seal his greatness. He knew his decision would likely cost him his life, but he was willing to take that chance because of his integrity.

King’s decision to oppose the Vietnam War was also widely unpopular. He lost the support of an American president, Black leaders turned against him and donations to the civil rights organization he co-founded dried up. But he did so because, like Malcolm, he shared a core commitment to his integrity.

Many pivotal moments in “Rustin,” and in the activist’ life, come down to the same moral calculus.

In a tense, private meeting depicted in the film, A. Philip Randolph (magnificently played by actor Glynn Turman) stands up for Rustin when other civil rights leaders tried to get him booted from the march because of his sexual orientation.

Rustin earned the respect of people like Randolph and King in part because of what he did when the cameras weren’t turned toward him.

He was a pacifist who went to prison during World War II rather than violate his beliefs. He did time on a chain gang and was viciously beaten several times for his activism but refused to retaliate because of his belief in nonviolence.

He also spent time in India studying Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolence, which he later passed on to King — leading some to call him the “American Gandhi.”

Rustin was deeply involved in virtually every major civil rights struggle of the mid-20th century, when many of those movements weren’t popular or covered by the press.

“He [Rustin] established a standard for honesty and fortitude that was unusually high in his era and much needed in ours,” Puddington wrote in one essay about Rustin.

Rustin’s character could also be seen in the way he handled his sexual orientation: no apologies; no double life.

During one scene of the film, he tells King he’s not going to hide who he is from other civil rights leaders.

“On the day I was born Black, I was also born a homosexual,” he says. “They either believe in freedom and justice for all or they do not.”

Lesson 2: Every movement needs a ‘glue’ person

General Omar Bradley, an American commander during World War II, is known to have said: “Amateurs talk strategy and professionals talk logistics.”

Bradley’s quote may be apocryphal, but it reflects a truism in warfare. The best-supplied armies often win. Battlefield victories often result not from clever strategies but from logistics — making sure troops have enough supplies and working equipment.

The same principle applies in sports. In the NBA, for example, there are certain unglamorous players on championship teams known as “glue guys.” They do the dirty work of setting screens, delivering hard fouls, rebounding and playing defense.

Rustin was the “glue guy” leader for the civil rights movement. Every movement needs one.

Rustin was a great organizer because he paid attention to details. He knew how many sandwiches and portable bathrooms the March on Washington participants needed. He knew how to raise money, how to charter buses to Washington and how to negotiate with sound engineers to make sure King’s voice could be heard across the Mall when he delivered his climatic “I Have a Dream” speech.

Watching Rustin organize the march in the film felt more exciting than the film’s depiction of the march itself.

There’s a scene in the movie where Ella Baker, one of the leaders of the civil rights movement who never got her due because of her gender, tells Rustin about the Ying and Yang every movement needs: a person in front and a logistical master behind the scenes. She sees that in Rustin’s partnership with King.

“On your own, you and Martin are fine,” she tells Rustin. “But together, you are fire.”

Lesson 3: Action without hope is impossible

The author Rebecca Solnit once wrote: “Hope calls for action; action is impossible without hope.”

Solnit says some of the biggest enemies of social change are cynicism and pessimism. Opponents of movements often try to convince demonstrators that they have no reason to expect they could win.

But Rustin had an ability to inspire marginalized people to believe they could win. One of the best passages in the film shows him molding a group of young, Black, brown and White civil rights activists into the crack team that would organize the March on Washington.

Rustin’s exuberance reflected the spirit of his time. He lived in another America full of can-do spirit. The country had defeated fascism during World War II; rebuilt Europe, pledged to send a man to the moon and wipe out poverty with President’s Johnson’s Great Society program. That optimism seeps through the movie.

Some of that patriotism may seem naïve now, but it furnished the civil rights movement with tremendous vitality. There are scenes in the film of Rustin mobilizing his young volunteers that conjure memoires of former President Obama’s first campaign, when young people across America bonded together for “hope and change.”

At one point in the film, a young organizer proposes a wild idea, and while others shout the person down, Rustin praises the volunteer.

“Don’t stifle an impulse before it’s born,” he shouts with a huge smile.

Optimism was a core organizing principle for Rustin, says Puddington, who is also a senior scholar emeritus at the Freedom House, a group that defends human rights and promotes democratic change throughout the world.

“Bayard was among those rare individuals who believed that if your cause was just and you had access to the basic tools of democracy, your time would come,” Puddington wrote in an essay about Rustin.

“For gay people today who live in democratic settings, Bayard’s optimism has been validated with each new victory for equality.”

Rustin refused to be defined by his race or sexual orientation

There is one risk that comes with renewed appreciation of Rustin: It’s easy to short-change his complexity. He’s invariably defined primarily through his sexual orientation – something his enemies often did.

But Rustin said his faith as a Quaker was central to his identity.

“My activism did not spring from my being Black,” he once said. “It is rooted fundamentally in my Quaker upbringing.”

This April 1969 file photo shows Rustin in his Park Avenue office in New York City. A Quaker and a pacifist, Rustin served as chief strategist for Martin Luther King's march but was kept mostly in the background because some organizers considered him a liability. A. Camerano/AP

Rustin said those Quaker values were built “on the concept of a single human family,” and that racial injustice was a challenge to that belief.

“It demanded my involvement in the struggle to achieve interracial democracy, “he said, “but it is very likely that I would have been involved had I been a White person with the same philosophy.”

Rustin has been called many labels: a great civil rights activist, a gay pioneer, an “American Gandhi,” and “Mr. March on Washington.” Maybe it’s time we call simply describe him the way the author Cathy Young once did in an essay:

As “a great American and a true hero.”

371,Water at Kealia pond in Hawaii has turned pink amid drought,"CNN —

A pond in Hawaii looks like something right out of a fairy tale. Water at the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge, one of the few coastal salt marshes on the island of Maui, has been bright pink since at least October 30, officials say, after its salt content surged amid an extreme drought.

Water samples sent to the University of Hawaii suggest that halobacteria is behind the pond’s new magenta hue, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

Halobacteria are single-celled organisms that thrive in very salty water, like the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. The bacterium is considered a so-called extremophile because of its ability to live in such an extreme environment – in this case, one where the water salinity is twice that of seawater, Fish and Wildlife noted.

While Kealia literally means “salt encrustation,” the pond’s salinity has skyrocketed well beyond normal because of Maui’s extreme drought. The entire island is in severe or worse drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. The area where the Kealia Pond refuge is located is in what’s considered an extreme drought – the second-worst on the Drought Monitor’s scale.

The Waikapu Stream, which brings water from the West Maui Mountains down into the Kealia Pond, also flows through the area of extreme drought. Less freshwater input into the pond has driven the salt concentration up and provided a cozy haven for the brightly hued halobacteria.

Around 90% of Maui County, which includes other islands, is in at least severe drought – one that has grown even worse since a deadly wildfire ripped through Lahaina in August.

Scientists are still studying how the climate crisis will affect Hawaii, but overall there is confidence drought will get worse as global temperature increases – even in tropical areas such as this.","['water', 'pond', 'maui', 'kealia', 'drought', 'extreme', 'hawaii', 'salt', 'pink', 'turned', 'worse', 'amid', 'wildlife']","Water at the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge, one of the few coastal salt marshes on the island of Maui, has been bright pink since at least October 30, officials say, after its salt content surged amid an extreme drought.

372,"China blames Canada for ‘malicious, provocative’ moves after close midair intercepts over South China Sea","Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

China has accused Canada of carrying out “malicious and provocative” actions in the South China Sea, after the Canadian Navy said Chinese fighter jets endangered a helicopter in two close intercepts above international waters.

The comments come after CNN revealed last week that a Chinese warplane fired flares in front of a Canadian military helicopter on October 29, an operation that Canadian military officers said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft.

The incident was the second of two “unsafe” encounters the Canadian chopper had on that day with Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy J-11 fighters, which got as close as 100 feet (30 meters) from the helicopter, Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, told CNN in an interview on the warship.

Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair briefed reporters on the incidents later Friday, saying the Chinese jets’ actions were deemed to be “significantly unsafe” and put “the safety of all personnel involved in unnecessary risk.”

Canada said both incidents took place in international waters within the South China Sea.

China’s Defense Ministry hit back on Saturday, accusing Canada of violating Chinese and international laws, jeopardizing China’s sovereignty and security, and conducting “malicious and provocative act with ulterior motives.”

Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesperson for the Chinese Defense Ministry, said Canada’s HMCS Ottawa frigate flew two helicopter sorties with “unknown intentions” toward China’s airspace around the Xisha Islands – a disputed archipelago claimed by China, Vietnam and Taiwan and also known as the Paracel Islands.

“China’s People’s Liberation Army organized naval and air forces to conduct identification, verification in accordance with the law and issued multiple warnings. However, the Canadian helicopter not only refused to respond, but also took provocative actions such as flying at ultra-low altitudes,” Zhang said in a statement posted on the ministry’s website.

“We urge the Canadian side not to ignore the facts, stop exaggerating and hyping up (the incident), and to strictly restrict the actions of its frontline naval and air forces to prevent accidents at sea and in the air,” he added.

Millen, the Canadian air commander, told CNN he was piloting the helicopter on October 29, when Chinese J-11s intercepted it at close range while it flew straight and level at 3,000 feet above the water back toward the Ottawa, a signal to the Chinese that it had no hostile intent.

He said he had to descend to 200 feet – an area where the helicopter can operate but is “very uncomfortable for fast air fighter jets” – to end the “unsafe” encounter with Chinese jets.

The Chinese fighters flew in circles so close that his helicopter experienced turbulence coming off the jets, which posed a danger to the copter, Millen said.

China claims historic jurisdiction over almost the entirety of the vast South China Sea, which is a resource rich and vital international shipping route. Since 2014 Beijing has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants.

In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling and Western powers routinely conduct naval passages through the sea to uphold the claim that it is an international waterway.

The latest incidents are the second risky midair intercept Canada has accused China of conducting last month.

In mid-October, a Chinese fighter jet came within 5 meters (16 feet) of a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance and surveillance plane over the East China Sea.

That incident was recorded by news crews aboard the Canadian aircraft and witnessed by Maj. Gen. Iain Huddleston, the commander of Canada’s 1st Air Division, who was also on the plane.

Huddleston called the intercept “unprofessional” and “very aggressive” in a report from Radio Canada, which was on the plane.

“The Canadian aircraft was subject to multiple close-proximity maneuvers by a PLAAF aircraft that put the safety of all personnel at risk,” Canada’s Defense Ministry said in a statement.

China’s Foreign Ministry said the Canadian plane illegally entered Chinese airspace and accused the Canadian military of sending “warplanes halfway around the world to stir up trouble and make provocations at China’s doorsteps.”","['malicious', 'midair', 'close', 'helicopter', 'sea', 'intercepts', 'canada', 'chinese', 'international', 'china', 'air', 'south', 'moves', 'jets', 'provocative', 'canadian', 'ministry']","Hong Kong CNN —China has accused Canada of carrying out “malicious and provocative” actions in the South China Sea, after the Canadian Navy said Chinese fighter jets endangered a helicopter in two close intercepts above international waters.

373,Caster Semenya says she went through ‘hell’ due to testosterone limits imposed on female athletes,"CNN —

South Africa’s two-time Olympic champion Caster Semenya told CNN that having to take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete internationally was “hell” and had a negative impact on her health.

In her new book, “The Race To Be Myself,’ Semenya describes the damaging impact the medication had on her body and now says she wants to use her platform to stop other women having to endure the same thing.

“I would say it was hell because each and every day you live under stress,” Semenya told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga, speaking about taking the medication.

The runner has been at the forefront of controversy. She has been supported by athletes of world renown like tennis great Martina Navratilova but British runner Lynsey Sharp tearfully said how “difficult” it was for her and others to compete against Semenya.

Sharp broke down in tears after watching Semenya storm away to victory at the Rio Olympics in 2016.

Semenya is hyperandrogenous – meaning she has naturally high levels of testosterone – and is fighting against new rules introduced in 2019 by track and field’s governing body World Athletics (WA) – and previously known as the IAAF – that regulate levels of the hormone in female athletes.

In July this year, Semenya won an appeal which she had submitted to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to end the testosterone limits.

“You are not happy within; you are never happy. It makes you feel sick, nauseous. You have panic attacks. It starts creating a little bit of blood clots in your system,” Semenya says.

“Your stomach is burning. You eat a lot. You can’t sleep. You sweat a lot each and every day.

“It’s like digging a hole that you can never fill up. You know, it’s like you measure a casket and you get in and then you bury yourself. It was not easy. It was a hard time.”

Caster Semenya was one of the most dominant runners in the world during her prime. Cameron Spencer/Getty Images

In a statement to CNN, World Athletics said it stood by its rules and research.

“World Athletics has over a decade of research, directly from DSD athletes in our own sport, that show high testosterone levels do provide an unfair advantage in the female category,” World Athletics said.

“The research also shows that the frequency of DSD individuals in the elite athlete population is around 140 times higher than you will find in the general female population. This is why our guidelines on testosterone thresholds are necessary, reasonable, and proportionate to protect the integrity of the female category and have been upheld by two Courts.

“If we don’t protect the female category, then women and young girls will not choose sport.”

Inconclusive impact on performance

Semenya won the 800m gold medal at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics Games, but the rules introduced by World Athletics in 2019 meant she would need to take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete internationally over distances between 400m and one mile – something she has declined to do. She was unable to defend her 800m crown in Tokyo in 2021 because of the rule changes.

Variations in people’s reproductive anatomy, chromosome patterns or other traits that may not align with typical binary definitions of female or male are what is defined as differences in sex development (DSD).

It is difficult to estimate how many people have DSD traits – many live their entire lives without ever knowing they have one. Scientists estimate as many as one out of every 50 people is born with DSD traits.

Semenya acknowledged the differences in her body but insisted DSD athletes did not have an unfair advantage in the sport.

“I’m born a woman, but I’m a woman with no uterus. I have no fallopian tubes. I don’t go through menstruation,” Semenya said.

“Yes, I’m different, but it doesn’t make me less of a woman.”

“I am here where I am because of dedication, hard work, discipline and all those things,” she added.

“But then is it considered a threat to a man in sport because, when a woman does great, it becomes a problem. But when a man does good, they’re phenomenal.

“But genetically, it’s something that you can say you cannot control it.”

Semenya has been locked in a battle with World Athletics – notably with its president Sebastian Coe – for almost a decade over the issue of testosterone regulation and lost appeals against the ruling in both 2019 and 2020.

The science on the matter is not entirely conclusive.

Retired endocrinologist Peter Sonksen told CNN in 2021 that “there is good evidence to show muscle bulk increases with increasing dosage of testosterone,” but added that the relationship between blood testosterone level and performance remains “complex and controversial.”

New chapter

Semenya, 32, said she felt ready to write a book about her life, but admitted facing questions about her gender at an early age was difficult.

In the book, she said she was 18 when she first faced scrutiny from World Athletics, then known as the IAAF.

Semenya described the moment as “life-changing.”

“You are 18 years of age and then you get asked if you are not woman enough. Your entire childhood you have been a woman, regardless of the differences that you have in your body,” she said.

“But I think for me, what I had to turn around was the humiliation, you know, the injustice and people treating me with no respect.

“I think the importance for me was knowing who I am, my identity and carrying that to represent my country.”

Semenya said she would continue to “advocate for what is right” for women’s sport, proof that one of the most dominant athletes of her time has not turned her back on the sport she loves quite yet.","['female', 'athletes', 'athletics', 'caster', 'dsd', 'testosterone', 'imposed', 'hell', 'world', 'cnn', 'woman', 'sport', 'body', 'went', 'semenya', 'limits']","In July this year, Semenya won an appeal which she had submitted to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to end the testosterone limits.

374,"Exclusive: Chinese jet fired flares close to submarine-hunting helicopter in South China Sea, Canadian Navy says","Aboard HMCS Ottawa CNN —

A Chinese warplane fired flares in front of a Canadian military helicopter over international waters of the South China Sea last Sunday, an operation that Canadian military officers said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft.

“The risk to a helicopter in that instance is the flares moving into the rotor blades or the engines so this was categorized as both unsafe and non-standard, unprofessional,” said Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, the warship from which the Sikorsky Cyclone helicopter was flying.

The incident was the second of two encounters the Ottawa’s helicopter had with Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy J-11 fighter jets over international waters on October 29, which saw the fighters get as close as 100 feet from the helicopter, Millen told CNN in an interview aboard the warship.

He said that Canada and other nations have seen Chinese aircraft get close to fixed-wing aircraft on numerous occasions, but it was rare to see such action taken against a helicopter.

The first incident was over international waters outside of 34 miles from the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the South China Sea. The second was also over international waters outside of 23 miles from the Paracels. The warship was operating in international waters 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of the Paracels at the time.

The Canadian helicopter was searching for a previously detected submarine when the incidents occurred, officers aboard the Ottawa said.

Millen said he was piloting the Canadian helicopter earlier in the day, when Chinese J-11s intercepted it at close range while it flew straight and level at 3,000 feet above the water back toward the Ottawa, a signal to the Chinese that it had no hostile intent.

In that earlier encounter, Millen said the Chinese fighters flew in circles around his helicopter.

“When the intercepting aircraft was closer and closer, at a certain point it became unsafe,” he said.

His helicopter experienced turbulence coming off the Chinese jets, also posing a danger to the copter, Millen said.

“I certainly am not as comfortable as you can be based on the fragility of the rotor system,” he said.

Millen said he ended that encounter by descending to 200 feet, an area where the helicopter can operate but is “very uncomfortable for fast air fighter jets.”

The Canadian air force major said his military’s air crews train on how to respond to such intercepts as occurred on Sunday and will continue to fly over the international waters of the South China Sea.

Asked about the interception at a regular press briefing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”

“We have reiterated many times our firm position on Canadian warplanes conducting reconnaissance near China’s territorial airspace,” he told reporters. “We hope Canada will refrain from its inappropriate behavior to avoid the situation from becoming more complicated.”

CNN has also reached to China’s Defense Ministry for comment.

China claims historic jurisdiction over almost the entirety of the vast South China Sea, and since 2014 has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants. The Paracels, called the Xisha Islands by China, are in the northern part of the South China Sea, east of Da Nang, Vietnam, and south of China’s Hainan Island.

The 1.3-million-square-mile waterway is vital to international trade, with an estimated third of global shipping worth trillions of dollars passing through each year. It’s also home to vast fertile fishing grounds upon which many lives and livelihoods depend.

In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling.

Freedom of navigation



Major western powers frequently conduct passage across the sea in order to assert that the region is international waters, sparking Beijing’s ire.

The Ottawa had been patrolling the waterway since last Monday, at times operating with United States, Australian, Japanese and New Zealand naval vessels and aircraft in a multinational exercise dubbed Noble Caribou. However, it was operating alone when the encounters with the Chinese jets.

The Ottawa and the US Navy destroyer USS Rafael Peralta overnight Wednesday into Thursday local time continued their deployment into the Taiwan Strait, another international waterway and vital shipping channel that has seen tense

encounters between PLA and allied vessels.

Last June, the US Navy reported a close encounter between the destroyer USS Chung-Hoon and a Chinese warship during a Taiwan Strait transit, in which the US warship slowed down to avoid colliding with the Chinese navy vessel that cut in front of it. The Canadian frigate HMCS Montreal was accompanying the US ship at the time, and a news crew aboard it recorded the incident.

Then Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu blamed the US for ratcheting up tensions in the region when questioned by reporters at a defense conference in Singapore.

“They are not here for innocent passage, they are here for provocation,” Li said of US warships.

Li said if the US and other foreign powers did not want confrontation, they should not send their military assets near China.

“Mind your own business,” Li said, adding, “Why did all these incidents happen in areas near China, not in areas near other countries?”

This week’s passage of the allied warships through the strait was uneventful, however, with no contact reported.

Sunday’s incidents come after other reports of unsafe intercepts of allied aircraft in the recent days.

On Tuesday, a PLA fighter jet came within 10 feet of a US Air Force B-52 bomber flying over the South China Sea, the US military said.

And earlier in October, a Chinese fighter jet came within five meters (16 feet) of a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance and surveillance plane over the East China Sea.

That incident was recorded by news crews aboard the Canadian aircraft and witnessed by Maj. Gen. Iain Huddleston, the commander of Canada’s 1st Air Division, who was also on the plane.

Huddleston called the intercept “unprofessional” and “very aggressive” in a report from Radio Canada, which was on the plane.

“The Canadian aircraft was subject to multiple close-proximity manoeuvres by a PLAAF aircraft that put the safety of all personnel at risk,” Canada’s Defense Ministry said in a statement.

China’s Foreign Ministry said the Canadian plane illegally entered Chinese airspace and accused the Canadian military of sending “warplanes halfway around the world to stir up trouble and make provocations at China’s doorsteps.”

In February, in an incident witnessed by a CNN crew, a Chinese fighter jet came within 500 feet of a US Navy reconnaissance plane flying at 21,500 feet about 30 miles from the Paracels.

Earlier this month, the Pentagon’s top official in charge of security in the Indo-Pacific, Ely Ratner, said that the US has seen more instances of “coercive and risky” behavior from Chinese pilots against US aircraft in the last two years over the East and South China Seas than in the entire decade before that.

“Since the fall of 2021, we have seen more than 180 such incidents,” Ratner said. “It’s a centralized and concerted campaign to perform these risky behaviors in order to coerce a change in lawful US operational activity.”","['waters', 'helicopter', 'close', 'sea', 'flares', 'submarinehunting', 'chinese', 'international', 'aircraft', 'fired', 'china', 'south', 'navy', 'jet', 'canadian', 'exclusive']","The first incident was over international waters outside of 34 miles from the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the South China Sea.

376,Images from Gaza show Israeli soldiers detaining dozens of men stripped to underwear,"Jerusalem CNN —

Images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday showed a mass detention by the Israeli military of men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds, and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle.

The exact circumstances and dates of the detentions are unclear, but some of the detainees’ identities were confirmed by colleagues or family members.

Both the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hamas responded Friday to the images.

IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus told CNN the men pictured were “Hamas members and suspect Hamas members.” He said they were “without clothes in order to make sure they’re not carrying explosives.”

Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas’ political office, accused Israel in a statement of “kidnapping, invasive searches and disrobing” what he said was “a group of displaced Palestinian civilians.” He called it a “reprehensible crime” and urged human rights organizations to intervene.

At least some of the men are civilians with no known affiliation to militant groups, according to a CNN interview with one of their relatives and a statement by one of their employers, a news network.

The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor posted an image of one detainment and said in a statement on its website Thursday that “the Israeli army detained and severely abused dozens of Palestinian civilians.”

“Euro-Med Monitor received reports that Israeli forces launched random and arbitrary arrest campaigns against displaced people, including doctors, academics, journalists, and elderly men,” it said.

CNN has geo-located some of the images to Beit Lahia, north of Gaza City.

The Israeli media, without indicating a source, has portrayed the images as the surrender of Hamas members. A journalist asked IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari about the images during a news conference on Thursday, saying, “We’ve seen images of many captives, Hamas terrorists, that the IDF arrested during the ground maneuvering.”

Hagari said that, in fighting Hamas, “those left in the area gradually come out.”

“We investigate and check who has ties to Hamas, and who does not,” he said. “We arrest them all and question them. We will continue dismantling each one of those strongholds until we are done.”

On Friday, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy told CNN that men depicted in images of mass detentions in Gaza were all “suspected terrorists.”

Israeli forces were apprehending military-age men in areas of Gaza where they had been urging evacuation for more than a month, according to Levy, describing these areas as “Hamas strongholds.” Those who were not terrorists would be released, he said.

The men can be seen in the cargo bed of a military vehicle. Obtained by CNN

In an interview with CNN on Friday, Hani Almadhoun, director of philanthropy for the US arm of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA USA) said he knew a dozen people pictured in circulating images, including his brother.

“They’re neither fighters, they’re not surrendering, they’re just civilians who were there with their families trying to survive this,” Almadhoun told CNN’s Pamela Brown.

Almadhoun said the men he knew from his family had since been released, but described the situation as “baffling” to see his brother, a father and a shopkeeper, “dragged” from his home as a suspected Hamas combatant.

“My brother has seizures and they had him naked in the street and they put him on the beach in the winter, naked taking pictures of him, verifying who he is, and then they released him after they roughed him up a little bit,” he said.

“There is a lot of trauma from this for anybody who is watching, especially for my mom who has lost her son,” he said after describing how another brother and his family had recently been killed in an air strike. “You don’t recover from this. This is not just about justice, this feels like more about revenge.”

His family remained in northern Gaza instead of evacuating because they had nowhere to go in the south and had a family member killed in a safe zone, he added.

In a statement Thursday, news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed said that one of its correspondents and several members of his family were among those detained as part of the incident portrayed in the images.

It reported that Diaa Al-Kahlout was arrested by Israeli troops at gunpoint and forced to leave his disabled daughter behind, before he was allegedly stripped and beaten.

“Today, Thursday, the Israeli occupation army arrested the journalist and the director of ‘The New Arab’ office in Gaza, our colleague Diaa Al-Kahlot, from Market Street in Beit Lahia, along with a group of his brothers, relatives, and other civilians,” Al-Araby Al-Jadeed wrote.

“The occupation deliberately forced Gazans to take off their clothes, searched them, and humiliated them when they were arrested before taking them to an unknown destination, according to what the people there told us. Pictures and video clips spread showing soldiers arresting dozens of Gazans using criminal and humiliating method.”

Hussam Kanafani, the Al-Araby Al-Jadeed editor-in-chief, said in the statement that Al-Kahlot and his family were still missing.

“We will make every effort possible, in cooperation with international institutions and organizations concerned with the rights and freedom of journalists in the world, to determine the whereabouts of our colleague Diaa and release him as soon as possible,” Kanafani said.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was concerned by reports of Al-Kahlout’s arrest and called for his release.

“The Israeli army should disclose his location, release him immediately, and take steps to ensure the safety of all journalists covering this war, especially those in Gaza who face imminent harm,” CPJ Middle East and North Africa Program Coordinator Sherif Mansour said in a statement.

377,"Vladimir Putin, Russian president, says he will seek re-election in 2024","CNN —

Vladimir Putin says he will run for president again in Russia’s elections in March 2024, in a move that could see him retain power until at least 2030.

Putin made the announcement Friday after a ceremony at the Kremlin, the official residence of the Russian president.

Putin will bid for his fifth presidential term at the elections, set to take place on March 17, 2024, as he aims to solidify his continuous hold on power as head of state or prime minister for more than two decades.

The upcoming elections will also mark the first time that residents of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, annexed by Russia during the conflict, will participate in the presidential elections.

Russia’s Central Election Commission said it would organize “house-to-house voting” in those four regions over three consecutive days on March 15, 16 and 17.

The international community previously condemned local elections in these regions, organized by Russian-backed officials, as a sham.

Putin became acting prime minister of Russia in August 1999, before unexpectedly being handed the presidency by then-President Boris Yeltsin on New Year’s Eve of that year.

He served two four-year terms as president before stepping aside in 2008, as he was not constitutionally permitted to run for another presidential term. He endorsed Dmitry Medvedev, who replaced him as president, while Putin took the role of prime minister for a second time.

But he regained the presidency in 2012 and has not relinquished his grip on power since. After winning re-election in 2018, Putin then signed a law in 2021 which paved the way for him to run for two more six-year terms.

The changes to the law means that Putin, 71, could potentially extend his rule until 2036, by which time he will be in his mid-80s and his rule will be well into its third decade.

Putin is expected to face no more than token opposition in March. Under his authoritarian rule, opposition politicians have met similar fates: Exile, imprisonment or death in suspicious circumstances.

Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who posed one of the most serious political challenges to Putin during his rule, was sentenced in August to 19 years in prison on extremism charges. Navalny and his supporters claim his arrest was politically motivated, intended to silence his criticism of Putin.

Navalny was immediately detained upon returning to Russia in 2021. He had been taken from Russian to Germany in 2020, after he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok. Navalny arrived comatose at a hospital in Berlin, following a medical evacuation flight from the Siberian city of Omsk. A joint investigation by CNN and the group Bellingcat implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in Navalny’s poisoning.

Russia denies involvement in Navalny’s poisoning. Putin said in December 2020 that if Russian security services had wanted to kill Navalny, they “would have finished” the job.

Putin’s war in Ukraine, initially expected by Russia to last just a few weeks, will likely have entered its second year by the time presidential elections are held in March. While accurately gauging public opinion in Russia is difficult, the war is still thought to command broad support among the public, despite the costs it has placed on Russian society.

The Kremlin tries to keep the Russian population isolated from the worst of the conflict, but Ukraine has repeatedly attempted to bring the war home to Russia, launching its own strikes on cities across the country – including on the Kremlin itself.

Russia has kept the casualty numbers from its war in Ukraine shrouded in secrecy. In September 2022, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said 5,937 troops had been killed in the war. The ministry has not published an update since.

But western intelligence assessments put the toll much higher. Western intelligence assessments put the toll much higher. The United Kingdom defense ministry said in October it is likely that Russia has suffered between 150,000 and 190,000 permanent casualties, meaning killed or permanently wounded, since February 2022.

378,Australia swelters under extreme heat as rare early cyclone barrels toward northern coast,"CNN —

A tropical cyclone has rapidly intensified off the northern coast of Australia as millions across the country endure heat wave conditions that are forecast to stretch into the weekend.

Severe tropical cyclone Jasper strengthened to the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane Friday, with maximum winds of 220 kilometers per hour (138 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.



“Further intensification Friday is possible, and a category 5 system cannot be ruled out,” the country’s meteorology bureau said.

Jasper is the earliest Category 4 tropical cyclone to form in the Coral Sea since records began in 1900, according to CNN research of National Hurricane Center storm tracks.

The storm, which is located 1,195 kilometers (742 miles) northeast of Queensland and moving south at 9 kph (6 mph), could strike the coast near Cairns, a city of 250,000 people, with maximum sustained winds of 140 kph (87 mph) by early Tuesday.

However, forecasters say its projected path could change.

The storm’s arrival is unusually early during El Niño, a climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and generally reduces rainfall along Australia’s east coast.

The system has impacted weather all over the world this year and can particularly influence storm seasons.

Meanwhile, heat warnings are in effect in several states and territories, including New South Wales, home to more than 8 million people.

Temperatures in the NSW capital Sydney are expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) on Saturday, according to Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology, with the heat fueled by strong, dry winds.

Some schools in Sydney were forced to shut Friday and a total fire ban was in place in some parts of NSW, due to the increased risk of bushfires.

A “catastrophic” fire rating was issued in parts of South Australia on Friday, the highest on the scale, which indicates that lives and properties are likely to be lost if a fire starts.

Extreme fire danger ratings were in place in parts of New South Wales and Victoria.

The heat is forecast to weaken somewhat by the end of the weekend into early next week.

Australia is one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of the climate crisis, with frequent heat waves, extreme rainfall and devastating bushfires.

Earlier this year, more than 20 runners in the Sydney Marathon were hospitalized in a heat wave during Australia’s warmest winter since records began in 1910.

Ski resorts, including Perisher, the country’s largest, also closed early due to a lack of snow.

Fears were particularly high as memories of the catastrophic 2020 Black Summer fires – the country’s worst in decades – remain etched in the minds of millions of Australians.

The fires burned 10 million hectares (24.7 million acres), killing dozens of people and destroying more than 3,000 homes.","['storm', 'heat', 'rare', 'barrels', 'early', 'northern', 'cyclone', 'australia', 'sydney', 'mph', 'swelters', 'million', 'extreme', 'coast', 'south', 'parts', 'tropical']","CNN —A tropical cyclone has rapidly intensified off the northern coast of Australia as millions across the country endure heat wave conditions that are forecast to stretch into the weekend.

379,Italy quits Belt and Road plan as Europe rethinks China relations,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

Italy, the only G7 country to join China’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative, will leave the global infrastructure program when its contract expires next year - the latest sign of hardening European attitudes to Beijing and its global ambitions.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Thursday confirmed the widely expected move, a campaign pledge during her run for office last year amid complaints the deal signed with China by a previous government in 2019 had brought few benefits to Italy’s economy.

Meloni stressed however that Rome could maintain good ties with Beijing outside the program, which has expanded China’s global influence while raising concerns it has saddled some countries with unmanageable debt.

“I think that we should … improve our cooperation with China on trade, the economy,” Meloni told reporters, according to Reuters, in her first public comments on the issue after reports Italy had told China of its decision not to extend the pact after it expires in March 2024.

“The tool of the (BRI) … has not produced the results that were expected,” she added.

Italy’s move comes as the European Union has embarked on a campaign to “de-risk” its supply chains from China’s and secure sensitive technologies after the bloc deemed Beijing a “systemic rival” in 2019.

Those frictions were on show Thursday during a summit between EU heads and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing, where the two sides grappled with points of contention from trade to Russia’s war in Ukraine - with little concrete progress made.

China’s Foreign Ministry took a measured tone when asked about the Italian withdrawal during a regular press briefing Thursday, pointing to the “enormous appeal and global influence of Belt and Road cooperation.”

“China firmly opposes attempts to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation or stoke bloc confrontation and division,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, without referring directly to Italy.

‘Wicked’ decision

China has inked agreements with what it says are more than 140 countries for partnership on the program, which has funneled hundreds of billions of dollars into roads, ports, airports and bridges, largely across the Global South over the past decade.

Italy’s decision to join the scheme in 2019 was widely seen at the time as a diplomatic win for Beijing – and drew criticism from Washington and Brussels.

In an interview with newspaper Corriere della Sera this summer, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto branded the 2019 decision as “wicked,” citing growing trade imbalances between the two countries.

China imported $26.9 billion in Italian goods last year, compared with $21.4 billion in 2019. By contrast, Chinese exports to Italy rose to $50.5 billion from $33.5 billion over the same period, according to China’s customs data.

Rome joined the scheme under former China-friendly Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who condemned the withdrawal in an interview posted to his Facebook page, saying it was made for “ideological reasons” and risked “scuppering” potential expansion of Italian exports.

Chinese Ambassador to Italy Jia Guide earlier this year in an interview with Italian news outlet Fanpage suggested a “reckless” decision to withdraw from the pact would have a “negative” impact on cooperation.

Italian leaders have appeared keen to navigate the withdrawal carefully, with Meloni repeatedly suggesting it was possible to have good relations with China outside the Belt and Road plan. She has also previously denied speculation that the United States pressured her to quit the scheme.

EU meeting in Beijing

The news of Rome’s withdrawal came as the delegation of top European Union officials arrived in Beijing for the first in-person EU-China summit in four years.

The meeting was seen by Chinese leaders as a key opportunity to smooth contentious relations with Europe, which Beijing continues to see as a key potential counterweight in its competition with the United States.

“We should not view each other as rivals just because our systems are different, reduce cooperation because competition exists, or engage in confrontation because there are disagreements,” Xi told the visiting leaders, according to China’s official readout.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel pressed Xi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang on the gaping trade deficit between their economies and “unfair competition,” while Li urged the EU to be “prudent” in its use of “restrictive” economic policies.

Though the summit appeared to do little to resolve key issues, Von der Leyen said it saw both sides agree “that it is in our joint interest to have balanced trade relations.”

The EU side would be looking for “concrete progress following these discussions,” the bloc said in a statement after the meeting.","['chinas', 'belt', 'italian', 'europe', 'relations', 'road', 'european', 'italy', 'trade', 'china', 'withdrawal', 'global', 'beijing', 'plan', 'quits', 'rethinks']","Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

380,UPenn President Liz Magill under fire over her testimony on antisemitism: ‘An utter disgrace’,"New York CNN —

The growing chorus of donors, politicians, business leaders and other prominent figures calling for the immediate ouster of University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill has reached a crescendo after her disastrous testimony at a House hearing earlier this week.

During Tuesday’s House hearing, Magill, along with the presidents of Harvard and MIT, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

Magill had already been under fire prior to Tuesday’s hearing after multiple incidents of antisemitism on campus in recent months – and what critics have said was a tepid response to those incidents.

After the fallout from Tuesday’s hearing, Magill attempted to clarify her message on Wednesday, posting a video on X in which she said she should have focused on the “irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate.”

Magill said Wednesday that Penn’s policies “need to be clarified and evaluated,” adding that in her view: “It would be harassment or intimidation.”

Harvard University president Claudine Gay has apologized for her comments in an interview with the student newspaper Thursday.

“I am sorry,” Gay said to The Harvard Crimson. “Words matter.”

But Magill has not apologized. Penn’s stakeholders remain unsatisfied. Here is who is calling for Magill to resign:

A bipartisan group of more than 70 members of Congress on Friday sent a letter to board members of Harvard, MIT and Penn demanding Magill and her counterparts at the other two universities be dismissed.

“Given this moment of crisis, we demand that your boards immediately remove each of these presidents from their positions and that you provide an actionable plan to ensure that Jewish and Israeli students, teachers, and faculty are safe on your campuses,” the lawmakers wrote.

“The university presidents’ responses to questions aimed at addressing the growing trend of antisemitism on college and university campuses were abhorrent,” the lawmakers added.

Former US Ambassador Jon Huntsman Thursday night called on Penn’s board of trustees to remove Magill.

“Let’s make this great institution shine once again,” Huntsman said in a statement shared exclusively with CNN on Thursday evening. “We are anchored to the past until the trustees step up and completely cut ties with current leadership. Full stop.”

Huntsman, the former governor of Utah, was a 1987 graduate and former UPenn trustee. In October, he blasted Penn’s response to antisemitism on campus and promised to halt his family’s donations to the university. The Huntsman family has been such prominent supporters of UPenn that the Huntsman name is on the main Wharton School building.

Now, Huntsman is going further, calling for a complete leadership change.

“At this point it’s not even debatable,” Huntsman said. “Just a simple IQ test.”

Stone Ridge Holdings CEO Ross Stevens, a major donor to Penn, sent a letter on Thursday to Penn threatening to take steps that would cost the Ivy League school approximately $100 million if Magill stays on as president.

Stevens, a Penn alum and CEO of Stone Ridge Holdings, argues he has clear grounds to rescind $100 million worth of shares in his company that are currently held by Penn. He specifically cites Magill’s disastrous testimony before Congress earlier this week.

“Absent a change in leadership and values at Penn in the very near future, I plan to rescind Penn’s Stone Ridge shares to help prevent any further reputational and other damage to Stone Ridge as a result of our relationship with Penn and Liz Magill,” Stevens said in a note to his employees on Thursday obtained by CNN.

The Wharton Board of Advisors, comprised of a powerful group of business leaders, including NFL owner Josh Harris, former Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky, Related Companies CEO Jeff Blau, Blackstone exec David Blitzer and BET CEO Scott Mills, has called for Magill’s immediate ouster.

“As a result of the University leadership’s stated beliefs and collective failure to act, our Board respectfully suggests to you and the Board of Trustees that the University requires new leadership with immediate effect,” the Wharton Board of Advisors wrote in a letter sent directly to Magill.

The letter, which appears to have been sent Wednesday, specifically cites Magill’s testimony.

Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, called the testimony “catastrophic and clarifying” and said Magill’s attempt to clean-up her testimony “looked like a hostage video, like she was speaking under duress.”

“I understand why the governor of Pennsylvania and so many of the trustees don’t have confidence in her. I don’t have confidence anymore that Penn is capable, under this leadership, of getting it right,” Greenblatt told CNN’s Kate Bolduan, adding that he has spoken with Magill.

Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Thursday said she agrees with calls for the presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania to resign, arguing they are “failing in the worst way.”

“Their statements were abhorrent,” Gillibrand told Fox News, referring to Tuesday’s hearing in the House. “Trying to contextualize what constitutes harassment? Jewish students are terrified on these campuses.”","['huntsman', 'disgrace', 'penns', 'liz', 'ceo', 'board', 'hearing', 'upenn', 'university', 'utter', 'penn', 'president', 'tuesdays', 'testimony', 'leadership', 'antisemitism', 'magill']","During Tuesday’s House hearing, Magill, along with the presidents of Harvard and MIT, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment.

381,Diphtheria: West Africa battles worst outbreak in recent times,"CNN —

In Nigeria’s northern state of Kano, doctors and health workers are grappling with one of the worst diphtheria outbreaks in recent times.

Cases have been reported in the country since May of last year, but in the past few months, the outbreak has spread at an alarming rate, health officials say. Local, federal, and international bodies have struggled to contain the bacterial disease, with 17,000 suspected cases in Nigeria so far.

Worryingly, the outbreak has now spread to other West African countries such as Niger and Guinea and Medecins San Frontieres (MSF) says these nations are currently facing some of the most severe outbreaks of this vaccine-preventable disease ever documented on the continent.

However, the epicenter remains Kano, MSF health workers told CNN. So far, they have confirmed 9,310 cases and 368 deaths this year.

At its peak, MSF in Kano reported up to 700 cases a week. This rate dropped in September, but cases are slowly starting to rise again, currently at 500 weekly.

A bacterial disease

Diphtheria is a bacterial disease that creates a toxin that kills tissues and attacks cells in the respiratory system, making it hard for patients to breathe and swallow. If the toxin enters the bloodstream, it can damage the nervous system, and cause heart and kidney damage or paralysis, even after recovery, according to an MSF explainer on the disease.

Murjanatu Muhammad, a 30-year-old from Kano, has seen all of her children, 10-year-old Mohammed, eight-year-old Fatima, and twins Jamila and Husseina, aged five, admitted to hospital with diphtheria.

“You can imagine if we didn’t bring these children early enough, we don’t know what would have happened to them,” she told CNN.

For another mother, Firdausa Salisu, her son Auwal Nura has been sick since he was born four years ago and was receiving treatment from a traditional healer who advised against vaccines, his mother said.

“The traditional medicine man that was treating him advised that he should not be vaccinated at the time. By the time he recovered and I wanted him to be vaccinated, I was told he was past the age of receiving the vaccines.”

High mortality in children

Thousands of children like Auwal have experienced the alarming range of symptoms caused by diphtheria, says Dr. Hashim Juma.

Dr. Juma, with over 20 years of experience in the field, is currently based in Kano working as the emergency medical coordinator for MSF.

“This is very serious. Patients come in vomiting blood, paralysis in the legs… there is high mortality, particularly with children.” Dr. Hashim Juma, Medecins Sans Frontieres.

“Never have I ever faced this outbreak, in terms of the number of people infected, the mortality, and the complications as well,” he told CNN via a phone call from Kano.

“There are many diseases with complications, but this is very serious. Patients come in vomiting blood, paralysis in the legs… there is high mortality, particularly with children.”

Medical workers have been struggling to treat patients effectively, partly due to a lack of diphtheria anti-toxins (DAT).

So far, MSF says it has only been able to provide 5,000 DAT doses to patients.

With each severe case requiring eight to 10 vials each, this remains far from enough to support those who need it. Without treatment, patients face a roughly 50% chance of death, which reduces to a 5% chance if treated, Dr. Dagemlidet Tesfaye Worku, emergency medical program manager for West and Central Africa at MSF told CNN.

DAT doses and antibiotics are particularly hard to come by due to the lack of production, as well as the cost and time needed to manufacture.

A vial of diphtheria anti-toxin is prepared by a doctor at the treatment center in Kano Georg Gassauer/Medecin San Frontieres

Dr. Dagemlidet says that only three companies produce these doses, two of whom are approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).

He added that manufacturers need four weeks to make one batch of 1,500 DAT doses, and treating patients could cost up to 350 Euros ($370) from DAT alone. He believes this needs to change as soon as possible.

“In the short term, we need to improve production capacity of anti-toxins. Long term, we need to invest in research and development,” Dr. Dagemlidet says.

“It’s a global health crisis… in our globalized world, an outbreak can happen here, or in an urban area somewhere else. Global health security is so important.”

Vaccine mistrust

Vaccination has also played a crucial role in this ongoing outbreak. Whilst some vaccine uptake has helped prevent infections, there are a number of barriers from increasing uptake.

As of November, only 30% of patients in Kano had full vaccine protection, according to MSF. This rate is at its lowest in the northwestern state of Sokoto at just 6%. In response, WHO and UNICEF have started a vaccination campaign across 14 states in Nigeria.

Dr. Juma explains that in Kano there is mistrust and lack of awareness surrounding vaccines. He says: “There is a vaccine hesitancy here. People have had a bad experience with the side effects before. During our first intervention, we could see people were not highly welcoming to the vaccine team.”

The lack of vaccination coverage also applies to the rest of West Africa, with 65% of diphtheria patients having never received a single vaccine dose.

In late November, WHO published an updated explainer on diphtheria, emphasizing the importance of high vaccine uptake to tackle the outbreak. The organization recommends six vaccine doses to babies at six weeks old to provide long-term protection.

GAVI, a vaccine alliance programme, also announced on December 4 that eligible countries can now apply to implement diphtheria vaccines into their health programs.

As the outbreak has escalated since July, Dr. Juma has seen vaccine uptake improve. In order to contain this surge of diphtheria, and help prevent future outbreaks too, this trend must continue.

With the disease now present in neighboring Niger, there is concern that once again the population is not adequately equipped. Dr. Juma says that there is little to no vaccination coverage there, a great concern considering the high level of movement between Kano and Niger.

In order to address the outbreak, the message is clear. Vaccination must improve. Dr. Juma says: “We stress the need to make the routine vaccination system stronger and stronger… then you can control the outbreak.”

Lessons have also been learned regarding doses of antitoxins and antibiotics, explains Dr. Dagemlidet. He says: “We need to have at least a minimum quantity of anti-toxins in each country, so when the first cases happen, adequate resources are available to help local areas.

“The best way of responding to emergencies is anticipation and prevention.”","['juma', 'outbreak', 'worst', 'patients', 'recent', 'vaccine', 'diphtheria', 'kano', 'africa', 'msf', 'dr', 'health', 'battles', 'need', 'west', 'times']","CNN —In Nigeria’s northern state of Kano, doctors and health workers are grappling with one of the worst diphtheria outbreaks in recent times.

382,"Live updates: Israel-Hamas war, US vetoes UN resolution calling for Gaza ceasefire","Images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday showed a mass detention by the Israeli military of men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle. Obtained by CNN

The Israeli military is apprehending military-aged men in northern Gaza to “work out who the terrorists are,” the Israeli Government spokesperson told CNN on Friday.

Eylon Levy was responding to questioning from CNN’s Brianna Keilar about images from Gaza circulating on social media Thursday, which showed men who were made to strip to their underwear, kneel on the street, wear blindfolds, and pack into the cargo bed of a military vehicle.

“When we find military-aged men in areas that we have been urging an evacuation of for over a month – because these are Hamas strongholds where we have seen intense urban fighting – we need to apprehend those people, work out who the terrorists are,” Levy said.

Those who are determined not to be “terrorists” will be released, he added.

At least some of the men detained as part of the operation depicted in the social media images were civilians with no known affiliation to militant groups, according to a conversation CNN had with one of their relatives and a statement by one of their employers, a news network.

The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said Friday that dozens of suspects arrested by Israel in Gaza had been taken to Israeli territory for questioning.

“The people we’re seeing in these images are all suspected terrorists,” Levy said.

“We wish that all Hamas fighters were wearing uniforms that clearly said Hamas on their helmets, because that would make them easier to identify them. But when Hamas dresses up as civilians, and fights within civilian areas, they make it very difficult to find them.”

Some context: The Israeli military for weeks told Gazans to leave northern Gaza, and head south. Now that the Israeli military has invaded southern Gaza, it has told Gazans to head for a small strip of land in southwestern Gaza, along the Mediterranean coast.

But the main UN agency working in the Palestinian territories, UNRWA, says there is no such thing as a “safe zone” in Gaza. “The entire Gaza Strip has become one of the most dangerous places in the world,” it said in a statement. “There is nowhere to go as shelters, including UNRWA, are overflowing.”

Over 1.9 million Gazans, or 85% of the population are internally displaced, according to The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.","['calling', 'updates', 'live', 'israelhamas', 'israeli', 'men', 'terrorists', 'hamas', 'ceasefire', 'military', 'images', 'war', 'resolution', 'gaza', 'told', 'strip', 'vetoes', 'social']","Obtained by CNNThe Israeli military is apprehending military-aged men in northern Gaza to “work out who the terrorists are,” the Israeli Government spokesperson told CNN on Friday.

383,US State Department asks Congress to approve sales of tank munitions to Israel,"CNN —

The US State Department has asked Congress to approve a sale of tens of thousands of munitions for Israeli tanks, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN.

The request, which the source said was received within the last week and is being reviewed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is for 45,000 shells for Israeli Merkava tanks, the source said. The source added that the committees are under “pressure” from the State Department to approve the request quickly amid Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.

The request comes as the US is under growing domestic and international pressure to support a ceasefire in Gaza, and place conditions on some of the weapons it is providing to Israel.

“As a matter of policy, we do not confirm or comment on proposed defense transfers or sales until they have been formally notified to Congress,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN when asked about the request.

Reuters first reported the request.

In early November, the State Department formally notified congressional leaders that it would be transferring $320 million worth of precision-guided bomb equipment to Israel, CNN previously reported.

Israel has received 200 cargo planes of military equipment from “several countries” since the Hamas terror attack on October 7, including ammunition, armored vehicles, and weapons, according to the Israeli Ministry of Defense.

The Israeli ministry said more than 10,000 tons of military equipment have been delivered since the start of the war.

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense said the aid had come from “several countries,” but declined to say what other countries had sent aid or how much of it had come from the United States.

The shipments of US military aid began soon after the war began. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was in Israel on October 13 as a C-17 cargo plane landed with security assistance to Israel.

“There’s a lot more that follows this,” Austin said at the time.

Unlike security assistance to Ukraine where the US details types of weapons and capabilities, the shipments to Israel have been far more discrete, with the Defense Department rarely acknowledging or announcing what types of weapons or equipment it is sending.

In late-October, a senior defense official said the US was expediting the delivery of precision-guided joint direct attack munitions (JDAMs) to Israel, which turn unguided bombs into smart weapons. The US has also expedited the delivery of Iron Dome interceptor missiles for Israel’s primary aerial defense system.

The use of US weapons in Israel’s ongoing war has drawn increased scrutiny following an Amnesty International report this week which claimed that US-made JDAMs were used in two strikes in October which killed 43 civilians. The human rights organization said it “did not find any indication that there were any military objectives at the sites,” a conclusion the Israeli military rejected as “flawed, biased and premature.”

The US State Department and the Defense Department both said they are reviewing Amnesty International’s report.

“We have made clear in our discussions with Israeli leaders that we are deeply concerned about the protection of civilians in this conflict,” State Department spokesman Matt Miller said Wednesday. “We expect Israel to only target legitimate targets and to adhere to the laws of armed conflict.”

384,"Israeli tank fire killed Reuters journalist in October attack, CNN analysis suggests","CNN —

Israeli tank fire killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and injured six other international journalists in a double strike in southern Lebanon on October 13, forensic analysis by CNN suggests, confirming reports by two news organizations and two human rights groups.

On Thursday, Reuters, AFP, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch released investigations into the circumstances of the deadly strike. AFP and HRW claimed the strike was a “deliberate,” targeted attack by Israel on the journalists. In a statement to Reuters, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Richard Hecht said: “We don’t target journalists.” He did not provide further comment, the news agency reported.

The Israel Defense Forces on Friday said that the October incident in which a Reuters journalist was killed is still “under review.”

AFP photographer Christina Assi had her leg amputated and remains in the hospital as a result of the strike, according to AFP.

Eylon Levy, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, said Thursday that he was “not familiar” with the new reports. “The guiding principle in Israel’s campaign against Hamas is we uphold the principles of international law regarding proportionality, necessity, distinction,” he said. “We target Hamas, we do not target civilians.”

CNN’s forensic analysis of multiple videos, including a live AFP video feed from the time and place of the attack, has determined that the two strikes – 37 seconds apart – that hit the journalists was a supersonic event that came from the direction of Israel.

Israel and Hezbollah were engaged in intense crossfire across the Lebanon-Israel border at the time.

CNN has also seen a photo from the scene of the attack showing the tail fin of a 120 mm tank shell. The photo was verified by a source familiar with the investigation.

Neither the Lebanese army nor the Iran-backed Hezbollah are known to have such ammunition in their arsenal.

“That is a 120mm high explosive tank shell. Very clearly high explosive and not a different type of shell,” said Marc Garlasco, a former defense intelligence analyst and UN war crimes investigator, who saw the photo obtained by CNN as well as video of the aftermath of the attack. “(Aftermath video is) very indicative of a direct fire munition and matches with the 120 fragments.”

“The shooter should have seen the journalists from the tank,” he added.

British weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith said the photograph of the remnants of the shell clearly showed an “expended tank round.”

“Two projectiles hit the area of the media crews and from the damage to the wall, the location where Issam’s body ended up and from an analysis of the second crater, I believe the shots came from the area of the high ground just over the border,” said Cobb-Smith, referring to a foot-high wall seen in aftermath video near Abdallah’s body. Cobb-Smith said his analysis of the damage left by the projectile suggested that the attack came from a southeasterly direction.

CNN also consulted with audio expert Robert Maher, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University.

Maher determined that the attack was likely a “supersonic event” due to the absence of an “approaching whoosh or whine, as you might see with artillery fire.”

Cobb-Smith’s theory that the shells travelled from the southeast would be consistent of the findings of the investigations released Thursday.

Hours after the attack on October 13, CNN reported that the journalists attacked were wearing clearly labelled press flak jackets. It also reported that an Israeli Apache helicopter was seen over the site of the attack around the time of the attack, according to a Lebanese security source, which would have given Israeli forces added visibility over the journalists.

Israeli surveillance towers are seen in video of the attack, raising further doubt that Israel had not realized the tank crew was attacking journalists.

‘Under review’

In its statement Friday, the IDF said, “On October 13, 2023, the terrorist organization Hezbollah launched an attack on multiple targets within Israeli territory along the Lebanese border,” the IDF said in a statement. “One incident involved the firing of an anti-tank missile, which struck the border fence near the village Hanita.”

CNN reported that exchange of fire at the time of the incident.

“Following the launch of the anti-tank missile, concerns arose over the potential infiltration of terrorists into Israeli territory. In response, the IDF used artillery and tank fire to prevent the infiltration. The IDF is aware of the claim that journalists who were in the area were killed,” the statement continued.

“The area is an active combat zone, where active fire takes place and being in this area is dangerous. The incident is currently under review,” the IDF said.

IDF spokesperson Richard Hecht on October 14 called Abdallah’s death “a tragic thing,” without naming him directly or acknowledging Israel’s involvement. The same day, the IDF said: “A report was received that during the incident, journalists were injured in the area. The incident is under review.”

Speaking Thursday in Washington, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Abdallah’s death should be investigated. Blinken said it was his understanding that Israel had begun such an investigation and stressed the importance of seeing it through.

A Pentagon spokeswoman said earlier that the agency had not conducted its own assessment of Abdallah’s death but it continued to urge Israel to protect innocent civilians, including members of the press.

Al Jazeera has accused Israel’s military of “deliberately targeting the journalists to silence the media,” saying the attacks are a part of “a pattern of ‘repeated atrocities’ against journalists.”

The Committee to Protect Journalists also said the results of the investigations by Reuters, AFP, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch were in alignment with its own findings that show a “pattern of lethal force” by the Israeli military against journalists over the past 22 years.

The press freedoms group had documented at least 20 journalist killings by the IDF since 2001, it said in a report released May 2023. “The vast majority – 18 – were Palestinian. No one has ever been charged or held accountable for these deaths,” the report said.

‘Deliberate and targeted’

Amnesty International’s investigation did not find “any indication that there were any fighters or military objectives at the site of the strikes.”

“Israeli forces had observation towers, ground elements, and air assets deployed to closely monitor the border. All of this should have provided sufficient information to Israeli forces that these were journalists and civilians and not a military target,” Amnesty said in its report.

“Our investigation into the incident uncovers chilling evidence pointing to an attack on a group of international journalists who were carrying out their work by reporting on hostilities. Direct attacks on civilians and indiscriminate attacks are absolutely prohibited by international humanitarian law and can amount to war crimes,” said Aya Majzoub, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.

“The strikes were deliberate and targeted,” AFP said in its report. AFP global news director Phil Chetwynd said in the report, “AFP has been very clear that we will take all judicial avenues that we deem relevant and possible to ensure that we can get justice for Christina and Issam.”

Dylan Collins, a journalist with AFP who survived the attack, told CNN it was “hard not to see it as a deliberate strike.”

Collins, AFP’s Lebanon/Syria video coordinator, recounted what started as a “pretty quiet day,” describing how teams of Reuters and AFP journalists, all wearing flak jackets, helmets with press written across them, moved toward a plume of smoke after hearing “loud bangs” along the Lebanon-Israel border.

“The Israelis had drones in the air the entire time. And I imagine you know with their state-of-the-art surveillance capabilities, they could see our faces, they probably knew which channels we were working for… At around 6:02 that evening, we were struck directly,” Collins added.

“It was two strikes 37 seconds apart, almost in the same exact location on a group of journalists, seven journalists all wearing press vests and helmets,” Collins said.

The AFP journalist paid tribute to Abdallah, describing him as the “beating heart of the press scene” in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

Speaking of AFP colleague Assi, who sustained “devastating” injuries from the strikes, Collins said, “she’s bled more than any human should bleed.”","['israeli', 'video', 'analysis', 'international', 'idf', 'israel', 'suggests', 'tank', 'cnn', 'journalist', 'attack', 'journalists', 'afp', 'incident', 'killed']","CNN —Israeli tank fire killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and injured six other international journalists in a double strike in southern Lebanon on October 13, forensic analysis by CNN suggests, confirming reports by two news organizations and two human rights groups.

385,Al-Nasr hospital: Infants found dead and decomposing in evacuated Gaza ICU. Here’s what we know,"Editor’s Note: The following story includes graphic material. Audience discretion is advised.

CNN —

The scene inside the Al-Nasr hospital ICU ward is chilling. The tiny bodies of babies, several still attached to wires and tubes that were meant to keep them alive, decomposing in their hospital beds. Milk bottles and spare diapers still next to them on the sheets.

The video inside the hospital was filmed on November 27 by Mohamed Baalousha, a Gaza reporter for UAE-based news outlet Al Mashhad. He shared an unblurred version with CNN, which shows the remains of at least four infants.

Three of them appear to be still connected to hospital machines. The bodies of the babies appear to be darkening and disintegrating from decay, with little more than skeletons left in some of the beds. Flies and maggots are visibly crawling across the skin of one child.

The circumstances around one of the most horrifying videos to emerge from the war in Gaza remain unclear, but after days of piecing together available information, using interviews, published statements and video, a chaotic scene can been painted of hospital staff trying to protect their most vulnerable patients, caught in the middle of a raging battle – waiting for help that never arrived.

Here is what CNN found

CNN geolocated the video to Al-Nasr hospital in northern Gaza. This area has been largely unreachable to journalists in recent weeks due to the intensity of fighting but during the seven-day truce Baalousha says he was able to access the hospital to film what was left there.

From early November, the Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi children’s hospitals, which form part of the same complex, had become the frontline of fighting between Israeli and Hamas forces.

In public statements and interviews, several medical staff and health officials from Al-Nasr said they had to hurriedly evacuate the hospital on November 10, under the direction of Israeli forces.

Medical staff described having to leave young children behind in the ICU because they had no means to safely move them.

A doctor associated with the hospital, who did not want to be named, told CNN that two of the children – a two-year-old and a nine-month-old baby – had died shortly before the evacuation but that three children were left alive still connected to respirators. One of those left alive was two months old. Several of the infants on the ICU had been suffering from genetic disorders, according to the doctor.

The condition of those left behind alive – both at the time the fighting reached the hospital and when the evacuation took place – remains unclear.

In a video on November 9, the head of Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi pediatric hospitals, Dr. Mustafa al-Kahlout, said Al-Nasr hospital had been “struck twice” sustaining “a lot of damage.”

Kahlout warned oxygen to the ICU “was cut off” and reported at least one patient had died as a result, with others facing the risk of death.

It’s unclear whether oxygen cylinders, seen next to some of the beds in the video from the hospital, were functioning or whether supplies had run out.

“The situation is really bad, we are surrounded… ambulances cannot reach the hospital, and ambulances that tried to reach Al-Nasr were targeted,” Kahlout said, calling on international organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to intervene and save the medical staff and patients who remained in the ICU.

Video shared on social media on November 9, which CNN verified, was filmed from inside Al-Nasr hospital and appears to show the aftermath of the building being hit.

Another from November 10 showed an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tank outside Al-Nasr, indicating the IDF was operating in the area. Another video from the same date showed civilians holding up makeshift white flags attempting to flee the hospital amid gunfire, then being forced to run back inside. It is not possible to tell from the video who is shooting.

Satellite imagery reviewed by CNN from November 11 shows large craters around the hospital complex, indicating the area had been under bombardment, making evacuation difficult.

But, in an audio recording of a conversation between a senior official at Al-Rantisi hospital and an officer from COGAT, which coordinates the Israeli government’s activities in the Palestinian territories and Gaza, it appears Israeli forces instructed hospital patients and staff to evacuate.

In the recording, released by the IDF on November 11, the Israeli officer assures the hospital official that ambulances will be arranged.

The hospital official tells the COGAT officer that ambulances cannot reach the hospital, and the officer replies: “I’ll arrange coordination with the primary aid center. Don’t worry, I’m near the army, it will be okay.”

“Will the ambulances take the patients and the medical staff?” the hospital official asks.

“No problem,” the COGAT officer responds, in the recording.

The hospital official then confirms that the COGAT officer is aware that people will be evacuating both Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi hospitals, and the COGAT officer says “yes, yes.”

But hospital officials say the ambulances never arrived.

“Many of the patients were carried out by their families, ambulances couldn’t reach the hospital,” Kahlout said in a news conference on November 14, following the evacuation.

Three children were left in the ICU attached to hospital machines but without oxygen, Kahlout said.

In an audio recording from November 10 released by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) a nurse who the organization said was volunteering in a personal capacity, said the hospital had been shelled, hitting multiple floors, water tanks, and electricity and oxygen stations.

The nurse – who CNN is not identifying for security reasons – said Al-Nasr staff were given 30 minutes to evacuate by the IDF, adding no ambulances were able to reach the hospital.

“We walked out a little bit there was shooting around us,” he said in the recording. Then he said someone from the IDF told him “I’ll give you safe passage, you have from 1130am until 12 noon.”

“So, we walked out with our hands up in the air carrying white flags and carrying families and children,” the nurse said in the recording.

He said he managed to carry one baby with him as he escaped and handed it to an ambulance headed for the Al-Shifa hospital. But four children were left behind in the ICU according to the nurse, in a discrepancy from the number given by Kahlout.

“To leave my patient dying in front of my eyes is the hardest thing I have ever experienced, it’s indescribable, they broke our hearts, we couldn’t help them, we couldn’t take them, we barely left ourselves with our children, we are civilians, we are a medical crew, we are displaced civilians,” he said in the recording.

Over the past week, CNN has tried to speak to medical staff and hospital officials from Al-Nasr, but all have either said they are too afraid to speak or cannot be reached.

The director of Gaza’s hospitals at the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health, Dr. Mohammad Zaqout, told CNN that people in the hospital were forced to leave by the IDF.

“We were forced to leave them behind to die because we didn’t have a safe medical evacuation… we informed them that these children were on beds and couldn’t be evacuated. We held other children in our arms while being forced to evacuate,” Zaqout said.

The IDF has strongly denied responsibility for the deaths of the children in Al-Nasr ICU. “Given that the IDF did not operate inside the Al-Nasr hospital, these allegations are not only false but also a perverse exploitation of innocent lives, used as tools to spread dangerous misinformation,” the IDF said in a statement to CNN.

Asked repeatedly by CNN why it hadn’t provided ambulances for the evacuation, as the COGAT officer had promised in the recorded conversation with the hospital official, and if they were aware of the presence of children left in the ICU, as Zaqout alleged, the IDF did not directly respond.

During an online Q&A for journalists Saturday, IDF spokesman Doron Spielman dismissed the story as merely a “rumor.”

“There were no premature babies that decomposed because of the IDF. There were probably no babies that decomposed whatsoever,” Spielman said. “But Hamas is in charge of Nasr hospital, we are not occupying Nasr hospital.”

Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals as command centers and even as places to hold hostages.

Zaqout denies the allegation and has repeatedly called for “neutral entities, human rights organizations, and media outlets to enter the hospitals and verify for themselves that they are used solely for civilian and humanitarian purposes.”

CNN cannot independently confirm what state the children were in when they were left at the hospital. But Stefan Schmitt, a forensic scientist at Florida International University reviewed the video for CNN and said the level of decomposition of the infants was advanced.

Schmitt said he believed the room had not been disturbed since the children were left. “Those remains decomposed in situ, meaning they decomposed there on those beds,” he said. “You can see that from the bodily fluids that have leaked out over the time of decomposition.”

Schmitt also said one of the corpses appeared to be wrapped in fabric, possibly a shroud, noting there was no medical equipment attached to the body, suggesting the body may already have been dead or severely injured. The room appeared to have been abandoned in a hurry, Schmitt continued, noting the infant car seat and what appears to be a bag packed for one of the children next to its bed.

A statement from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health issued in response to the video of the babies’ remains said Al-Nasr nursing staff were ordered to leave by the IDF, who told them the ICRC was coming to evacuate the patients.

“Instead, their decomposed bodies were found in their beds,” reads the statement. “These babies drew their last breaths alone and died alone.”

The ICRC told CNN it received “several requests” for evacuation from hospitals in the north of Gaza, but due to the “security situation” it was “not involved in any operations or evacuations, nor did teams commit to doing so.” The ICRC added the footage of the deceased children was an “unspeakable tragedy.”

386,US officials discuss post-war Gaza governance plans with Palestinian Authority and Arab nations,"Washington CNN —

US officials are discussing post-war Gaza governance plans with the Palestinian Authority along with regional US allies – making it a key focus as they try to look beyond the immediate conflict.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Friday afternoon with a delegation of Arab counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority, where the topic of Gaza after the Israeli offensive was expected to be a main point of discussion.

Shortly before the meeting began, the US vetoed a UN resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

A draft version of the resolution, presented by the United Arab Emirates, had called for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,” as well as “the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages” and “ensuring humanitarian access,” according to a draft copy.

The US was the lone veto. The UK abstained because the resolution did not condemn the October 7 Hamas attack.

When the war is over, US officials have said they ultimately envision both Gaza and the West Bank being ruled by a unified government led by a “revitalized” Palestinian Authority.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who initially rebuffed the idea of the PA ruling Gaza on the heels of the Israeli offensive, has shifted his position. Still, many questions remain about the immediate “day after” for Gaza once the war ends. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Wednesday that the US understands that there will be “some kind of transition period” in which Israeli forces remain in Gaza after the end of combat operations, but that cannot be permanent.

A Western diplomat told CNN that in past conversations the Arab delegation has made clear that they are not eager to be involved with an international force to provide security in Gaza after the war. The ministers have also said that if the world wants Arab states to play a role in reconstruction and support of the PA, there must be a path towards a Palestinian state.

At a press conference in Washington, DC, Friday, the delegation underscored that they were not willing to discuss the “day after” solely in the context of Gaza, but rather in the context of a Palestinian state.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi suggested on CNN they would not play a role in an international peacekeeping force, and condemned Israel’s offensive.

“All of us are losing our credibility,” he told Jim Sciutto on “CNN Newsroom” on Max.

“We are losing credibility in front of our people because our own people are looking at us and saying, ‘Okay, you’re demanding that Israel stop. It’s not. The whole international community has failed to act in any meaningful manner to stop the massacre,’” he said. “So. Everybody’s losing credibility. Moderation is losing credibility. The camp of peace is losing credibility. So that is a danger with which we we’re going to have to reckon at some point or the other.”

The delegation reiterated their call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and cast aspersions on members of the international community – like the US – for failing to advocate for one.

A senior administration official said that privately there is some consternation within the administration over the US’ Arab allies’ reluctance to play any role in a post-war international peacekeeping force, since they have been among the loudest in condemning Israel’s assault on Gaza. One Arab ambassador told CNN that their country would “absolutely not” place any of its own forces in Gaza after the war. Part of that is because the Arab states do not want to be seen as subjugating the Palestinians, the ambassador explained.

The Biden administration has consistently advocated for a two-state solution. Last month, Blinken laid out the administration’s terms for “durable peace and security” in Gaza after the war, which include no Israeli re-occupation and no reduction in territory. As such, the US is opposed to the establishment of an Israeli security buffer zone within Gaza after the war.

Vice President Kamala Harris also raised post-conflict Gaza in multiple meetings and calls with Arab leaders last weekend when in Dubai, telling reporters that she shared what expectations the US will have with regard to post-conflict planning.

“Specifically, I proposed three areas of focus,” Harris said, citing reconstruction of infrastructure in Gaza, reinforcing Palestinian Authority security and revitalizing PA governance. Harris also reiterated that a two-state solution is the best path forward.

Blinken met with Abbas in Ramallah last week. Harris’ national security adviser, Phil Gordon, held additional meetings in the West Bank this week.

“He underscored our commitment to the future establishment of a Palestinian state and made clear that the Palestinian people must have a hopeful political horizon. To that end, Dr. Gordon discussed the revitalization of the Palestinian Authority,” according to a White House readout.

It’s an extension of what US national security officials have telegraphed as it relates to Gaza and the PA.

“Leadership choices – these are, of course, up to the Palestinian people and Palestinians themselves. But there are a number of things that we think would be critical to making sure that, again, the Palestinian Authority can be effective in helping to advance the aspirations and the needs of its people,” Blinken said last week.

Deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said last month that the PA will “have to be part” of any future governing solution in both the West Bank and Gaza following the current hostilities – a prospect that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has explicitly opposed.

The senior administration official told CNN that the apparent disagreement between the US and Israel over a future role for the PA is overstated. The US agrees that the Palestinian Authority in its current, weakened state would be unlikely to be able to govern Gaza, but that a “revitalized” PA – including potentially with new leadership entirely – is a plausible solution.

Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told Bloomberg that he sees a role for Hamas in future Gaza governance – a prospect that would also be firmly rejected by Israel, whose stated goal is to eliminate the group. US officials have said there cannot be a return to the “status quo” before October 7. The Western diplomat told CNN that privately, many of the Arab partners also do not want Hamas to remain in control in Gaza.

It’s not clear that such an arrangement is even possible, given the long history of enmity between Hamas in Gaza and its bitter political rival Fatah, which controls the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The two sides have tried – and failed – multiple times to reach an agreement to unite the two separate Palestinian territories under one governance structure.

Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation agreement in Cairo in October 2017 under pressure from the Arab states, led by Egypt. Under the deal, a new unity government was supposed to take administrative control of Gaza two months later, ending a decade of rivalry that began when Hamas violently evicted the Palestinian Authority from Gaza in 2007.

But the deal’s lofty aspirations quickly collapsed. When Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah visited Gaza in March 2018, he was the target of an assassination attempt when a bomb detonated near his convoy. Hamdallah’s Fatah party immediately blamed Hamas for the attack.

387,Egypt’s president expected to secure third term as the world’s eyes are fixed on Gaza,"CNN —

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to secure his third term in power in a Sunday presidential election that critics have called a sham, as global attention is focused on the bloody war in neighboring Gaza.

The 69-year-old president has enjoyed two months of a pause in criticism from Western allies over his authoritarian rule and heightened crackdown on dissent, experts say, attributing the shift to Sisi’s renewed diplomatic relevance on the international stage due to the Israel-Hamas war.

Several top Western officials have paid Sisi visits since the war began, including United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

HA Hellyer, nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in London, said that Cairo has historically been “a critical interlocutor for the international community in general when it comes to the Arab-Israeli conflict.”

“As the Israeli-Palestinian question diminished in importance in many policy arenas, which was clearly a fundamentally flawed approach, so did Cairo’s geopolitical weight,” Hellyer told CNN, adding that with the Palestinian issue now prominently back in discussions, “there is a new prioritization internationally for good and comprehensive contact with Egypt.”

Egypt controls the Rafah crossing, the sole remaining link between the Gaza Strip – which Hamas controls – and the outside world. Egyptian officials have played mediation roles in previous wars between Israel and Hamas, as Cairo maintains diplomatic ties with both sides. During the current conflict, Egypt’s good offices have been used to deliver crucial aid into Gaza and to help secure the release of some of the hostages held there by Hamas since its militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting more than 240 others.

Egypt has also helped foreign nationals escape the carnage in Gaza, along with injured Palestinians. More than 17,000 Palestinians have so far been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which cites sources from the Hamas-controlled enclave. Aid has also been able to trickle into Gaza through Rafah.

Meanwhile, Sisi is moving to quietly secure another presidential term with little to no opposition at home or abroad, critics say.

“There are no elections. There is electoral theater,” Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington, DC, told CNN, citing the lack of viable opposition to Sisi.

The former field marshal rose to power in 2013 after overthrowing Mohamed Morsy, Egypt’s only democratically elected president, in a military coup. Sisi ran for president in 2014 and 2018, winning both elections with a sweeping majority. In 2019, his government passed constitutional amendments that permitted him to run for a third term.

“The terrible violence we’re witnessing (in Gaza) helped Sisi divide the attention of the public from their domestic concerns onto what’s happening, particularly the Palestinians in Gaza,” Kaldas said. “And as a result, somewhat reduce the level of focus on their own domestic plight, particularly their economic struggles.”

Egypt has also spent the past two months reminding its international partners of how “vitally important” it is, Kaldas said. Egypt can say: “See the useful role we play in negotiations and facilitation of the humanitarian assistance that needs to go to Gaza,” he added.

Sisi has appeared keen to capitalize on the crisis and present himself as a champion of the Palestinian cause. In a speech last month, the president repeated his call for a ceasefire, as well as his refusal of the “displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip,” calling such a prospect a red line.

While diplomats have been focused on Gaza, critics and human rights groups have lambasted Egypt over the past two months for what they say is its suppression of political dissent and silencing of opposition candidates.

Former lawmaker Ahmed el-Tantawy, who was the most prominent potential challenger to Sisi before he ended his campaign in October, said his supporters were restricted from registering their endorsements for him. He ended his campaign after failing to register the number of signatures required to run.

The Egyptian National Elections Authority (NEA) denied el-Tantawy’s claims, according to state media.

Three other candidates are running for president, with little support expected for each. These are the head of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, Farid Zahran; Wafd party nominee Abdel Sanad Yamama; and Republican Peoples’ Party candidate Hazem Omar.

Rights watchdog Amnesty International said last month that “genuine opposition candidates (were) barred from running” in Sunday’s election, adding that since October 1, Egyptian authorities “have arrested and interrogated at least 196 individuals due to their participation in unauthorized protests, as well as on allegations of engaging in terrorism-related activities and spreading ‘false news.’”

Amnesty also criticized Egypt’s prosecution of el-Tantawy, along with members of his campaign, which the rights group says are under fire “in retaliation for exercising their rights to political participation and to freedom of expression and association.”

El-Tantawy is accused of circulating election-related papers without the permission of the authorities. His trial date was pushed to January 9.

“Once more, the Egyptian authorities lay bare their utter intolerance for even the faintest whisper of dissent,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, as he urged the country to lift “sweeping restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.”

The Egyptian government’s foreign press center did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.

‘No one will come out to vote’

Just days before the election, streets in the capital, Cairo, were draped with large banners bearing Sisi’s portrait. An increased security presence is noticeable throughout the city, with officers and checkpoints dotting squares, highways and the entrances to bridges.

Among those boosting the pro-Sisi campaign is the Nation’s Future Party. “We are all with you” and “beloved of millions,” read the party’s pro-Sisi banners.

Despite the president’s high-profile election campaign, public sentiment is marked by frustration. Grievances regarding the economy are most evident.

Magdy Gerges, an Egyptian in his 50s who works as a driver, said economic hardships were painful, but that he feels a sense of security under Sisi’s rule.

“I’m one of those who suffer from the high prices, but this man (Sisi) gives me something more important than food; that I feel safe whenever my daughters go out,” Gerges told CNN. “By the end of the day, we will manage with our income, but what good is money if there is no security?” he said.

Gerges noted however that there are no other viable alternative candidates for voters to choose from, especially given the region’s precarious security situation.

“Even if we want to choose someone else, we have no alternative,” he said.

Another citizen, who asked to remain anonymous fearing reprisal from Egyptian authorities, questioned the legitimacy of Sunday’s election, saying polling stations will be empty since Sisi’s victory is clear.

“No one will come out to vote. People know the result in advance, so why this farce?” the man told CNN, saying it might have been better to “save these huge sums of money in the difficult economic conditions we are living in.”

Hellyer, of the Carnegie Endowment, said that with the current crisis in Gaza, Cairo might even see “potential for substantial economic assistance” from foreign nations, given the role it has played.

Egypt has been struggling to dig itself out of a debt hole that experts say requires structural reforms to avert economic collapse. Cairo’s allies in the Persian Gulf, who for years bailed out the most populous Arab nation, had in recent months criticized Egypt, saying the days of blank cheques are now over.

Egypt’s economic woes are far from resolved. Inflation is still high, and a foreign currency crisis remains unremedied. The country is also yet to meet the terms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $3 billion loan secured in December 2022 but which is yet to be disbursed.

Kaldas, of the Tahrir Institute, said that the Egyptian pound is expected to devalue further. The dollar now trades officially at 31 Egyptian pounds, and if the government decides to further devalue the exchange rate after the elections, that will translate to higher inflation, a deepening of economic hardship for individuals and businesses, and a rise in poverty, he said.

“There is no short-term scenario that doesn’t mean more economic pain for the average Egyptian,” Kaldas added.

The election takes place from December 10 to December 12. Results are expected by December 18.","['worlds', 'international', 'egyptian', 'economic', 'expected', 'sisi', 'egypt', 'opposition', 'eyes', 'egypts', 'president', 'gaza', 'term', 'cairo', 'election', 'secure', 'fixed']","CNN —Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to secure his third term in power in a Sunday presidential election that critics have called a sham, as global attention is focused on the bloody war in neighboring Gaza.

388,Harvard President apologizes for her comments during her congressional testimony in an interview with the student newspaper,"CNN —

The president of Harvard University apologized in an interview with the school’s student newspaper after facing widespread condemnation for her disastrous congressional testimony this week, in which she and other university presidents failed to explicitly say calls for genocide of Jewish people constituted bullying and harassment on campus.

“I am sorry,” Harvard University president Claudine Gay said to The Harvard Crimson on Thursday. “Words matter.”

The apology came just days after Gay, the president of the University of Pennsylvania and the president of MIT testified at a House committee hearing focused on antisemitism on campus, to widespread criticism that they have not done enough to ensure the safety of Jewish students and others at their respective schools.

Harvard, UPenn and MIT have all come under fire – along with other US academic institutions – over perceived inaction against antisemitism on their campuses, especially in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel and the subsequent war.

At UPenn, for example, President Liz Magill has been under pressure to resign for weeks, as major donors and others say they have lost confidence in her ability to lose the school.

Harvard is also among 14 colleges under investigation by the Department of Education “for discrimination involving shared ancestry” since the October attacks.

During Tuesday’s House hearing, Gay, along with the UPenn and MIT presidents, did not explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct on bullying or harassment. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

Gay told the Harvard student paper that she regretted what she said.

“When words amplify distress and pain, I don’t know how you could feel anything but regret,” she said to The Crimson.

“I got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures,” Gay told the newspaper. “What I should have had the presence of mind to do in that moment was return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our Jewish community — threats to our Jewish students — have no place at Harvard, and will never go unchallenged.”

“Substantively, I failed to convey what is my truth,” she added.

The Harvard president told the paper she’s heard about how much pain students are in over the past few months.

“To contemplate that something I said amplified that pain — that’s really difficult,” Gay said to The Crimson. “It makes me sad.”

Flood of criticism

Gay has faced plenty of calls to resign, most notably from Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, a Harvard graduate who has been a vocal critic of how universities have addressed antisemitism on campus

“Throughout the hearing, the three behaved like hostile witnesses,” Ackman wrote in a post on X earlier this week, “exhibiting a profound disdain for the Congress with their smiles and smirks, and their outright refusal to answer basic questions with a yes or no answer.”

“They must all resign in disgrace,” Ackman said.

But the criticism from donors, politicians, alumni and business leaders has been reserved mostly for UPenn’s Magill, who appears most imminently at risk of losing her job. She faces a donor rebellion, including a threat from one donor to pull a $100 million gift. The Wharton board also said it wants Magill ousted.

Underscoring the anger at the three university presidents’ testimony, on Friday a bipartisan group of more than 70 US lawmakers sent a letter to board members of all three universities, demanding the dismissal of Gay and the presidents of UPenn and MIT.

“Given this moment of crisis, we demand that your boards immediately remove each of these presidents from their positions and that you provide an actionable plan to ensure that Jewish and Israeli students, teachers, and faculty are safe on your campuses,” the lawmakers wrote.

“The university presidents’ responses to questions aimed at addressing the growing trend of antisemitism on college and university campuses were abhorrent,” the bipartisan group added.

Magill, like Gay, clarified her remarks Wednesday, a day after the controversial testimony. Magill said in a short video that she should have been more forceful in her condemnation of hate speech, particularly calls for genocide.

“I was not focused on – but I should have been – the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It’s evil. Plain, and simple,” Magill said in a video posted on X. “I want to be clear: A call for genocide of Jewish people … would be harassment or intimidation.”

Unlike Gay, however, Magill has not apologized for her testimony.","['gay', 'newspaper', 'comments', 'presidents', 'upenn', 'university', 'congressional', 'apologizes', 'student', 'president', 'testimony', 'jewish', 'students', 'harvard', 'interview', 'magill']","CNN —The president of Harvard University apologized in an interview with the school’s student newspaper after facing widespread condemnation for her disastrous congressional testimony this week, in which she and other university presidents failed to explicitly say calls for genocide of Jewish people constituted bullying and harassment on campus.

389,Rishi Sunak is picking a fight on the migration issue that he probably cannot win,"CNN —

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has a major problem.

As his governing Conservative Party prepares to enter what will likely be an election year in 2024, it is languishing behind the opposition Labour Party in polls week after week.

The Conservatives have been in power since 2010, during which time they’ve gone through five prime ministers and virtually every possible iteration of conservatism imaginable. And after 13 years in power, it’s fair to say the party looks a little tired and out of ideas.

This is why Sunak is leaning into the Conservatives’ historical trump card issue: immigration.

Sunak, himself the son of immigrants, is currently throwing absolutely everything he has at trying to bring down the UK’s net migration numbers – which reached a record high of 745,000 in 2022.

That high number exists for various reasons: The UK has had generous policies to welcome people fleeing Ukraine and Hong Kong in recent years.

Since leaving the European Union, the UK is no longer part of the Dublin Regulation, an EU law that is designed to share the burden of hosting asylum seekers across the bloc by allowing member states to return migrants to the EU country they first entered – something the UK used effectively and benefited from.

The implications of this can be seen most clearly in the number of people now crossing the English Channel in small boats.

The boats are largely run by criminal trafficking gangs who help migrants illegally enter the UK in unsafe, crowded vessels that have on multiple occasions led to people drowning.

While these small boats are not the chief reason for the UK’s immigration numbers, they arguably have the highest profile.

In 2018 , the number of people detected crossing the English Channel in small boats was 299, according to Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. In 2022, that number was 45,755.

Of course, 45,755 is a fraction of the 745,000 net immigration total. However, for the places that are most affected by these small boat landings, that enormous increase is very visible. For the people who live in areas where these migrants end up being housed while their asylum claims are processed, it is impossible not to notice the influx into local populations.

Politically, small boat crossings have become a touchstone issue for the next election – hence Sunak making stopping the boats one of his five key priorities at the start of this year.

He has inherited a controversial plan from his predecessors whereby the UK reached an agreement with Rwanda that refugees could be sent to that country instead of staying in the UK. To date, the UK has not sent a single person to Rwanda because courts have prevented them from doing so. Most notably, the European Court of Human Rights has blocked flights to Rwanda from taking off. In short, there are human rights concerns that people who are sent to Rwanda could still face oppression in Rwanda or be sent back to their country of origin.

Sunak this week unveiled a bill that was designed to block any legal reason that planes were not flying people to Rwanda. His immigration minister resigned hours later and it is possible that his government will lose a vote on the bill in parliament next week. Meanwhile it was revealed that the British government had paid the Rwandan government an additional £100m this year as part of the deal. It had already sent £140m to the country.

For a country that in 2016 voted to leave the European Union, a foreign court interfering with domestic law is something that creates political opportunities. Enter Nigel Farage.

Farage, one of the most high-profile Brexit campaigners, has been using his media profile and daily TV show to talk about small boats for a long time.

His tactic of attacking Sunak and the Conservatives from the right has over time forced some on the right of the Conservative Party to call for increasingly tough action on immigration. Some even think there is an argument for the UK leaving the ECHR. And with an election coming up, some are even wondering if promising some kind of referendum on the UK’s membership of the ECHR in the Conservative manifesto might be a way of keeping voters who are tempted to cast their ballots for smaller right-wing parties.

Indeed, Sunak’s recently-sacked home secretary said in a statement to parliament earlier this week: “The powers to detain and remove must be exercisable notwithstanding the Human Rights Act, the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention, and all other international law … it is now or never. The Conservative Party faces electoral oblivion in a matter of months if we introduce yet another Bill destined to fail. Do we fight for sovereignty or let our party die?”

If this all sounds familiar, that’s because it’s all happened before. It was Farage’s Euroskeptic rabble-rousing that forced former Conservative leader David Cameron to put a Brexit vote in his party’s 2015 manifesto. Cameron won that election, but was forced to resign a year later after losing the referendum. Sunak can at least ask Cameron for advice, having recently made him the UK’s foreign secretary.

While Cameron has been publicly supportive of Sunak’s Rwanda plan and the bill introduced this week, it’s not hard to imagine him telling his boss that on Europe and immigration, the Conservatives simply cannot win.

The reality is that the bar set by Farage and some of his own MPs is so high that there is no way Sunak can clear it. Whatever he does, it will never be enough for the voters most-motivated by migration.

On the left – which in modern British politics can at times really mean center-right – Sunak risks looking cruel, kicking down at people who are fleeing war zones and trying to send them to a place where they are still not safe.

Sunak is desperate to flip the debate over to Labour, forcing them to take a position on immigration – but this issue is intensely toxic for Conservatives. There will always be people with the luxury of sitting outside of mainstream politics who can make noise.

And beside all of this, British attitudes to migration have evolved in the past few years – the idea of simply being strong on immigration winning votes for the Conservatives is not as true as it once was.

Some who saw it as a key issue now recognize that the health service benefited from migrant labor. Some feel post-Brexit that their concerns were addressed and that the country now has control over immigration. There are still people who care a lot about migration, of course, but the general direction of travel is that views are softening.

Given the difficult position he’s in, it’s no surprise that Sunak is looking for wedge issues ahead of the next election. But it might be that the PM has picked a fight he simply can’t win.","['rishi', 'rwanda', 'fight', 'immigration', 'party', 'sunak', 'picking', 'week', 'migration', 'small', 'conservatives', 'uk', 'boats', 'issue', 'probably', 'win', 'sent']","The implications of this can be seen most clearly in the number of people now crossing the English Channel in small boats.

390,Bear attacks in Japan are at a record high. Climate change and an aging population are making the problem worse,"Tokyo CNN —

Seishi Sato had an ominous feeling when he saw something rustling in a bush during a recent stroll in a forest in northern Japan.

Before he knew it, two Asiatic bears had sprung from the shrub, one charging at him as he frantically tried to fend it off while fearing for his life.

“When I saw them, I was so close and I thought I was in deep trouble,” the 57-year-old from Iwate prefecture, in northeast Japan, told CNN.

He survived the attack — but not without plenty of scratches and puncture wounds on his arm and thigh.

Sato is among at least 212 people who survived what has been a record year for bear attacks in Japan, according to the Ministry of Environment. Six people have died.

With a month of 2023 still to go, this year’s total has already far surpassed the 158 that took place throughout the whole of 2020 (the previous record year). And the number of bear attacks have never exceeded 200 per year since record began in 2006.

Sightings of “kuma”, or bears, are not unusual in Japan but are generally concentrated in the northern part of the country, where mountain ranges, lush bush and crystal-clear rivers provide an ideal habitat and abundant sources of the acorns, beechnuts, fruits and insects that make up their diet.

But experts say Japan’s bears are increasingly venturing out of their traditional habitats and into urban areas in search of food. Some suggest this is because climate change is interfering with the flowering and pollination of some of the animals’ traditional sources of food.

“Bears are expanding their home range this year and are coming down to areas near human settlements in search of food,” said associate professor Maki Yamamoto, who studies bears at the Nagaoka University of Technology in Niigata.

Increasingly, this is bringing them into the paths of people like Sato, who was attacked just a half-hour walk from the shop he runs, where he sells pet supplies and mushrooms he picks from the forest.

“People are becoming very alert to this situation,” said Sato, adding that other residents had been attacked outside the front doors of their village homes.

As of November, there had been 19,191 sightings across the country, up from 11,135 sightings throughout the whole of the previous year and 12,743 in 2021.

Iwate, where Sato lives, has logged more cases than anywhere else - 5,158 – followed by its neighboring prefecture of Akita, which has reported 3,000 sightings.

So pressing has the issue become that Environment Minister Shintaro Ito pledged last month to help affected communities.

“We are considering providing emergency assistance to local communities in response to their needs, such as surveying and capturing bears living in the vicinity of human settlements, taking into consideration the wishes of prefectures where human casualties due to bears are particularly on the rise,” he told a press conference.

Protective mama bears

Japan is home to two main types of bear: brown bears, which live in Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan’s main islands, and a small population of Asiatic bears, which reside in Honshu, Japan’s largest island.

Both breeds have an omnivorous diet, enjoy feeding on acorns and tend to avoid humans if possible. An Asiatic bear weighs between 40 and 100 kg while a Japanese brown bear can grow up to 400kg. But both are far from being the biggest bear on earth. Kodiak Brown Bears in Alaska, for example, can weigh up to 600kg.

“Both brown bears and Asiatic black bears are basically timid animals that avoid people,” said Professor Koji Yamazaki from the Tokyo University of Agriculture.

When bears do attack, the cause is usually because a mother bear fears an encounter with a human poses a threat to her cub, experts said.

Sato, who runs the YouTube channel Primitive Forest Bear to share his adventures in nature, recalled that the Asiatic bears he ran into appeared to be mother and child.

He captured the attack on camera and posted the video online as a reminder to others to take care.

The video, which has since gone viral, shows him screaming for his life and hitting the animal with a tree branch to drive it away. At one point, he climbs a tree to avoid being mauled. Luckily, the bear eventually turns away.

“When I saw the video, I was scared to death,” Sato said.

Climate change and population shifts

With encounters on the increase, some experts believe climate change may be a factor in pushing bears further from their traditional habitats.

“The thing is that you can have years of bad harvests and years of good harvest of acorns. And when the harvest is bad, the bears cannot store enough energy before hibernation by eating mountain acorns alone, so they get closer to human settlements looking for fruits, chestnuts, persimmons, walnuts, and farm products in general,” Yamamoto, from Nagaoka University of Technology, explained.

“This year, bears have been appearing more in the villages precisely because of the very bad harvest of acorns from the beech, the bears’ favorite tree,” she said.

Tsutomu Mano, a senior research fellow at the Hokkaido Research Organization, said climate change “is likely to have a significant impact on the flowering time of plants and the activity of insects responsible for pollination, which is necessary for fruiting.”

And when the bears don’t have enough food, they often turn to human neighborhoods to look for leftovers in the bins, he said.

Once they’ve developed a taste for human leftovers they will keep returning for more, Mano said.

Another factor that some believe may be coming into play is Japan’s rapidly shifting demographics.

With a median age of 48, Japan has one of the world’s oldest populations, according to the Economic and Social for Asia and the Pacific, a United Nations’ arm that tracks population trends.

At the same time, the country is experiencing a shift in which younger generations are increasingly moving to big cities for better job opportunities.

Taken together, the two factors mean populations on the rural edges of northern prefectures are fast dwindling, creating conditions such as “abandonment of cultivated land and overgrowth along riversides” that “make it easier for bears to enter,” according to Mano.

According to national broadcaster NHK, out of the 71 people attacked by bears in October, 61 were above the age of 60. Twenty-one people were in their 80s.

On October 24 alone, four people – all in the 70s – were injured in Akita on the same day, the broadcaster reported.

What’s the solution?

At Karuizawa, a resort town located in Nagano prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, conservationists have taken to patrolling the forest with dogs to scare the bears away, according to local media.

But officials in Akita prefecture, which recorded the second-highest number of bear attacks, have a more drastic measure in store. They have begun offering rewards to trappers.

Governor Norihisa Satake announced late last month a 5,000-yen ($33) prize for each bear captured in the prefecture. The authorities are also mulling a proposal to set aside a fund of up to 15 million yen ($100,000) to pay for the transportation of the captured bears.

But experts say a more holistic approach is needed.

“Trapping is not sufficient to manage bears, so it is necessary to consider a combination of various methods,” said Yamazaki, from the Tokyo University of Agriculture.

The first step was to study what types of bear – in terms of their ages, genders and locations - were going astray and why, he said.","['record', 'sato', 'brown', 'making', 'climate', 'japan', 'population', 'problem', 'high', 'bear', 'bears', 'asiatic', 'university', 'change', 'prefecture', 'human', 'worse', 'acorns']","Before he knew it, two Asiatic bears had sprung from the shrub, one charging at him as he frantically tried to fend it off while fearing for his life.

391,Six French teenagers convicted in connection with 2020 beheading of teacher Paty,"CNN —

A French court on Friday convicted six teenagers in connection with the 2020 beheading of history teacher Samuel Paty, whose murder shocked the country.

The teacher had shown his pupils caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression, angering some Muslim parents. Most Muslims avoid depictions of prophets, considering them to be blasphemous.

Among those on trial was a teenage girl who had allegedly told her parents that Paty had asked Muslim pupils to leave the room before showing the caricatures.

The court found her guilty of having made false accusation charges and slanderous comments, as it was established that she was not in the class at the time.

The other adolescents were found guilty of charges related to taking part in a pre-meditated criminal conspiracy and helping to prepare an ambush.

Paty, 47, was killed outside his school in a Paris suburb by an 18-year-old assailant of Chechen origin, who was shot dead by police soon after the attack.

The court found those adolescents guilty of having pointed out Paty to the murderer.

Louis Cailliez, lawyer for Paty’s sister Mickaelle, told reporters his client was “satisfied with the full conviction,” but less so with the sentences, that she found “too lenient”.

Dylan Slama, a lawyer for one of the teenagers, said that though it was hard to talk about satisfaction in such tragic circumstances, there was a sense of relief for his client.

The heaviest sentence was given to an adolescent who was formally given a 6-month prison sentence, although he should be able to serve this at home while under electronic surveillance.

The girl who was found guilty of making false accusations and slanderous comments was given an 18-month suspended sentence and put on probation measures for two years.

All six teenagers’ suspended sentences are tied to them following a strict set of probation measures for two to three years.

392,Appeals court maintains most of Trump gag order in federal election subversion case,"CNN —

An appeals court has largely upheld the gag order against former President Donald Trump in the federal election subversion case, saying he can be barred from talking about witnesses as well as prosecutors, the court staff and their family members.

But the court said the gag order does not apply to comments made about special counsel Jack Smith and narrows the prohibition Trump had for speaking about witnesses in the case, a change from the original gag order.

The decision against Trump is a striking admonishment for an ex-president facing an upcoming criminal trial, but also makes clear Trump is still allowed to criticize President Joe Biden and the Justice Department and to argue the prosecution “is politically motivated or that he is innocent of the charges against him.”

The three appeals court judges who issued Friday’s ruling — Patricia Millett, Nina Pillard and Bradley Garcia, all Democratic appointees — found Trump’s words on the public stage could undermine the fairness of a jury trial, sway or intimidate witnesses and imperil court staff. The court said that justifies limiting Trump’s speech, even while he campaigns to return to the presidency.

It is the second time in recent weeks that an appeals court has reinstated limits on what Trump can say publicly. Trump’s also under a gag order in New York barring him from attacking court staff in a civil fraud trial against him and his business there. Trump is set to testify in that case on Monday.

Trump vowed to appeal the decision in a social media post on Friday.

Friday’s lengthy opinion came from all three judges who heard Trump’s appeal at the DC Circuit Court nearly two weeks ago, and was written by Millett.

“Mr. Trump’s documented pattern of speech and its demonstrated real-time, real-world consequences pose a significant and imminent threat to the functioning of the criminal trial process in this case,” the appeals court wrote.

The court said that Trump’s campaign for the 2024 presidency “does not alter the court’s historical commitment or obligation to ensure the fair administration of justice in criminal cases.”

“We do not allow such an order lightly. Mr. Trump is a former President and current candidate for the presidency, and there is a strong public interest in what he has to say,” the court said.

“But Mr. Trump is also an indicted criminal defendant, and he must stand trial in a courtroom under the same procedures that govern all other criminal defendants. That is what the rule of law means.”

Court cites Trump’s attacks on Meadows and Pence

In explaining their decision, the appeals court pointed to the former president’s many public statements and attacks against witnesses in the case, including former chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Vice President Mike Pence.

The court said that such statements “pose a significant” risk that witnesses would be intimidated and “unduly influenced” in the case. Some witnesses have “had their lives turned upside down after coming within Mr. Trump’s verbal sights,” the court wrote.

The court also noted that Trump is subject to release conditions barring him from direct communication with witnesses.

That prohibition “would mean little if he can evade it by making the same statements to a crowd, knowing or expecting that a witness will get the message,” the court wrote.

The risk to witnesses “is largely irreversible in the age of the Internet,” the court noted. “Once an individual is publicly targeted, even revoking the offending statement may not abate the subsequent threats, harassment, or other intimidating effects during the pretrial as well as trial stages of this case.”

The court also noted Trump’s public statement shortly after being charged in the case, “If go after me, I’m coming after you,” as a broadly threatening message toward people working on the case, and said his “messaging [was] daggered at likely witnesses and their testimony.”

Trump is still able to publicly share opinions about witnesses who include several high-profile critics of his who served in his presidential administration.

Trial delay would ‘simply compound the problem’

In the ruling Friday, the appeals court pushed back forcefully against Trump’s argument that his criminal trial should be delayed until after the 2024 presidential election as an alternative to limiting his speech, writing that it would be “counterproductive, create perverse incentives, and unreasonably burden the judicial process.”

Trump has repeatedly argued in court that his criminal trial in the election interference case, which is scheduled for March, should be delayed until after the November presidential election. So far, all of his efforts have been rejected.

“Allowing prejudicial statements to go unchecked for an even longer pre-trial period would simply compound the problem,” the appeals court wrote.

The court also said that allowing the former president’s threatening speech to “override the district court’s control and management of the trial schedule” would incentivize other criminal defendants to also say or post harmful things as a means of delaying their own prosecutions.

The gag order doesn’t prohibit Trump from making any comments but rather statements “made with the intent to materially interfere” with the case. For instance, Trump can publicly speak about witnesses, the appeals court said, but not about their “potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding.”

The appeals court said his words about possible witnesses would have to be looked at in context.

“That allows the former President to continue to speak out about those same persons’ books, articles, editorials, interviews, or political campaigns as long as he does so in a manner that does not concern their roles as witnesses or the content of any expected testimony,” the court wrote.

In addition, the court strongly backed his ability to disparage the special counsel.

“As a high-ranking government official who exercises ultimate control over the conduct of this prosecution, the Special Counsel is no more entitled to protection from lawful public criticism than is the institution he represents,” the court wrote.

After starring in several TV shows throughout the 1960s, O’Neal made an indelible mark on the movies in the 1970 adaptation of the Erich Segal novel “Love Story,” in which he starred opposite Ali MacGraw. The tearjerker film told the story of a wealthy Ivy Leaguer (Ryan O’Neal) who marries an outspoken and irreverent girl (MacGraw), only to watch her die of a terminal illness. Among other things, it popularized the line, “Love means never having to say you’re sorry.”

The film was a huge hit, providing a major boost to Paramount Pictures (which was being run by MacGraw’s then-husband, Robert Evans), and while it established Ryan O’Neal as a classic leading man – and earned him an Oscar nomination in the process – he also found success in comedy, playing opposite Barbra Streisand in “What’s Up, Doc?” and “The Main Event.”

On X (formerly Twitter), Streisand said she was “sad” to hear the news of the actor’s death.

“He was funny and charming, and he will be remembered,” she wrote.

Ryan O’Neal later starred in a “Love Story” sequel called “Oliver’s Story,” which flopped at the box office.

The actor’s eclectic resume included starring with his daughter, Tatum O’Neal, in “Paper Moon,” for which she won an Academy Award for best supporting actress; and the Stanley Kubrick-directed period piece “Barry Lyndon.”

Off screen, O’Neal had a long relationship with actress and pin-up model Farrah Fawcett, which provided endless fodder for the tabloids. The relationship followed earlier marriages to actresses Joanna Moore and Leigh Taylor-Young.

Born in Los Angeles, O’Neal trained to become a professional boxer before he began to pursue acting, appearing in several TV westerns, and eventually landing his regular role on “Peyton Place.”

O’Neal’s more recent credits included recurring roles on the TV shows “Bones” and “Bull,” along with appearances on “Desperate Housewives” and the reboot “90210.”

Strained relationship

Ryan O’Neal and his daughter Tatum O’Neal’s off-screen relationship was strained for many years.

She had struggled with addiction, and in 2011, the father and daughter starred in the reality series “Ryan and Tatum: The O’Neals” on OWN.

A clip of that show was featured that year during a Tatum O’Neal appearance on CNN.

“How would I feel if my father were to, say, get sick or die even? Would I be OK? And I realized that I wouldn’t be OK,” she said in the clip. “So I knew I needed to make an effort, because what is your life without your family? What’s your life without a father?”

In 2020, Tatum O’Neal’s son shared on social media that the family had reconciled.

The actor had four children. In addition to Tatum O’Neal, he had a son, Griffin O’Neal, with Moore. He also had a son, Redmond James O’Neal, with Fawcett. Patrick O’Neal, a sportscaster, was from his marriage with Taylor-Young.

His brother, actor Kevin O’Neal, died earlier this year.

395,European Union agrees to regulate AI development,"CNN —

European Union lawmakers struck a deal Friday agreeing to one of the world’s first major comprehensive artificial intelligence laws.

The landmark legislation, called the AI Act, sets up a regulatory framework to promote the development of AI while addressing the risks associated with the rapidly evolving technology. The legislation bans harmful AI practices “considered to be a clear threat to people’s safety, livelihoods and rights.”

The law comes amid growing fears about the disruptive capabilities of artificial intelligence.

In a news conference, Roberta Metsola, the president of the European Parliament, called the law “a balanced and human-centered approach” that will “no doubt be setting the global standard for years to come.”

The regulatory framework, which classifies AI uses by risk and increases regulation on higher risk levels, was first proposed in 2021.

The riskiest uses for AI are banned. According to the law, those include systems that exploit specific vulnerable groups, biometric identification systems for law enforcement purposes and artificial intelligence that deploys manipulative “subliminal techniques.”

Limited risk systems, such as chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, or technology that generates images, audio or video content, are subject to new transparency obligations under the law.

“The #AIAct is much more than a rulebook – it’s a launchpad for EU startups and researchers to lead the global AI race,” Thierry Breton, the EU Commissioner for Internal Market, wrote on social media. “The best is yet to come.”

Artificial intelligence broke into the mainstream with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. Seemingly overnight, generative AI technology exploded in popularity and spurred an AI arms race.

But AI’s disruption reaches far beyond the world of big tech: Educators have struggled with generative AI’s ability to complete schoolwork assignments; artists and musicians have grappled with the potential for AI-fueled imitation; and even the media industry has seen its controversies.

Some of the companies behind the technology have experienced growing pains, as well.

OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, was briefly ousted and then reinstated over the course of a few drama-filled days in November – with the exact reasons for the leadership changes still unclear, weeks later.

396,Tomato lost in space by history-making astronaut has been found,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Perhaps nowhere in the universe is a fresh, ripe tomato more valuable than on the International Space Station, where astronauts live for months at a time subsisting mainly on prepackaged, shelf-stable goods.

That’s why astronaut Frank Rubio became the central figure in a lighthearted whodunnit that has taken months to solve.

After Rubio harvested one of the first tomatoes ever grown in space earlier this year, according to the astronaut, he admitted he misplaced it.

“I put it in a little bag, and one of my crewmates was doing a (public) event with some schoolkids, and I thought it’d be kind of cool to show the kids — ‘Hey guys this is the first tomato harvested in space,’” Rubio said during an October media event. “I was pretty confident that I Velcroed it where I was supposed to Velcro it … and then I came back and it was gone.”

In the microgravity environment of space, anything not anchored to a wall is at risk of floating away — destined to spend eternity hidden behind a nook or cranny within the football field-size orbiting laboratory and its labyrinthian passageways.

Rubio said he probably spent eight to 20 hours of his own free time just searching for that tomato.

“Unfortunately — because that’s just human nature — a lot of people are like, ‘He probably ate the tomato,’” Rubio said. “And I wanted to find it mostly so I could prove like I did not eat the tomato.”

But he never found it.

Rubio returned to Earth on September 27 with the precious produce still lost aboard the space station.

It remained lost — until now.

During a Wednesday news conference, members of the seven-person crew remaining on the space station revealed they had finally located the tomato.

Rubio had “been blamed for quite a while for eating the tomato,” NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli said. “But we can exonerate him.”

Tomato on top of a historic mission

The astronauts did not reveal where the tomato was or specify what state the produce was in when found.

Rubio surmised in October that it had probably already shriveled into an unrecognizable rot.

Due to the humidity at the space station, “it probably desiccated to the point where you couldn’t tell what it was,” Rubio said.

Case closed.

Rubio’s return to Earth in September was a historic moment. His stay on the space station — which lasted more than a year — set a record for the longest a US astronaut has ever spent in microgravity.

Rubio originally expected to spend only six months aboard the International Space Station. Instead, he logged 371 days following the discovery of a coolant leak coming from his original ride — a Russian Soyuz spacecraft — while it was docked to the orbiting outpost.

In his October interview, Rubio acknowledged how arduous moments of the journey were.

“I kind of allowed myself a day to feel sad and sorry for myself, and then I try to really make a conscious decision to say OK let’s have a good attitude and let’s just try to do the best job possible,” Rubio said of learning his stay would be extended by another six months.

397,"Three dead in outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, CDC warns","CNN —

An outbreak of the tickborne disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever has caused at least five illnesses, including three deaths, in the US since July, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Friday.

The five cases were identified in Southern California and involved people who had traveled to Tecate, Baja California, in the previous two weeks. Four were under age 18, and three were US residents, the agency said in a health alert. All five were hospitalized, and three died.

The CDC is warning health care providers that if a patient has symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and has recently traveled to northern Mexico, they should consider starting treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline right away, rather than waiting for test results to confirm the condition.

“RMSF is a severe, rapidly progressive, and often deadly disease transmitted by the bite of infected ticks, although many patients do not recall being bitten by a tick,” the agency notes. It’s endemic in northern Mexico and in parts of the southwestern US, where it can be transmitted by brown dog ticks. It does not spread from person to person.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Signs of infection can be mild in the first few days, including a low fever, headache, stomach problems, abdominal pain, rash and swelling around the eyes and on the back of the hands. On or after about five days, someone may develop changes in mental state, coma, brain swelling, respiratory problems and multiorgan damage. It’s fatal in 5% to 10% of cases, with about half of those deaths happening within eight days of the onset of illness.

Anyone who’s traveled to northern Mexico and develops symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever within two weeks of their return to the US should get medical attention right away, the CDC says. Protect against tick bites by treating pet dogs, using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing when outdoors. Check yourself and children for ticks after spending time outdoors or around dogs, and immediately remove any ticks you find.","['mountain', 'outbreak', 'rocky', 'cdc', 'northern', 'traveled', 'fever', 'ticks', 'mexico', 'dead', 'health', 'spotted', 'warns', 'disease']","CNN —An outbreak of the tickborne disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever has caused at least five illnesses, including three deaths, in the US since July, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Friday.

398,Billionaire Ken Langone is latest GOP megadonor to endorse Nikki Haley,"CNN —

Billionaire Ken Langone on Friday endorsed Nikki Haley’s presidential bid in the latest sign of the Republican moneyed class rallying behind her as the main alternative to Donald Trump in the GOP primary.

“I think she is just what we need right now. I think her approach is smart. I think she’s qualified,” Langone said on Fox News. “More importantly, I think the American people need this kind of leadership – statesmanlike, elegant. Just think of … where we have been in the last six or seven or eight years. It is not good at all.”

Langone, a co-founder of Home Depot, is the latest in a growing list of wealthy donors to back the former South Carolina governor. The network associated with billionaire Charles Koch announced its support for her last week, as did North Carolina retail magnate Art Pope. Earlier this week, LinkedIn co-founder and billionaire Democratic donor Reid Hoffman gave $250,000 to support her campaign.

Langone said that while he likes GOP contender Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor’s “numbers aren’t moving.”

“The writing is on the wall,” Langone told Fox News. “On the other hand, Nikki Haley has had a substantial upswing. The one thing I’m committed to is we have to beat Joe Biden. If Joe Biden is going to be the nominee, we have to beat him. We can’t take any more of this mayhem.”

Asked why he didn’t endorse Trump, Langone said the former president’s time has “come and gone” and condemned his actions toward the end of his White House tenure.

“What Trump put this country through the last three months of his presidency was disgraceful,” Langone said.

“I think what happened on January 6 – all he had to say is ‘Please go home.’ … But he sat in a room and watched it for three hours and did nothing about it and America deserves better than that,” he added.","['joe', 'endorse', 'megadonor', 'think', 'gop', 'support', 'trump', 'week', 'nikki', 'haley', 'langone', 'latest', 'need', 'billionaire', 'ken']","CNN —Billionaire Ken Langone on Friday endorsed Nikki Haley’s presidential bid in the latest sign of the Republican moneyed class rallying behind her as the main alternative to Donald Trump in the GOP primary.

399,Beyoncé and Taylor Swift have never had the rivalry many try to suggest,"CNN —

Beyoncé vs Taylor Swift is less about them than it is about a larger discussion about erasure and ethnicity.

Both women have been successful performers for decades, endorsing each other’s artistry along the way. But many of their supporters and cultural critics continue to compare their careers, along with how their work is received and acknowledged.

The latest example was the reception this week to Swift being named Time’s 2023 Person of the Year. New York Times bestselling author and cultural critic Luvvie Ajayi Jones noted Beyoncé’s omission from the list of individuals considered.

“Taylor being TIME person of the year while Beyoncé was not even nominated when they had VERY comparable years in terms quantifiable impact is actually wild,” Ajayi Jones wrote on Instagram.

“They both had record-breaking sold out world tours and BOTH shifted economies ad BOTH had documentaries come out,” she continued. “ONE of them was crowned the PERSON OF THE YEAR. While the other was not even considered for the title.”

Swift’s “Eras Tour” reportedly grossed more than an estimated $1 billion, while Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” tour reportedly grossed an estimated $570 million. However, she had 56 tour dates compared to Swift’s 146.

“Whether or not you are BeyHive [the term for her hardcore fans] or can’t stand her, you cannot deny the obvious erasure,” Ajayi Jones added. “Because there is only ONE main thing that makes her and Taylor different. You can be one of the most influential women in the world, and because you’re Black you can still be locked out.”

Other well known people, including journalist Cari Champion, responded with support in Ajayi Jones’ comments on the post.

“When tell you that YOU always have the time and you are ON TIME,” Champion remarked.

TV personality and author Nicole Waters commented, “She’s won everything and still can’t win. We thank God she doesn’t measure her worth by accolades issued by ‘not us.’ And that’s the lesson.”

For some, the selection of Swift is a continuation of the debate about industry disparities between Black and white artists and how their work is valued.

In 2017, there were accusations of racism after Adele topped Beyoncé in the album of the year category at the Grammy awards.

Yet the argument can be made that far from allowing issues of race to hold her back, Beyoncé has used it to fuel her art (see “Lemonade,” “Black Is King” and “Renaissance” for confirmation of that). It also bears mention that while she has not yet won an album of the year Grammy, Beyoncé holds the all-time record for most Grammy wins by a single artist with 32.

So while comparisons between the two artists may continue, the women themselves have only shown each other love.

Taylor Swift pushes back on comparing tours

In her interview with Time, Swift called out those who would position her in competition with Beyoncé.

“There were so many stadium tours this summer, but the only ones that were compared were me and Beyoncé,” Swift said. “Clearly it’s very lucrative for the media and stan culture to pit two women against each other, even when those two artists in question refuse to participate in that discussion.”

She also hailed Bey, saying “She’s the most precious gem of a person — warm and open and funny.”

“And she’s such a great disrupter of music-industry norms,” Swift said. “She taught every artist how to flip the table and challenge archaic business practices.”

Concert films

Both artists recently released films documenting their tours and attended the film premieres for the other.

In October, Swift gushed about Beyoncé showing up for the premiere for her “Eras Tour” concert film in Los Angeles.

“I’m so glad I’ll never know what my life would’ve been like without @beyonce’s influence. The way she’s taught me and every artist out here to break rules and defy industry norms,” Swift wrote in the caption of a video posted on social media showing the two of them inside of the theater. “Her generosity of spirit. Her resilience and versatility. She’s been a guiding light throughout my career and the fact that she showed up tonight was like an actual fairytale.”

Swift returned the gesture the following month, when Beyoncé’s film premiered in London.

Beyoncé literally gives Swift her flowers

In 2021, both women had a big night at the Grammys.

Swift won album of the year for “Folklore” and Beyoncé notched her 28th Grammy, becoming the most Grammy-winning female artist of all time.

The latter sent the former a beautiful bouquet of flowers with a note that read, “Congratulations on your Grammy. It was great seeing you on Sunday night. Thank you for always being so supportive. Sending love to you and your family. B.”

Swift shared a photo of the flowers and note on social media writing, “Woke up to flowers from the queen of grace & greatness @beyonce and suddenly it’s the best Friday EVER. Thank you B and congratulations on your epic achievement Sunday night!!”

Beyoncé shares the stage with Swift

Kanye West leaping on stage to hijack Swift’s win for best female video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards has gone down in pop culture history.

West grabbed the microphone and said, “Yo Taylor, I’m really happy for you. Imma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!”

The camera panned to Bey in the audience, looking flabbergasted.

Later, when Bey’s “Single Ladies” won for video of the year she brought Swift out to have the moment she had earlier been denied.

“I remember being 17 years old up for my first MTV Award with Destiny’s Child and it was one of the most exciting moments in my life,” Beyoncé said. “So I’d lke for Taylor to come out and have her moment.”

Afterwards Swift had nothing but praise for what she had done.

“They told me to stand by the side of the stage and I didn’t really know what was going to go down, but I thought it was so wonderful and gracious of her to do what she’s always done,” Rolling Stone reported Swift as saying at the time. “She’s always been a great person before anything else. Before the talented artist, the superstar, she’s always been a great person and I just, I thought I couldn’t love Beyoncé more tonight, then tonight happened and it was just wonderful.”

That love clearly couldn’t be more mutual.","['suggest', 'shes', 'artist', 'try', 'tour', 'women', 'taylor', 'beyoncé', 'grammy', 'won', 'person', 'swift', 'rivalry']","CNN —Beyoncé vs Taylor Swift is less about them than it is about a larger discussion about erasure and ethnicity.

400,Prevent injuries by avoiding these common exercise errors,"Editor’s note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.

CNN —

It’s a frustrating irony that exercise — so critical to good health and longevity — also has the potential to cause harm.

Some 3.6 million people were treated in emergency departments in 2022 for various injuries involving sports and recreational equipment, according to the National Safety Council. Topping the list? Injuries from exercise and exercise equipment, which accounted for 445,642 of those emergency department visits.

Whether you’re just starting out or rebooting a fitness routine, many injuries can be prevented with a little awareness and caution, according to experts.

“One of the biggest mistakes I see is doing too much, too soon,” said Dr. Alex McDonald, a family and sports medicine physician and assistant professor of clinical science at the Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine in Pasadena, California.

McDonald said such overexercising often occurs when someone decides to begin a new exercise regimen. “But they overestimate what they can do, then get injured or quit,” he said.

Exercising should be thought of as a long game, said Lisa Herrington, a certified personal trainer in Davis, California, and cofounder of Fit House Davis. “It should not be an all-or-nothing mentality,” she said. “A little every day goes a long way.”

Be mindful of form

Using proper form when exercising is also critical, whether you’re using a piece of gym equipment or engaging in activities such as running or cycling.

“Having good form always trumps speed, weight or strength,” McDonald said. “If you have bad form, you’re not getting the full benefit of the workout, and are potentially straining other muscles and ligaments that you’re not supposed to be using.”

One common example of bad form is hanging on, or leaning over, the handrails on treadmills and elliptical machines.

“People often hang on the handrails when they’re getting tired, instead of slowing down,” Herrington said. “But handrails are supposed to help with your workout, not be a rest aid. If you’re hanging on the equipment or leaning over the bars, back off the pace or incline.”

Herrington also frequently sees people leaning too hard on bike handlebars during the spin classes she teaches, which can result in sore necks and shoulders.

“People get tired during the sprints, so all of their body weight goes into the handlebars,” she said. “They should really take a seat for a few seconds and then sprint again.”

To ensure you’re using proper form, both McDonald and Herrington said it’s best to enlist the help of a professional, such as a personal trainer or physical therapist. They are the experts, plus it’s hard to evaluate yourself.

What’s more, you carry your body differently as you age. So even if your form was great several years ago, you may need some tweaks for the body you have today.

Cycling: Proper bike setup

Cycling may seem like a straightforward exercise, but it can cause injuries, too. A frequent misstep when cycling is having an incorrect seat height.

If your bike seat is too low or high, you may develop knee or lower-back pain, as your knee angle will be altered with each pedal stroke.

Your bike seat, or saddle, should be even with your hip bone when standing next to it.

When sitting on the bike and taking your feet off the pedals, your toes should be the only thing touching the floor.

Running: Don’t overdo it

Runners are at risk of goofs such as overstriding, poor gait and overtraining.

Overstriding, a common running error, occurs when you land with your foot too far in front of your hips or knees. Doing so puts you at risk for stress- and joint-related issues. Increasing your cadence, or the frequency of your steps, lowers the high impact of running, which may reduce injuries, according to a 2021 study. Greater step frequency also combats overstriding, as you have to take shorter steps.

To see if you may have gait issues, check the bottoms of your running shoes, McDonald said. If your heels or the outsides of your shoes are quite worn, it could indicate you’re landing too forcefully and frequently in less-optimal spots.

“A lot of running stores can video you running and do a gait analysis,” he said. “Physical therapists provide this service as well. Small tweaks in your gait can make a big difference when you’re talking about preventing a repetitive injury.”

Vary your movement

Overtraining involves performing the same motions over and over again, which can fatigue the body and make it susceptible to injury. Overtraining can also cause your fitness to plateau. So no matter your favorite activity, you should routinely mix things up.

“Try new machines at the gym,” Herrington said. “Take a group exercise class. Incorporate strength training exercises into cardiovascular routines.”

Developing a strong core is essential, too. “Core exercises strengthen the front and back of your body, improve your posture and help you move better,” she said.

Build your routine gradually

No matter what workout regimen you settle on, the key to staying healthy is to start slow and low. Increase the time or intensity of your workouts by just 10% per week, McDonald said, and never boost both the intensity and duration simultaneously.

Then, enjoy.

“The goal of regular exercise is to be able to move with comfort and ease for as long as we possibly can,” Herrington said. “Doing the right exercises for your body and mind, mixing up your routine every now and then, enlisting a professional when you need guidance, and choosing exercises that bring you joy are all important pieces to living a healthy life.”

401,"Teen tyrannosaur had a taste for baby dinos, rare fossil reveals","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Researchers have found a tyrannosaur’s last meal perfectly preserved inside its stomach cavity.

What was on the menu 75 million years ago? The hind legs of two baby dinosaurs, according to new research on the fossil published Friday in the journal Science Advances.

Dinosaur guts and hard evidence of their diets are rarely preserved in the fossil record, and it is the first time the stomach contents of a tyrannosaur have been uncovered.

The revelation makes this discovery particularly exciting, said co-lead author Darla Zelenitsky, a paleontologist and associate professor at the University of Calgary in Alberta.

“Tyrannosaurs are these large predatory species that roamed Alberta, and North America, during the late Cretaceous. These were the iconic apex or top predators that we’ve all seen in movies, books and museums. They walked on two legs (and) had very short arms,” Zelenitsky said.

“It was a cousin of T. rex, which came later in time, 68 to 66 million years ago. T. rex is the biggest of the tyrannosaurs, Gorgosaurus was a little bit smaller, maybe full grown would have been 9, 10 meters (33 feet).”

The tyrannosaur in question, a young Gorgosaurus libratus, would have weighed about 772 pounds (350 kilograms) — less than a horse — and reached 13 feet (4 meters) in length at the time of death.

The creature was between the ages of 5 and 7 and appeared to be picky in what it consumed, Zelenitsky said.

“Its last and second-to-last meal were these little birdlike dinosaurs, Citipes, and the tyrannosaur actually only ate the hind limbs of each of these prey items. There’s really no other skeletal remains of these predators within the stomach cavity. It’s just the hind legs.

“It must have killed … both of these Citipes at different times and then ripped off the hind legs and ate those and left the rest of the carcasses,” she added. “Obviously this teenager had an appetite for drumsticks.”

An illustration shows a Gorgosaurus libratus eating dinosaurs belonging to the species called Citipes elegans. Julius Csotonyi/Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology

The two baby dinosaurs both belonged to the species called Citipes elegans and would have been younger than 1 year old when the tyrannosaur hunted them down, the researchers determined.

The almost complete skeleton was found in Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park in 2009.

That the tyrannosaur’s stomach contents were preserved wasn’t immediately obvious, but staff at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta, noticed small protruding bones when preparing the fossil in the lab and removed a rock within its rib cage to take a closer look.

“Lo and behold, the complete hind legs of two baby dinosaurs, both under a year old, were present in its stomach,” said co-lead author François Therrien, the museum’s curator of dinosaur paleoecology, in a statement.

The paleontologists were able to determine the ages of both the predator and its prey by analyzing thin slices sampled from the fossilized bones.

“There’s growth marks like the rings of a tree. And we can essentially tell how old a dinosaur is from looking at those, the structure of the bone,” Zelenitsky said.

Changing appetites of top predators

The fossil is the first hard evidence of a long-suspected dietary pattern among large predatory dinosaurs, said paleoecologist Kat Schroeder, a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University’s department of Earth and planetary science, who wasn’t involved in the research.

The teen tyrannosaur didn’t eat what its parents did. Paleontologists believe its diet would have changed over its life span.

“Large, robust tyrannosaurs like T. rex have bite forces strong enough to hit bone when eating, and so we know they bit into megaherbivores like Triceratops,” Schroeder said via email. “Juvenile tyrannosaurs can’t bite as deep, and therefore don’t leave such feeding traces.”

She said that scientists have previously hypothesized that young tyrannosaurs had different diets from fully developed adults, but the fossil find marks the first time researchers have direct evidence.

“Combined with the relative rarity of juvenile tyrannosaur skeletons, this fossil is very significant,” Schroeder added. “Teeth can only tell us so much about the diet of extinct animals, so finding stomach contents is like picking up the proverbial ‘smoking gun.’”

The contents of the tyrannosaur’s stomach cavity revealed that at this stage in life, juveniles were hunting swift, small prey. It was likely because the predator’s body wasn’t yet well-suited for bigger prey, Zelenitsky said.

“It’s well known that tyrannosaurs changed a lot during growth, from slender forms to these robust, bone-crushing dinosaurs, and we know that this change was related to feeding behavior.”

When the dinosaur died, its mass was only 10% of that of an adult Gorgosaurus, she said.

How juvenile tyrannosaurs filled a niche

The voracious appetite of teenage tyrannosaurs and other carnivores has been thought to explain a puzzling feature of dinosaur diversity.

There are relatively few small and midsize dinosaurs in the fossil record, particularly in the Mid- to Late Cretaceous Period — something paleontologists have determined is due to the hunting activities of young tyrannosaurs.

“In Alberta’s Dinosaur Provincial Park, where this specimen is from, we have a very well sampled formation. And so we have a pretty good idea of the ecosystem there. Over 50 species of dinosaurs,” Zelenitsky said.

403,Tesla failed at battery swapping but Stellantis says it may have the secret,"CNN —

It can take 20 minutes to “fast charge” an electric car up to 80%. But what if you could just change the batteries like they were AAs in a toy, and be back on the road fully charged in a handful of minutes?

It seems like an obvious solution, but there have been some famous failures with battery swapping. A decade ago, Tesla announced it would build out a network of battery swapping stations that could change out Model S’s battery pack in 90 seconds. But like many of CEO Elon Musk’s publicly-announced ideas, it was later dropped with Musk claiming customers weren’t interested.

And in 2013, an Israeli company that promised battery swapping called Better Place went out of business after burning through $850 million in cash and deploying only about 1,000 cars, according to reports at the time.

But the idea has become a reality, again, at least in Asia. Chinese EV maker Nio has been offering battery swapping for its vehicles since 2019. Nio now claims to be the world’s largest operator of battery swapping technology having performed over 32 million battery swaps since then at more than 2,100 stations.

Now Stellantis, the global automaker that makes Jeep, Dodge and Fiat vehicles, is also trying out the idea on a small scale – with a crucial difference – in hopes of incorporating it in future EV models.

Stellantis is working with a company called Ample that has created a new battery swapping system it says can work in virtually any shape or size of vehicle. It says the system doesn’t require any automaker to alter its vehicle to fit a special battery pack.

With Ample’s system, the entire battery pack – which can weigh more than 1,000 pounds – doesn’t get replaced as a single unit. Instead, a number of individually sealed battery modules about the size of a desktop computer are taken out by automated machinery and replaced one by one. In this way, all the vehicle’s batteries can be quickly replaced in easily manageable chunks rather than in a single huge slab.

That means it might take five to, at most, 10 minutes to change batteries, depending on the size of the vehicle and how many modules there are, instead of the 90 seconds Musk had promised. But having separate small battery packs provides numerous advantages.

First, the equipment required to change the batteries can be small. Ample’s battery swap stations, which handle the work automatically, look like backyard sheds with an extra-thick wall. The wall is where the battery modules are stored and charged. There’s no need to dig a hole in the ground underneath the battery swapping station, either, as might be the case if the equipment needed to handle entire big, heavy battery packs.

Because the batteries don’t need high-powered DC fast charging – they have plenty of time to charge inside the hut wall – the battery swapping stations don’t require the kind of high-wattage power connections fast-charging stations do. That simplifies their installation, said Khaled Hassounah, founder and chief executive of Ample.

Also, the vehicle itself can be of any shape or size. An SUV, car or truck doesn’t need to be designed around an Ample battery pack. The battery modules fit into a container on the underside of the vehicle where a battery pack would usually go. The container is adapted to the size and shape of the vehicle. A large vehicle could simply hold more battery modules while a smaller vehicle would hold fewer of them.

Besides Stellantis, Ample is also working with heavy equipment maker Mitsubishi Fuso on a battery-swapping test with commercial trucks in Japan. In the United States, the system is being tested with a variety of different Uber vehicles around the San Francisco Bay area. Ample’s 12 battery-swapping stations in the Bay area are used “a few hundred” times a day, according to the company.

The Ample battery modules can still be charged in the vehicle at a regular EV charger, so drivers would have the option of either plugging in or swapping batteries depending on the situation. As usual, most EV owners could still plug their cars in overnight at home.

Stellantis has not said it will necessarily incorporate the system into its EV models for sale around the world. Next year, Stellantis will use the Ample battery swap system in a fleet of 100 Fiat 500e electric cars in Spain that are part of the company’s Free2Move car-sharing service.

The Fiat 500e, a tiny electric car with a range of about 150 miles, provides a perfect test case for battery swapping, said Ricardo Stamatti-Avila, Stellantis’s vice president for charging and energy.

“If you want to extend the range of a car, the answer right now is you just throw more batteries at it,” he said. “But when you have limited real estate, like in a Fiat 500, that means we’d need to make the car bigger, and then it’s not a Fiat 500 anymore, right?”

Even with larger vehicles, Ample’s battery swapping system could free drivers from having to buy lots of extra battery power they might only rarely use, as they do now. Customers could just rent the extra battery packs they need for the occasional long trip, said Stamatti-Avila.

If the system works well in Spain, he said, Stellantis will look first to commercial fleet customers to start building up an infrastructure of swapping stations. Ordinary retail customers could start using the system once there are a good number of swapping stations available.

On the other hand, if Stellantis’s Spanish experiment doesn’t pan out, this whole battery-swapping thing might just never be talked about again, as happened with Tesla.","['batteries', 'system', 'failed', 'vehicle', 'stellantis', 'battery', 'modules', 'ample', 'size', 'stations', 'swapping', 'vehicles', 'secret', 'tesla']","It seems like an obvious solution, but there have been some famous failures with battery swapping.

404,"Could the most magical time of year be so full of loneliness, anger and stress?","Editor’s note: Dr. Neha Chaudhary is a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and chief medical officer at Modern Health.

CNN —

As the holiday season approaches, many conjure up images of the perfect gathering: comforting aromas of home-cooked feasts, harmonious laughter between friends and family, and thoughts of gratitude that easily roll off the tongue.

But for some people, this time of year feels like the exact opposite. It’s a time of stress, emotional turmoil or intense loneliness that looks nothing like the traditional celebration of togetherness.

Sixty-six percent of people report feeling lonely at the holidays, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, while 64% of people with mental illness say that the holidays make their condition worse. And as a child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist, I see these issues firsthand all too often.

Why are loneliness and emotional distress so common this time of year? Some people may be living far from family or may not be able to afford to travel to see them. Others may be grieving the loss of loved ones or navigating strained relationships — and the holidays can serve as a rude reminder of those losses. And for some, the holiday season brings families together who would rather be apart. Whatever the cause, the impact of the holidays on our mental health can be profound.

If this sounds like you, you’re clearly not alone. And if your experience at this time of year is the exact opposite, remember that your friends, colleagues or strangers may be having a hard time at the holidays.

Understanding and navigating loneliness

While the holiday season is portrayed as a time for family and social gatherings, that expectation can inadvertently amplify feelings of isolation. That’s true not only for those who find themselves alone, but also for those who are surrounded by loved ones.

The problem is loneliness is killing us — literally. According to the US surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, loneliness is as bad for your health as is smoking every day. It can increase your risk of mental health conditions, stroke, heart disease and even premature death.

Fortunately, there are ways to tackle the feeling. If you’ve been feeling lonely this holiday season, the first thing you can do is recognize and name it. Let the feeling roll in as if it’s a fleeting moment that will pass. If you try to resist a feeling, usually it will push back, staying longer than its welcome. If you allow the feeling to float on through you, it can float away just as easily as it came.

Next, see if you can pinpoint the source of the feeling. Do the holidays remind you of the loss of a loved one, or are they connected to a negative experience from your childhood? Or is it that you find yourself comparing yourself with others, only to feel like you aren’t measuring up to your own expectations, set by social comparison?

Once you identify the trigger for the emotion, you can try to talk to yourself about it with compassion as if you would talk to a friend. Remind yourself that it’s OK to grieve. Tell yourself that comparison is a distraction and put aside your social media. Or remind yourself that you can make investments in relationships if you really want to — you do have some control.

Lastly, find ways for connection with others in the moment. Is there a friend you haven’t texted in a while? A group activity you could join that leaves you with a sense of community? If you don’t have existing connections to turn to, having a brief interaction with a stranger can work as well. Chat with someone outside of your home or better yet offer to help or give something to a stranger. The sense of connection it can foster may surprise you. And it’s good for your health.

Gratitude, reflection and … anger?

While the focus of this time of year tends to be around reflection and gratitude, for some people it brings on a completely different feeling: anger. Anger toward family members who, when brought together, bring unresolved tensions up to the surface as a group. Anger toward loved ones who bailed on them many years ago. Or anger about life not going according to plan.

Sound like you? If so, put aside your self-judgment and let yourself feel. And then do something about it. What are ways you can share your anger that are respectful and constructive? Is there a conversation you can have with a loved one to work through hurt feelings from the past? If that doesn’t feel doable, consider writing your feelings down in a letter that you may never give the other person. Sometimes the act of getting it out of your brain and down on paper can feel like a welcome release. You can tear up the letter and throw it in the trash or flush it down the toilet, picturing the anger leaving you as you destroy the letter itself.

Handling the stress and pressure

Navigating the expectations and pressures set by society (and yourself) around the holidays can be similar to walking a tightrope. Whether it’s the expertly roasted turkey or picture-perfect family gatherings, idealized holiday movie and social media images can create a sense of pressure that might overshadow the essence of gratitude and togetherness. Ultimately, these unrealistic standards often lead to unnecessary stress and a sense of inadequacy for many people.

To break yourself out of the trap of comparison and never-ending expectations, start by acknowledging that perfection is an elusive goal and not the point of the holidays. Embrace imperfections. Try out new rituals and routines that are relaxed, goofy and inconsistent year to year, just for the sake of having fun.

Set boundaries with family and friends who have high expectations of you, whether it’s your aunt’s commentary on what you should wear to dinner, your mother’s criticism of your cooking, or your father-in-law’s comments about how you should be spending more time with that side of the family than you are. Practice in advance what you’re going to say to people when they push your boundaries.

The holiday blues

This holiday season is going to be hard for a lot of people, for a lot of different reasons. If uncomfortable feelings arise for you this holiday, I encourage you to hold space for them.

If you’re feeling low, give yourself a pass and turn your focus to ways you can take care of yourself and your mental health, whether it’s curling up under a blanket and binge-watching movies, writing in a journal, listening to music, expressing yourself through art or calling an old friend. Recognize what you need to survive this moment. And if nothing else is working, turn to a professional for help.

For many people, it will be the most wonderful time of the year. For others, it won’t. The more we encourage a culture of empathy and understanding around all the emotions that come with the holidays, the more we can strengthen our communities and lift each other up when it matters. And this might be one of the times of year that it matters most.

405,"In Miami Beach, a new street art installation celebrates the city’s vibrant drag scene","CNN —

The newest work of public art in Miami Beach, Florida, is an ode to drag. On Tuesday, city officials unveiled “Adora Vanessa Athena Fantasia,” a vibrant series of aluminum panels suspended over a block of the bustling Española Way shopping district. Each panel features a kaleidoscopic portrait inspired by local drag queens (including the four who inspired its title: Adora, Athena Dion, Fantasia Royale and Tiffany Fantasia), and is accompanied by a 30-foot-tall mural of dramatic manicures, doll-like eyelashes and full, pouty lips.

These quintessential elements in the art of drag come together as “a costume, a work outfit and a kind of armor in one,” said Persephone Von Lips, one of eleven queens who inspired the installation. “The hair, the makeup, the nails, the whole getup — when I put them on, I can walk down any street and feel the most beautiful and most confident I’ve ever been.”

“Adora Vanessa Athena Fantasia” is a work by Assume Vivid Astro Focus, or AVAF, an artist collective known for its multidisciplinary installations and psychedelic explosions of color. The City of Miami Beach commissioned the piece as the latest installment of Elevate Española, a semi-annual public art project launched in 2021.

Eli Sudbrack, the Brazilian artist who founded AVAF in New York some 20 years ago, wanted to pay tribute to Miami Beach’s bustling drag scene. He was motivated in large part by a law that Florida governor and Republican presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis signed in April, which sought to limit drag performances in the state.

Named the “Protection of Children Act” by its sponsors, the law threatened venues that admitted children into “adult live performances” — a phrase widely understood to mean drag — with fines, misdemeanor charges or revoked liquor licenses. In June, a district judge temporarily blocked the law on grounds that it would “suppress the speech of drag queen performers,” and the US Supreme Court declined the state’s request for a partial stay in November. Still, attorneys for the DeSantis administration are seeking to overturn the law’s temporary block in federal appeals court.

""Energizing the viewer always seems to be the intention of drag performances and that is also an important feature in our work,"" explained AVAF's Eli Sudbrack in a statement. City of Miami Beach Communications Department

Across the US, where at least a dozen other states have attempted to pass similar laws, drag remains a central topic in a larger culture war targeting LGBTQ rights.

“There’s still a fear in the back of our heads: What are they going to do next?” said Von Lips. Historically, the drag community has given refuge to trans and queer people rejected by society or their families, she added, “and I just think it’s insane that people are trying to take that away from us.”

The spectacle of drag

After AVAF was chosen for the Elevate Española commission earlier this year, the New York-based Sudbrack began his research online, reaching out to Tiffany Fantasia, a veteran on the Miami drag scene, to learn more about the local community. The artist also asked a friend in Miami to send him a list of iconic performers from both the South Beach and Downtown Miami scenes, which ultimately included the aforementioned queens, as well as Karla Croqueta, Juice Love Dion, Lady Paraiso, Power Infiniti, Regina Black and TP Lords.

Looking to the queens’ Instagrams for reference, Sudbrack said, “I started making drawings out of details of their personas: (the) makeup, lipstick, wigs and nails, so that the central panels are a mixture of different drag queens put together as a super powerful image.” The composite portraits of each panel represent the overall community rather than individuals, energized by the psychedelic hues and patterns for which AVAF is known.

Sudbrack’s mural, meanwhile, used the colors of the Progress Pride flag as its palette. The piece zooms in on features of individual queens — the faces of Athena Dion and TP Lords; the manicured hands of Regina Black, for example — rendering them in a cartoonish style of graphic outlines.

“It was very important, if I’m going to do a project in Miami right now, to honor this practice, no matter what,” Sudbrack said. “Our own practice has always been about self-expression and freedom, and the artistry of drag is about that — to be whoever you want to be.”

Lissette Garcia Arrogante, director of tourism and culture for the City of Miami Beach, said AVAF was an ideal choice for the commission, citing “all the vibrancy and vitality of the colors in their work.”

“Miami Beach proudly stands as one of the world’s most welcoming LGBTQ destinations, where the drag scene thrives despite Florida’s misguided efforts,” added Miami Beach Commissioner Alex Fernandez, reflecting on the work’s content. “We emphatically ‘elevate’ and celebrate diversity, resisting any attempts to dim our community’s spirit.”

Despite the governor’s efforts, Tiffany Fantasia said she’s confident in her right to remain in drag. “Anything is possible with these extreme Republicans, but we all know at the end of the day, it is not constitutional for them to do this type of stuff,” she said. “It’s a violation of freedom of expression”

407,These ‘dome homes’ made from soil mix tradition and innovation,"CNN —

In Morocco, a startup is building affordable homes using a material that is ubiquitous: soil.

Eco-dôme Maroc was founded in 2016. It applies local traditions to modern technology to construct dome-shaped buildings that it says are cheaper, more environmentally sustainable and more energy-efficient than regular concrete homes.

Founder Youness Ouazri says he discovered “a very rich tradition of earthen construction” used by previous generations while he was traveling around the country.

“We simply took this existing know-how and adjusted it to modern technologies to come up with a concept that is eco-friendly, cost effective and very rapid to implement,” he tells CNN.

Each home Eco-dôme builds is unique. Once the company receives an order, the first step is to analyze the soil composition on site to determine its suitability for construction.

Small quantities of lime or cement can be added for optimal performance, and thermal simulation models are run to ascertain the ideal thickness of the dome’s walls, so that it can absorb heat during the summer and release it during the winter. That means the building will use as little energy as possible for heating and cooling — sometimes none at all, says Ouazri, who trained as a civil engineer.

He adds that the eco-domes are much faster to build than a standard home. Prices range from around 2,500 Moroccan dirhams ($247) per square meter to 4,500 dirhams ($445), and can vary according to the soil and site. Ouazri says that can be a third cheaper than a standard home “mainly because we eliminate a big part of the raw materials that we’d need to acquire, since we are using local soil. We also eliminate the logistics associated with that, such as transporting materials to the site.”

Eco-dôme builds the homes using different techniques. One is called “superadobe,” which was devised in the 1980s by Iranian American architect Nader Khalili, and uses stacked polypropylene bags filled with soil. Other methods include using a wooden frame for the structures to obtain a rectangular, rather than round, floorplan.

An Eco-dôme building in northern Morocco. Eco-dôme Maroc

The first Eco-dôme was completed in 2017. “It was a 775-square-feet house in a rural area near Rabat, the Moroccan capital, built for a client that uses it as a holiday house,” Ouazri says.

Since then, the company has built more than 100 domes across 40 different sites. The largest is a 2,700-square-foot cultural center in Agouim, 70 miles south-east of Marrakech, in an area with a harsh climate that swings from below freezing in winter to scorching hot in the summer.

‘Frugal innovation’

The company, which has received around $300,000 in investment to date and employs 17 people, has three main types of client, Ouazri says: “Land owners who want to build a primary or secondary home in the most ecological way possible; investors in rural tourism and eco-tourism; and local authorities and communities, to build schools or other infrastructure for education and healthcare.”

Eco-dôme now aims to start building in other countries and is looking at Tunisia and the Ivory Coast first.

Youssef El Ganadi, a professor of architecture at the International University of Rabat, who is not affiliated with Eco-dôme, says the project is an interesting “frugal innovation,” meant to make affordable homes for all social categories, and adds that it is sustainable.

However, he believes the uptake of the homes has been limited by a cultural barrier.

“Here in Morocco and in North Africa in general, many people have a mentality of wanting homes made of concrete, which they believe are more modern and robust,” he says. “That has limited the project to a niche, favored mainly by those with a certain sensibility to environmental causes and particularly for second homes.”

Ganadi also questions the earthquake resistance of superadobe domes. In September, Morocco was hit with a devastating quake that killed almost 3,000 people.

Ouzrai says attitudes are slowly changing. He adds that the Eco-dômes are built in compliance with local construction regulations, saying “buildings using superadobe or other earthen techniques are resilient to earthquakes” and that “four of our buildings were nearby the epicenter of the earthquake and stood still in front of it.”

“[Earth] lasts longer than industrialized materials,” Ouzrai says. “In certain regions in Morocco, we have buildings that were made thousands of years ago. With the appropriate maintenance, our domes can last forever.”

408,Pompeii archaeologists uncover bakery that doubled as prison,"Rome CNN —

An ancient bakery operated by slaves has been discovered in the ruins of Pompeii, the Pompeii Archaeological Park said in a statement released Friday.

Enslaved people and donkeys were locked up together and used to power a mill to grind grain for bread, according to details of the discovery provided by the park.

The site consists of a narrow room with no external view but only small, high windows covered by bars through which minimal light passed. There were also indentations in the floor “to coordinate the movement of the animals, forced to walk around for hours, blindfolded,” the statement said.

The discovery was made in the Regio IX section of the popular tourist site, which is also an ongoing archaeological dig. The area is currently being excavated as part of a larger project designed to secure and maintain previously excavated areas of the Roman city.

Archaeologists discovered the bakery while excavating an ancient Pompeiian home that was being renovated when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 C.E., covering the city of Pompeii with ash.

The bodies of three victims of the eruption were found in recent months, believed to be residents of the home rather than slaves. The house was divided into a residential section with “refined frescoes” on one side, and a commercial bakery on the other.

Next to the bakery was the dimly lit prison area, Pompeii Archaeological Park director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said in an interview posted on the site’s YouTube channel.

“What has emerged is testimony of the backbreaking work to which men, women, and animals were subjected in the ancient mill-bakeries,” he added.

Zuchtriegel said these prison bakeries were previously described by the Roman writer Apuleius in the 2nd century C.E., in his novel “Metamorphoses” (also known as “The Golden Ass”), in which the protagonist, Lucius, “transformed into a donkey and was sold to a miller.” Zuchtriegel said the episode was based on the writer’s direct knowledge of the animals and humans living and working together.

The prison area had no doors to the outside world. Parco Archeologico Di Pompei/Reuters

The newly discovered prison area had no doors to the outside, only to the inner atrium.

“It is, in other words, a space in which we must imagine the presence of people of servile status whose owner felt the need to limit the freedom of movement,” Zuchtriegel said.

“It is the most shocking side of ancient slavery, the side devoid of relationships of trust, where it was reduced to brute violence, an impression which is fully confirmed by the closing of the few windows with iron grates.”

Archaeologists also believe that the indentations in the slab flooring were not made by repetitive movement but were carved to prevent the donkeys and other animals from slipping on the pavement and to force them to only walk in a circular motion to grind the grain, almost like a clockwork mechanism.

“The iconographic and literary sources, in particular the reliefs from the tomb of Eurysaces in Rome, suggest that a millstone was normally moved by a couple made up of a donkey and a slave,” Zuchtriegel said.

“The latter, in addition to pushing the grindstone, had the task of encouraging the animal and monitoring the grinding process, adding grain and removing flour.”

The site will complement an exhibition that opens December 15, called “The Other Pompeii: common lives in the shadow of Vesuvius,” which is dedicated to what Zuchtriegel calls the “myriad of individuals often forgotten by historical chronicles, such as the slaves, who constituted the majority of the population and whose work contributed significantly to the economy, but also to the culture and social fabric of Roman civilization.”","['site', 'animals', 'area', 'prison', 'ancient', 'slaves', 'roman', 'archaeologists', 'uncover', 'zuchtriegel', 'pompeii', 'bakery', 'doubled']","Rome CNN —An ancient bakery operated by slaves has been discovered in the ruins of Pompeii, the Pompeii Archaeological Park said in a statement released Friday.

CNN —

In a court in Harris County, Texas, something remarkable happened this week: A woman and her husband asked a judge for an emergency order granting her permission to end a pregnancy.

Mary Zeigler Bill Lax/Bill Lax/FSU Photography Service

Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, had learned that the child she was carrying had full trisomy 18, a rare genetic condition that is almost always fatal. Her physicians have warned that continuing the pregnancy could put her at risk for life-threatening complications. Cox, who wants to have a third child, might also lose her ability to do so if forced to carry the pregnancy to term.

The judge granted Cox’s request on Thursday, but the state will almost certainly appeal to what is a Texas Supreme Court with nine Republican members. Late Friday, the Texas Supreme Court temporarily blocked the lower court’s ruling. But regardless of what happens next, Cox’s suit will shape the abortion debate going forward — not least because it is historic.

Cox is part of a new generation of plaintiffs telling heartbreaking stories about their experiences under criminal laws in places such as Texas, Idaho, Tennessee and Oklahoma — plaintiffs willing to speak out in a climate where support for abortion is at a record high, according to a WSJ-NORC poll, and some of the stigma surrounding abortion seems less intense. But given the popularity of abortion rights — and the obvious tragedy faced by women like Cox — why are states like Texas fighting so hard to defend their narrow exceptions?

The answer is that Cox’s case and others like it expose how unworkable abortion exceptions are under current law in states with virtual bans, especially when they are attached to harsh penalties like life in prison. Conceding that a woman like Cox is right could threaten to send much else about criminal abortion laws toppling down.

It is worth remarking on how rare Cox’s suit is. Before Roe v. Wade, patients and doctors both questioned the constitutionality of abortion laws. In some cases, pregnant patients were named plaintiffs: This was the case for Norma McCorvey, the “Roe” in Roe v. Wade, and Sandra Cano, the plaintiff in Roe’s companion case, Doe v. Bolton. These suits adjudicated whether a law was permissible, but often did not change what happened to a particular pregnant plaintiff (McCorvey, for example, famously carried what some called the “Roe baby” to term). After Roe, minors acting without parental consent or notification sought court-ordered abortion under what were called “judicial bypass” laws, often also while maintaining anonymity.

Cox’s case is quite different. She is an adult, not a minor, and she has not concealed her identity. Her willingness to tell her story is no doubt due to her own strength and commitment, but our present political moment likely has something to do with it too. Poll after poll find strong, if not unprecedented, support for legal abortion, even in states where abortion bans are already in effect. Backlash to these bans — and to the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization — has made it easier for other women to describe their own experiences with criminal laws and to file suits of their own.

McCorvey and Cano used pseudonyms at a time when pursuing abortion rights might have come at great personal and political cost. Women like Cox and Amanda Zurawski, who is challenging the validity of Texas’s medical emergency exception to abortion, use their own names, and do so with the knowledge that most Americans support legal abortion — and all the more so in cases like theirs.

When states fight plaintiffs like Cox and Zurawski in court, it hardly helps Republicans already on the defensive about abortion. It is comparably easy to paint bans as heartless and extreme when the state shows no sympathy for women who stand to lose their fertility, health or lives.

Suits like Cox’s expose how hard it would be to devise a workable abortion exception. In theory, a functioning exception would advance the state’s interest in fetal life while offering a real opportunity for people in exceptional cases that the state deems deserving. But if a state requires harsh punishment — Texas, for example, authorizes life in prison for abortion — few doctors will be willing to gamble that they are interpreting the law correctly, even if an exception is relatively clear.

Most exceptions, it turns out, aren’t clear anyway, written not by physicians but by lawmakers who use the language of criminal law, and sometimes write more than one exception into various criminal abortion laws, as in Oklahoma. The broader and more compassionate a state makes an exception, the higher the odds that more plaintiffs like Cox will prevail, but that will require deference to patients and physicians that anti-abortion states focused on punishing abortion providers reject as a matter of principle.

Exceptions almost always leave out other tragic circumstances. Texas has a medical emergency exception, but dismisses a fatal fetal abnormality that could deprive Cox of the ability to have a third child as nothing different than what is experienced by “countless women who give birth every day.” The risk of death, the state says, is simply “not imminent” enough. Andy Beshear, the Democratic governor of Kentucky, just made anger about a similar provision in his state’s law a central message of his successful reelection campaign.

Republican lawmakers often seem to want it both ways on abortion. They define themselves as pro-life but insist on compassion for women, especially in the so-called hard cases like Cox’s.

But what is happening in Texas complicates that narrative. Texas purports to value fetal life and women’s health — but then denies that the unborn have rights when that strategy will help defeat a lawsuit brought by a prison employee forced to stay at her post who lost her pregnancy. Texas claims compassion for women but requires that their lives or a major bodily function be at imminent risk before a doctor can step in. And Texas claims to protect life by forcing a woman like Cox to carry a child who almost certainly won’t live while threatening her ability to have a child who will.

All of this is a reminder of the priorities of state abortion laws, which are not about the value of life in the womb, but about criminal punishment — and about crafting exceptions that will rarely, if ever, be used. Cox’s suit matters because it is historic, but also because of what it tells us. When the chips are down, given a choice between protecting women like Cox and criminalizing those who offer abortions, we know what states like Texas will choose every time.","['exposing', 'exception', 'laws', 'truth', 'texas', 'states', 'women', 'opinion', 'life', 'law', 'chilling', 'woman', 'abortion', 'cox', 'state', 'roe']","Conceding that a woman like Cox is right could threaten to send much else about criminal abortion laws toppling down.

411,‘Turtwig’ ancient turtle species discovered after fossil mystery solved,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

Ancient plant fossils that puzzled scientists have turned out not to be plants after all, new research has revealed.

Instead, the small round shapes bearing a leaflike pattern were once the shells of baby turtles that lived during the time of dinosaurs. Scientists have nicknamed the turtle species “Turtwig,” after a Pokémon character that is half-turtle, half-plant.

The discovery marks the first time baby turtle carapaces have been found in northwestern South America, according to the study authors.

The results of their research were published Thursday in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.

“In the Pokémon universe, you encounter the concept of combining two or more elements, such as animals, machines, plants, etc.,” said lead author Héctor Palma-Castro, a graduate student of paleobotany at the National University of Colombia, in a statement.

“So, when you have a fossil initially classified as a plant that turns out to be a baby turtle, a few Pokémon immediately come to mind. In this case, Turtwig, a baby turtle with a leaf attached to its head.”

But it took some sleuthing to solve this paleontological mystery that began decades ago.

Wrong place, wrong time

It all started when Colombian priest Padre Gustavo Huertas discovered the fossils in the Paja Formation. The formation is part of one of Colombia’s geological heritage sites called the Marine Reptile Lagerstätte of the Ricaurte Alto.

Previous fossil discoveries from the site include dinosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, ichthyosaurs, turtles and crocodile relatives called crocodylopmorphs dated from the Early Cretaceous Period, between 113 million and 132 million years ago.

Huertas collected fossils and rocks at the site, near the town of Villa de Leyva, from the 1950s to the 1970s. When he found the leaf-patterned rocks, he deemed them a fossil plant. Huertas went on to describe the specimens as Sphenophyllum colombianum in a 2003 study.

But other scientists were surprised to hear that the plant was discovered in northern South America and dated between 113 million and 132 million years ago. The now-extinct plant, once prevalent around the world, died out more than 100 million years earlier, according to the fossil record.

Previous research about the plant showed that its leaves were typically wedge-shaped with veins that radiated out from the base of the leaf.

The age and location of the fossils intrigued Palma-Castro and Fabiany Herrera, the assistant curator of paleobotany at the Negaunee Integrative Research Center at Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History.

Herrera collects and studies plants from the Early Cretaceous Period (100.5 million to 145 million years ago) in northwestern South America, a part of the continent where little paleobotanical research takes place.

Both fossils, about 2 inches (5 centimeters) in diameter, were housed in collections at the National University of Colombia’s department of geosciences. As Herrera and Palma-Castro examined and photographed the fossils, they thought something seemed strange.

“When you look at it in detail, the lines seen on the fossils don’t look like the veins of a plant — I was positive that it was most likely bone,” said Herrera, the study’s senior author, in a statement.

Solving a fossil mystery

Herrera contacted his colleague Edwin-Alberto Cadena, a senior lecturer and paleontologist who studies turtles and other vertebrates at Del Rosario University in Bogotá, Colombia.

“They sent me the photos, and I said, ‘This definitely looks like a carapace’ — the bony upper shell of a turtle,” said Cadena, a study coauthor, in a statement. “I said, ‘Well, this is remarkable, because this is not only a turtle, but it’s also a hatchling specimen, it’s very, very small.’”

Cadena and one of his students, Diego Cómbita-Romero at the National University of Colombia, compared the fossils with the shells of other extinct and modern turtles.

“When we saw the specimen for the first time I was astonished, because the fossil was missing the typical marks on the outside of a turtle’s shell,” said study coauthor Cómbita-Romero in a statement. “It was a little bit concave, like a bowl. At that moment we realized that the visible part of the fossil was the other side of the carapace, we were looking at the part of the shell that is inside the turtle.”

During their analysis of the shells, the researchers determined that the turtles were about 1 year old at the most when they died.

As young turtles develop, their growth rates and sizes can vary, Cómbita-Romero said. But it’s rare to find remains of young turtles because the bones in their shells are so thin.

“These turtles were likely relatives of other Cretaceous species that were up to fifteen feet long, but we don’t know much about how they actually grew to such giant sizes,” Cadena said in a statement.

The researchers didn’t blame Huertas for mistakenly categorizing the fossils as plants. What he believed to be leaves and stems were the vertebrae and rib bones within a turtle’s shell.

“We resolved a small paleobotanical mystery, but more importantly, this study shows the need to re-study historical collections in Colombia. The Early Cretaceous is a critical time in land plant evolution,” Herrera said.

The research team next aims to uncover the forests that once grew in the region, he said.

“In paleontology, your imagination and capacity to be amazed are always put to the test,” Palma-Castro said. “Discoveries like these are truly special because they not only expand our knowledge about the past but also open a window to the diverse possibilities of what we can uncover.”","['turtles', 'plant', 'million', 'shells', 'species', 'university', 'solved', 'fossils', 'turtwig', 'ancient', 'fossil', 'discovered', 'mystery', 'study', 'turtle', 'research']","CNN —Ancient plant fossils that puzzled scientists have turned out not to be plants after all, new research has revealed.

412,Woman who threw bowl of food at Chipotle worker sentenced to work 2 months in fast food job,"New York CNN —

A woman who threw a bowl of hot food in the face of a Chipotle worker has been sentenced to a month in jail — and two months working a fast food job.

Videos of the woman, Rosemary Hayne, berating Chipotle worker Emily Russell on September 5 and then throwing the food in her face at close range, went viral after the incident. Hayne, a 39-year old mother of four, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge and received the sentence last week in the Parma, Ohio, municipal court. Judge Timothy Gilligan gave her the choice of a 90-day jail sentence or a 30-day sentence on top of 60 days working in a fast food job.

“Do you want to walk in her shoes for two months and learn how people should treat people, or do you want to do your jail time?” Gilligan asked Hayne at the hearing.

“I’d like to walk in her shoes,” Hayne responded.

Hayne has yet to find the job, Gilligan and her attorney told CNN on Wednesday. Her attorney, Joseph O’Malley, said his client had no criminal record before the incident and that she is truly sorry for her actions that day.

“Let’s give her the opportunity to not let this one day define the rest of her life,” he told CNN.

Gilligan said Hayne will have to have her job approved by the court, and will have to work there 20 hours a week. O’Malley said Hayne does not currently have a job.

Gilligan told CNN he thought about the possible unusual sentence a couple of days before the November hearing.

“Every time you watch the video, it makes you more and more upset,” he said. “I was thinking, ‘What else can I do rather than just have her sit in jail.’”

Asked if he would want to hire Hayne if he ran a fast food restaurant, the judge said he doesn’t think she’ll have trouble finding a job.

“I don’t see her as any greater risk than anyone who walks in off the street,” he said. “I looked at it as someone who lost her cool.”

Gilligan said it’s the first time he’s handed down this kind of sentence, but unfortunately it’s the not the first incident of this kind to come before him. He said there was one case a couple of years ago in which a customer who didn’t get a cookie in a Happy Meal at a McDonald’s reached through the drive-thru window and started punching a worker. That defendant got 90 days in jail, he said.

“I see these cases more than I want to,” said Gilligan, who has been a judge for 30 years.

Asked for a comment on the case, Chipotle responded: “The health and safety of our employees is our greatest priority, and we’re pleased to see justice served for any individual that does not treat our team members with the respect they deserve.”

Hayne declined a request for an interview made through O’Malley. Russell told the court that she is still dealing with stress from the incident, and that she quit the job at Chipotle after the attack and found another job. She said she would like to begin counseling to deal with the trauma she is still experiencing from the attack.

One of Russell’s friends started a fundraising effort on social media for her and it has raised $7,300 so far, with most of that money coming since the first news reports about Hayne’s sentence last week. Russell told WJW in Cleveland that she was pleased with Hayne’s sentence.

“She’s going to get what she deserves,” she told the station. “She didn’t get a slap on the wrist. She’s going to learn to work in fast food, and hopefully it will be good.”

In addition to the jail time and time spent working in fast food, Hayne will have to pay a $250 fine and will be on probation for two years. Gilligan told CNN he’s not sure Hayne is as sorry as she claimed to be in court, pointing out that she was still complaining about the food during the hearing.

“She still has not picked up that this is not appropriate,” Gilligan told CNN Wednesday.

“You didn’t get your burrito bowl the way you like it, and this is how you respond?” he told Hayne during the hearing. He suggested she’s not going to be happy with the food she’s about to get in jail.","['fast', 'job', 'jail', 'food', 'cnn', 'months', 'woman', 'chipotle', 'hayne', 'work', 'worker', 'threw', 'told', 'gilligan', 'sentenced', 'incident', 'sentence']","New York CNN —A woman who threw a bowl of hot food in the face of a Chipotle worker has been sentenced to a month in jail — and two months working a fast food job.

413,"Harvard, Penn and MIT presidents under fire over ‘despicable’ testimony on antisemitism and genocide","New York CNN —

The presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania faced intense scrutiny on Wednesday from business leaders, donors and politicians following their testimony at a House hearing on antisemitism on campus and calls for genocide in Israel.

The criticism focused on the university leaders’ answers to questions on Tuesday about whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates their respective school’s code of conduct on bullying or harassment.

None of the school leaders explicitly said that calling for the genocide of Jews would necessarily violate their code of conduct. Instead, they explained it would depend on the circumstances and conduct.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a post on X he was “ashamed” to hear the testimony, calling it “one of the most despicable moments in the history of US academia.”

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, speaking outside a falafel shop in Philadelphia that had been targeted by protesters, called Penn President Liz Magill’s statements “unacceptable” and “shameful.”

Shapiro called for the UPenn board of trustees to meet and discuss whether Magill’s testimony represents the values of the university and board.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told CNN’s MJ Lee Wednesday that calls for genocide at universities were “unacceptable.”

Private equity billionaire Marc Rowan wrote a message to Penn trustees saying he heard from hundreds of alumni, parents and leaders who were shocked by the hearing, including at least one who hoped the hearing was fake.

“Unfortunately, this is not fake and the University is suffering tremendous reputational damage,” Rowan wrote in the message, obtained by CNN. “How much damage to our reputation are we willing to accept?”

Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman called for Harvard President Claudine Gay, MIT President Sally Kornbluth and the University of Pennsylvania’s President Liz Magill to “resign in disgrace,” citing disgust with their testimony.

“Throughout the hearing, the three behaved like hostile witnesses,” Ackman wrote in a post on X, “exhibiting a profound disdain for the Congress with their smiles and smirks, and their outright refusal to answer basic questions with a yes or no answer.”

Ackman, a Harvard graduate who has been a vocal critic of how universities have addressed antisemitism, posted a clip from the exchange at the hearing where the university leaders were asked about calls for the genocide of Jews.

“They must all resign in disgrace. If a CEO of one of our companies gave a similar answer, he or she would be toast within the hour,” Ackman said on X. “The answers they gave reflect the profound moral bankruptcy of Presidents Gay, Magill and Kornbluth.”

In response to Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik asking whether calling for the genocide of Jews would violate Penn’s code of conduct, Penn President Magill said: “It is a context dependent decision.”

Stefanik responded with shock.

“That’s your testimony today? Calling for the genocide of Jews is dependent on the context? That is not bullying or harassment? This is the easiest question to answer yes for,” Stefanik said.

Ackman strongly criticized the response.

“Why has antisemitism exploded on campus and around the world? Because of leaders like Presidents Gay, Magill and Kornbluth who believe genocide depends on the context,” Ackman said.

The criticism of the university leaders was so strong that Harvard and Penn felt compelled to issue new statements attempting to clarify the testimony.

“There are some who have confused a right to free expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for violence against Jewish students,” Gay said in the new statement posted on X. “Let me be clear: Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.”

In a short video released Wednesday night, Magill echoed Gay’s response and said the university would immediately review and clarify its policies on hate speech.

“I was not focused on – but I should have been – the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It’s evil. Plain, and simple,” Magill said in a video posted on X. “I want to be clear: A call for genocide of Jewish people … would be harassment or intimidation.”

Magill noted antisemitic speech is designed to threaten and terrify Jews and remind them of the Holocaust, pogroms and other recent acts of violence against them.

“As president, I’m committed to a safe, secure and supportive environment so all members of our community can thrive,” Magill added. “We can – and we will – get this right.”

Representatives at MIT were not immediately available to respond to the criticism.

Condemning Harvard but forgiving Musk

Ackman has been publicly feuding with Harvard’s administration and some students over reports of rising antisemitism on campus. In an open letter last month, he said Harvard’s lack of action to rein in antisemitism threatened its funding from donors. And he called on the university to publicly name students who were members of student groups that blamed Israel for Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.

However, Ackman has gone easy on fellow billionaire Elon Musk, who endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X, leading to a revolt from advertisers. Ackman defended Musk in a post on X last week, saying, “After examining the facts, it was clear to me that Musk did not have antisemitic intent” when Musk said a conspiracy theory that Jews were trying to replace White people with immigrants was “the actual truth.”

Musk has since apologized for his post, calling it his “worst” and “dumbest” social media post.

The White House weighs in

The White House issued a full-throated condemnation of any calls for genocide Wednesday, just one day after the controversial remarks made by the presidents of Harvard, MIT and UPenn.

“What I will say is that is something that we do not stand for. We do not stand for calls for genocide, that is unacceptable, that is vile, we will call that out,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told CNN’s MJ Lee Wednesday, adding that, were administration staff found to have called for genocide, they’d be held to account.

But Jean-Pierre declined to say why university presidents testifying on Capitol Hill were unable to similarly say whether antisemitic or pro-genocide statements run afoul of their respective college codes of conduct.

“I can’t speak for those presidents, I cannot—they have to speak for themselves on this,” she said.

And she wouldn’t say if the university heads should resign following Tuesday’s backlash.

“That is not for us to decide on,” Jean-Pierre said. “Because they each… some of them are private universities, right? They have their own process, we do not get involved in private university’s process and how they run their university.”

Commitment to free speech

At one point during Tuesday’s hearing Stefanik asked Gay if the Ivy League school would punish students or applicants who say, “from the river to the sea” or “intifada.”

Gay explained that type of “hateful, reckless, offensive speech” is “abhorrent” to her.

“Do you believe that type of hateful speech is contrary to Harvard’s code of conduct or is it allowed at Harvard?” Stefanik, who graduated from Harvard, pressed Gay.

“It is at odds with the value of Harvard, but … we embrace a commitment to free expression even of views that are objectionable, offensive, hateful,” Gay said.

David Weild, a former chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market, said there should be no wavering when students feel threatened.

“I can’t believe we are having this conversation in the US Congress,” Weild said in a post on LinkedIn. “I’m a Christian. Shut the hate speech down on all sides. People deserve to feel and be safe.”","['mit', 'leaders', 'presidents', 'despicable', 'university', 'calls', 'penn', 'x', 'president', 'testimony', 'antisemitism', 'harvard', 'students', 'magill', 'genocide']","New York CNN —The presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania faced intense scrutiny on Wednesday from business leaders, donors and politicians following their testimony at a House hearing on antisemitism on campus and calls for genocide in Israel.

414,The minimum wage is increasing in more than 20 states in 2024,"New York CNN —

At the start of the new year, anyone working a minimum wage job will be paid more in 22 states and in at least 40 cities and counties across the country.

The higher hourly rates are due either to scheduled increases or lawmakers having indexed the minimum wage in their jurisdiction to inflation, most typically using the Consumer Price Index as their gauge.

Come January 1, seven states and the District of Columbia will have minimum wages of $15 or more, up from just four states plus DC this year. The newcomers to the category are Maryland, New Jersey and most of New York State (with the exception of New York City, Westchester and Long Island, which already had a $15 minimum in place and where the minimum wage is increasing to $16 in the new year).

The highest state minimum wage in 2024 will be Washington state, at $16.28, up from $15.74 currently. A close second is California, which is raising its minimum to $16 from $15.50 today.

The state with the biggest jump in its minimum wage next year will be Hawaii, which is hiking it by $2.

January 1 isn’t the only day minimum wages will go up. Some states, such as Nevada and Oregon, have increases set for July 1. Florida’s minimum will go up on September 30.

(See the full list of states increasing their minimum wages below.)

Cities, counties and some industries often trump state minimums

States’ minimum wage rates are often eclipsed by those in many of their own cities and counties.

Take the city of Tukwila, Washington, just south of Seattle. Its minimum wage will hit $20.29 in January, up from $18.99 now. At that level it will have the highest standard minimum wage rate in the country among states, counties and cities on January 1, said Jana Bjorklund, senior counsel and director of employment law and compliance at GovDocs, a compliance software provider for large, multi-jurisidiction employers.

Seattle, which will have a rate of $19.97, won’t be far behind.

Next year, at least 40 cities and counties are hiking their minimum wages, according to GovDocs. They include Flagstaff, Arizona (to $17.40); Mountain View, California (to $18.85); Denver, Colorado (to $18.29) and Portland, Maine (to $15).

And in some states, there are big sector-specific wage hikes on tap. In California, for instance, starting in April, fast food workers must be paid at least $20 an hour, and on June 1, healthcare workers will start earning between $18 and $23 an hour depending on their role and the size and type of employer they work for – an hourly rate that will eventually reach $25.

In New York City, app-based restaurant delivery workers (e.g., those working for Uber, Grubhub and DoorDash) now must be paid a minimum hourly rate of $17.96, which is set to increase to $19.96 by 2025.

The push for non-poverty wages

The federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009. And 20 states – including Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Alabama and Mississippi – still adhere to it.

The push to raise it has gone on for years because minimum wage workers stuck at $7.25 have lost substantial buying power.

Had it just been adjusted for inflation since 2009, it would be $10.33 today. But advocates for a higher minimum wage, including Holly Sklar, CEO of Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, would rather see it adjusted for inflation from where it was in 1968. The wage then was $1.60, which in today’s dollars would be $14.39. That $1.60 provided minimum wage workers with their greatest purchasing power, Sklar said. “Every minimum wage increase since 1968 has been too little too late. … Full-time jobs used to keep people out of poverty.”

She points to MIT’s living wage calculator to assess what a single person without kids would have to earn per hour just to cover the cost of basic needs (e.g., food, housing, transportation and medical care).

For example, in Mississippi, where the minimum wage is just $7.25, a person would have to earn $15.30 an hour in Pike County just to pay for basic needs. But among childcare workers, fast food cooks and cashiers in the state, the median wage (meaning half of people in those jobs earn less) ranges between $9.83 and $10.17 an hour, Sklar noted.

Given how little movement there has been at the federal level to raise the country’s minimum wage sufficiently, she expects states and local jurisdictions will continue to do the heavy lifting.

And she believes the economic case for their increases is there for both workers and employers.

For workers, of course, “It eases the burden,” Sklar said. “People replace tires they couldn’t replace or get their kids clothes.”

For businesses, she said, consumer spending goes up because minimum wage workers will spend their additional earnings quickly. And among other things, it will help boost retention of one’s workers because they won’t be as quick to quit for another 25 cents an hour. Less turnover, in turn, can reduce an employer’s hiring and training costs, among other benefits.

“It’s a virtuous cycle,” Sklar said.

415,Here’s why gas could drop below $3,"New York CNN —

The sell-off in the oil market accelerated Wednesday, with US crude prices sinking below $70 a barrel for the first time since July.

The latest wave of selling bodes well for consumers, suggesting gas prices could fall even closer towards $3 a gallon nationally.

Gas prices bottomed out at $3.10 a gallon in late December last year just before Christmas. The national average hasn’t been below $3 since May 2021.

US crude tumbled to as low as $69.11 a barrel on Wednesday, the lowest intraday level since June 29. Oil closed at $69.38 a barrel, down 4.1% on the day. Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 3.8% to $74.25 a barrel.

Analysts said the selloff is being driven by a confluence of factors, including concerns about soft demand in China, record-setting supply from the United States and disappointment over last week’s OPEC+ decision.

“The market has fallen off quite rapidly,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates. “It could really be interpreted as OPEC+ losing its ability to control prices.”

Last week, OPEC+ members agreed to supply cuts but that agreement was met with skepticism because of the voluntary nature of the move.

“The OPEC+ production cuts appear to be more style than substance,” Lipow said.

All of this is welcome news for consumers. Even before Wednesday’s oil sell-off, the national average price for regular gas fell to $3.22 a gallon, according to AAA. That’s a fresh 11-month low and well below the peak in September of $3.88.

Gas prices are likely to decline another 5 to 7 cents a gallon in the next week, according to Lipow. He said while new turmoil in the Middle East or a Venezuelan takeover of Guyana could revive oil prices, there is a growing chance that US gas prices will drop towards $3 a gallon nationally.

Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities, described Wednesday’s sell-off as a “meltdown.” New federal data, revealing a large increase in weekly gasoline inventories, caused concern about weak energy demand, according to Yawger.","['according', 'drop', 'oil', 'gallon', 'heres', 'gas', 'crude', 'selloff', 'barrel', 'lipow', 'opec', 'prices']","The latest wave of selling bodes well for consumers, suggesting gas prices could fall even closer towards $3 a gallon nationally.

416,The Washington Post braces for historic 24-hour strike as journalists protest staff cuts and contract frustrations,"CNN —

Hundreds of staffers at The Washington Post are set to strike for 24 hours on Thursday, protesting recently announced cuts to the newspaper’s workforce and applying pressure on management to reach an agreement on a new union contract.

“Taking this historic action is not a decision we came to lightly,” The Washington Post Guild said in a letter to readers. “We take seriously the impact it will have on the people, issues and communities we cover.”

A protest of such magnitude has not been staged at The Post since the 1970s, according to the union, signaling how frustrated members are with the state of affairs at the Jeff Bezos-owned newspaper.

The union, which represents roughly 1,000 employees at The Post, has been negotiating a new contract with executives for 18 months, but it has yet to arrive at an agreement, much to the dismay of members who have expressed significant frustration with management over the process.

A spokesperson for The Post said in a statement that the newspaper respects the right of its employees to strike.

“We will make sure our readers and customers are as unaffected as possible,” the spokesperson said. “The Post’s goal remains the same as it has from the start of our negotiations: to reach an agreement with the Guild that meets the needs of our employees and the needs of our business.”

The labor dispute comes as The Post struggles financially, with the paper on track to lose approximately $100 million this year. To that end, The Post’s management team has moved to cut costs, announcing in October that it aims to slash its workforce by 10% through voluntary buyouts.

Patty Stonesifer, The Post’s interim chief executive, disclosed to employees when announcing the buyouts that the company had “overshot on expenses” and that management needed to “right size” the business.

Last week, Stonesifer warned employees that if 240 people do not volunteer for the buyout offer, layoffs would ensue. Stonesifer said in a meeting this week that 175 employees had so far taken the buyout offers ahead of next week’s deadline.

Staffers at The Post have balked at the need for cuts, often pointing out that the newspaper is owned by Bezos, one of the richest men in the world. Bezos has stressed that he wants The Post to be financially solvent.

During the 24-hour work stoppage, The Guild has encouraged readers to avoid reading or sharing The Post’s editorial content.

“On Dec. 7, we ask you to respect our walkout by not crossing the picket line: For 24 hours, please do not engage with any Washington Post content,” the Guild said. “That includes our print and online news stories, podcasts, videos, games and recipes.”

Meanwhile, management is working to ensure that The Post continues to deliver news to its readers during the strike. The newspaper will likely rely on its editors, who are not members of the union, to author stories.

The Post is far from the only news institution engaged in a labor dispute with its employees. Unionized staffers at Condé Nast have been protesting layoffs at the publishing company.

417,McDonald’s CEO: Bigger burgers are coming,"New York CNN —

McDonald’s has a burger strategy to spark growth in the next few years. That strategy can be boiled down to one word: More.

“In the US, in a number of markets, around the world, having a larger burger is an opportunity,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told CNN in an interview.

“We’re working on that,” he added. “That is something that you should expect in the future.”

It’s not just more burger in your burger. It’s more everything. The burger chain plans to open thousands more restaurants. It wants to add 100 million members to its loyalty program, which nudges customers into spending more. And it’s investing in more marketing campaigns to get people craving its burgers and fries — and, increasingly, chicken sandwiches, too.

Bigger burgers

McDonald’s has already been working on a plan to improve how its burger tastes. But it’s learned that in addition to softer buns and gooeyer cheese, people also want a more sizable burger.

“We’ve listened to our customers. And we understand their desire for larger, high-quality burgers that fill you up,” said Jo Sempels, who oversees markets where McDonald’s has licensed its brand, during an investor event on Wednesday.

McDonald’s plans to test options in limited markets and, once it finds the best one, roll it out more broadly, Sempels said.

That’s a similar approach to how McDonald’s landed on the McCrispy chicken sandwich, after failing for years to come up with the right recipe and branding. Now, Sempels noted, chicken amounts for $25 billion in annual sales across the system, just like beef.

McDonald’s plan for bigger burgers comes at a time when many customers are looking for ways to spend less — and as a pricey McDonald’s burger has become something of a symbol of inflation.

But the coming burger, though bigger, shouldn’t break the bank. “We think we’re going to be able to deliver a great tasting large burger at a superior value to what [customers] can get anywhere else,” Kempczinski said.

More restaurants

In addition to selling larger burgers, McDonald’s wants to be everywhere.

The burger chain plans to have 50,000 locations globally by 2027, it said in a release Wednesday. As of September 30, there were roughly 41,000 McDonald’s establishments in all.

The increase would be “the fastest period of growth in company history,” McDonald’s said in a statement.

It may seem like the global market is already saturated with fast food restaurants. But McDonald’s doesn’t see it that way: As humanity changes, the company should too — and add more restaurants, so it can maximize sales in all areas.

“With our current size and scale, some in this room might be questioning whether there is truly more space to grow,” said Manu Steijaert, the company’s global chief customer officer, during Wednesday’s event. “I’m here to tell you we see an incredible opportunity to grow the business by building more locations, getting us even closer to our customers.”

And being physically closer to customers really does matter to McDonald’s. People could get to a McDonald’s more quickly, of course. But it also means the McDonald’s can get to them more quickly, too, with shorter wait and delivery times.

The company has been looking at population forecasts in addition to “a hyper local understanding of customer demands,” to help determine how it should grow, Steijaert said.

Adding 9,000 locations in about three years will mark a sea change in the company’s pace of growth. The first McDonald’s opened in 1940. It took until the early 1970s to get to 10,000 locations, Steijaert said. And it only hit the 40,000 milestone in 2021.

Kempczinski spoke about the company’s need to evolve earlier this year.

“Our footprint reflects what the population looks like probably 20 or 30 years ago,” Kempczinski said of the company’s domestic footprint during an analyst call in July. “There’s a number of places around the US where we are significantly underdeveloped relative to where the population exists today. That opens up for us a whole bunch of development opportunities for us to go after,” he said.

Along with geographical changes, the company is also considering how the very idea of what a McDonald’s is should change as well.

Kempczinski added at the time that the company can now “[think] about small format,” because “of the growth that’s happened with the digital and delivery, where you don’t necessarily need the big dining rooms that you needed in our traditional restaurants.”

Over the summer, McDonald’s said it was testing out a new restaurant concept called “CosMc’s,” named after a little-known McDonald’s character.

As McDonald’s scales up, it’s still planning to stick to its regular formats, Kempczinski told CNN on Wednesday.

“The vast majority of what we’re going to build are going to be our traditional restaurants,” he said, which includes a dining room and a drive-thru, as well as spaces for pickup. “There probably will be some restaurants that are drive-thru and delivery only,” he said, “but that’s going to be the minority.”

More loyalty program users

In addition to the new locations, McDonald’s wants to significantly expand its loyalty program, taking it from 150 million to 250 million 90-day active users by 2027.

Loyalty programs let companies learn more about their customers’ preferences and allow them to offer specific deals that may help prevent them from going to competitors.

Getting people to commit to McDonald’s by joining a loyalty program is as important as expanding geographically, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald’s USA, said during Wednesday’s investor event.

“Historically, the number of our locations was our competitive advantage at McDonald’s,” Erlinger said Wednesday. “In the future, data will sit alongside restaurant locations as another significant competitive advantage.” Loyalty members visit restaurants more often and spend more than other customers, he noted.

A big part of the app will be about personalization fueled by artificial intelligence, Kempzcinski told CNN. On Wednesday, the company announced a partnership with Google, focusing on artificial intelligence. AI will be used behind the scenes, according to the company, and also to recommend food to customers based on what they like.

More marketing

“Maximizing our marketing remains a meaningful growth opportunity,” said Jill McDonald, who is in charge of wholly-owned international markets, during Wednesday’s event.

Marketing, she said, is driving higher sales at restaurants open at least 13 months.

One example of McDonald’s marketing success: the Grimace shake.

When McDonald’s introduced the shake, it probably didn’t expect the item to go viral on TikTok quite like it did: with TikTokers showing themselves sipping the dessert drink and then, soon after, writhing in mock pain or playing dead. But the mini horror films inspired people to buy shakes (if only to make more videos).

“One of the things that we’ve been hearing from our fans is a curiosity and an excitement about some of these characters that we’ve had in our history,” Kempzcinski told CNN. “When you do it the right way, it quickly becomes part of culture.”","['coming', 'ceo', 'growth', 'loyalty', 'going', 'restaurants', 'customers', 'locations', 'bigger', 'cnn', 'mcdonalds', 'burger', 'burgers', 'company']","New York CNN —McDonald’s has a burger strategy to spark growth in the next few years.

418,"This US bought a house in France for $20,000 without seeing it","CNN —

Her fascination with France began when she spent a summer in the European country while working as an au pair back back in the 1970s.

From then on, Ellen, originally from the East Coast of the US, made it her mission to travel to France whenever she got the chance to.

She met her now husband Joseph, from the West Coast, in the late 1970s and the couple went on to marry and have three children, continuing to travel to the country as a family once every two years or so.

“It’s funny, Joseph and our daughter would tease me, because anytime we were planning a vacation, I always wanted to come to France,” Ellen admits.

“They liked France too, but they would say, ‘Can we go somewhere else?’ [I would say,] ‘Yes, as long as we stop in Paris first or something like that.’ So, it was a compromise usually.”

‘Half house’

Ellen and her husband Joseph came across a rundown home in the historic village of Lonlay l'Abbaye in Normandy and purchased it unseen. Ellen and Joseph A.

Although Ellen and Joseph, who have chosen not to disclose their surname, had been toying with the prospect of moving to France for years, it wasn’t until they were both approaching retirement age that they began seriously thinking about buying a property there.

Ellen came across a tiny rundown home in the historic village of Lonlay l’Abbaye in Normandy, northern France, while browsing French real estate online, back in 2014.

“The house was affordable,” says Joseph, who previously worked as a business executive. “It was obviously a bit of a ruin. But it was within our budget.

“And that was always foremost in our minds. What can we budget? How much should we plan to spend on improvements, and so on and so forth. So, the budgetary element was pretty important for us.”

They then spent some time checking out the “charming” village on Google Street View, and eventually came across an account of two American soldiers who’d been “helped by the French Resistance in the village during World War II.”

The couple made the decision to purchase the house, which has around 400 square meters of living space, unseen, arranging for an inspector to view it beforehand.

While the property was on the market for around 18,000 euros ($19,400), Ellen and Joseph ended up purchasing it for around 13,000 euros following negotiations with the seller.

“It really wasn’t in move-in condition at all,” says Ellen, explaining that the house would need extensive work to make it liveable again. “The seller kind of agreed with that.”

Once the sale was finalized, they brought in local builders to begin demolition work on the property, overseeing things from their California home.

“They kept us informed. They would send us photographs to show us how the work was progressing,” explains Joseph. “And we would exchange ideas on how the renovation should unfold. So it worked out ok.”

The couple continued to travel to France regularly, flying over in 2015 and 2016 and checking on the progress of the work.

The following year they decided it was finally time to start the process of packing up their lives in the US and moving to France.

The first big step was applying for a long stay visa, which took a few months to finalize, then came what Joseph describes as the “wind down procedure.”

“Prior to your departure, there’s the decision to leave your homeland to go to another country, and all of the implications associated with that decision,” he notes. “All the preparation that has to be done in advance.”

They sold off many of their possessions, keeping only items of sentimental value, and set things in motion so that they could manage their affairs from France.

Big move

They completed extensive renovation work on the home over a period of nearly seven years, replacing the floors and walls, as well as the electrics and plumbing. Ellen and Joseph A.

Ellen and Joseph, who also have a property in New York, decided to rent out their home in California rather than sell it.

They then set about renting an apartment in Paris as their base while work on their Normandy home continued.

“We found that, to be in the parts of Paris that we wanted to live in, it was much less expensive to rent than it would have been to buy,” explains Ellen.

“Plus, the older that you are, the more difficult it is to get a mortgage. We would have had to have sold up and probably bought cash in Paris.”

They arrived in Paris to begin their new lives in April 2017.

Ellen and Joseph quickly set about getting to know their new community, while also traveling back and forth to Lonlay l’Abbaye to check on the renovation work.

“Each year, we budgeted for a different phase of renovation,” says Ellen, before describing how they replaced the floors, walls, electrics, and the plumbing in the home.

“We sought out good building materials and learned about ventilation and humidity issues in old stone houses.”

Ellen goes on to point out that they were able to keep the original staircase inside the house, along with a wooden cabinet that had been in the study.

While they had no choice but to get new windows and doors, they opted to replace them with replicas.

“We like to think that the ghosts of the American GIs who helped to liberate this village would still recognize our house if they walked past it on the street,” she adds.

Their goal was to both transform the tiny house into a liveable second home, and “restore it and leave it in good authentic condition for future generations.”

“We wanted to keep it looking the way it was,” says Ellen. “We didn’t want to make any big changes.”

Renovation project

""We're extremely proud of the builders, who managed to transform this from basically a small country ruin to a very liveable place,"" says Joseph. Ellen and Joseph A.

She points out that any major changes to the outside of our Normandy house had to be approved by the local authorities and the Architectes de Batiments de France, officials concerned with protecting monuments and historic areas, due to the house’s proximity to the village’s 11th century abbey.

But as the work continued to progress, the global pandemic hit, which led to renovations being halted for around two years and they were unable to travel to Normandy to visit.

Thankfully, Ellen and Joseph were able to resume work on the home once restrictions were lifted and had completed the structural work and painting by December 2021. Their new windows were installed a year later.

“We’re extremely proud of the builders, who managed to transform this from basically a small country ruin to a very liveable place,” says Joseph, adding that they’re still working on the furnishing and the “decorative side of” things.

They’d also eventually like to finish off the attic, which is currently used as storage space, and perhaps add a “half bath” up there.

Ellen and Joseph estimate that they spent a total of 65,000 euros (about $70,000) on the building works and labor, and a further 5,000 euros on appliances and furniture.

Now settled in France, they continue to flit back and forth between Paris and Lonlay l’Abbaye, stressing that they wouldn’t have it any other way.

“It’s kind of like a French Brigadoon,” Joseph says of Lonlay l’Abbaye. “There’s a certain magic to the village. The history. The Abbey. And everything is just so close. You’re surrounded by these small hills with trees and grass.

“It’s really a dramatic departure from living in a city like Los Angeles, New York or Paris.”

They’ve formed strong friendships in Lonlay l’Abbaye and travel there by train “every five or six weeks,” staying at their “half house” for a few weeks, before heading back to their rented apartment in Paris.

According to Joseph, the journey between the properties is a little over two and a half hours – their home is a 20-minute taxi ride from Flers station in Normandy.

Both feel that life in France has done wonders for them, explaining that they walk a lot more, and eat much better due to the readily available fresh produce.

“Our daughter thinks that we’ve definitely extended our lifespans by moving here,” says Ellen.

“It just seems like a much healthier lifestyle for us.”

Early on, they decided to “shoulder the responsibility” of learning French to make the transition easier, and stress that this has helped tremendously when it comes to forming bonds.

“Now 90% of all speaking that we do is in French,” says Joseph. “Even though we are far from proficient in French, it’s just something that really, really matters to us. And of course, it makes a difference to other people as well.”

However, the couple admit that they still occasionally find it daunting while attending a dinner with only French speakers who want to discuss philosophy.”

They’ve had to adapt to some of the cultural differences between the French and Americans, and say that some have been easier to get used to than the others.

For instance, Joseph points out that the French are “very, very private” in comparison to Americans, and perhaps less willing to share their lives.

“They don’t invite you to their home right away,” he notes. “They don’t address you in the first person.

“And that’s in contrast to the United States, where people are much more open with each other.”

However, Ellen acknowledges that she’s always been “more comfortable with the French frame of mind” when it comes to relating to people and forming friendships, so this has suited her fine.

“Maybe I’m just a little more introverted,” she notes.

The couple, who chronicled the renovation in an online blog, have found life in France to be more affordable than in the US, noting that their health care costs and property taxes are considerably less now.

In fact, they say the latter is roughly five to six times more on their properties in the States.

“I think that’s one reason why a lot of Americans are thinking of Europe,” says Joseph. “Because of the cost of living, and the property taxes, but also the health care.”

While they both miss living in southern California, neither has any regrets about leaving, admitting that it had become quite draining for them towards the end.

“The traffic. The craziness. And then, to some extent, politically. The divisions in the US were very stressful,” says Ellen.

“It’s not like we were having daily battles with people. But it was hard to watch. It’s still hard to watch the press from overseas and see how divided America is.

“Gee, it doesn’t feel like the America we grew up in anymore.”

They’ve gotten to explore much of France during their time there and have been enjoying learning about the different regions.

“We fully appreciate how much the French enjoy and appreciate the seasons, the moments and the food,” says Ellen. “It’s a different cultural thing, but it’s something you can appreciate.”

They say that they’d advise anyone considering a similar move to research their chosen destination carefully and refrain from trying to “replicate America” wherever they go.

“Leave some of those expectations behind,” says Ellen. “Because you don’t want to just beat your head against a brick wall, and insist on thinking like an American. Saying ‘well, this should be easy, and they should do it this way.’”

They acknowledge that spending so much time in France beforehand made things easier for them, stressing that things may have turned out differently if they had been less familiar with the country.

“We have encountered that with some friends,” says Joseph. “You [can] get some real culture clash.”

Ellen and Joseph currently have no plans to buy a place in Paris and say they’ll continue to move between their apartment in the 7th arrondissement and the countryside, perhaps spending eight months in Paris and four months in Lonlay l’Abbaye in the future.

“It’s kind of an ideal situation where you have a place to get away to. To enjoy everything that Paris has to offer, but then to also get a break from the noise and the business.”

Although they’ve returned to the US to spend time with their family and friends since relocating, they have no intention of returning to the country to live at this point, and can see themselves remaining in France for the rest of their lives.

“There are moments, of course, when we do miss a place, or something from the United States,” says Joseph.

“But this is a way of life. We’re trying to be Americans enjoying France and living here compatibly with the country.

419,"The Garisenda 'leaning tower' in Bologna, Italy, is on 'high alert' for collapse","Editor’s Note: Sign up to CNN Travel’s Unlocking Italy newsletter for insider intel on Italy’s best loved destinations and lesser-known regions to plan your ultimate trip. Plus, we’ll get you in the mood before you go with movie suggestions, reading lists and recipes from Stanley Tucci.

CNN —

It’s the ‘leaning tower’ that has stood tipsily – but steadily – for nearly 1,000 years. But now, the days of the Garisenda tower in Bologna, Italy, could be numbered. Following investigations last month, the city is instigating a civil protection plan for the “sudden and unexpected collapse of the tower,” which has dominated the Bologna skyline since the 12th century.

A protective metal cordon will be erected to “contain debris resulting from a possible collapse, to reduce the vulnerability of surrounding buildings and the exposure to the population, as well as blocking access to the off-limits area,” the city council said in a statement.

The cordon will be fixed into the ground, and will include specially designed rockfall protection nets, also made of metal and also anchored to the ground.

The warning of a possible collapse was issued in a 27-page report, shared with CNN, by the scientific committee which has monitored the site since 2019.

It puts the site on “high alert” and states that experts “believe that safety conditions no longer exist to operate on or around the tower, except within the framework of a civil protection plan.”

Monitoring of the site over the past month has revealed an “unexpected and accelerated trend” of “crushing” compression to the base of the tower, with gradual disintegration of the stone used to clad the base and cracks expanding in the brick above, it says.

Consolidation works which were already underway have been halted and an exclusion zone is to be built “in the fastest time possible.”

However, the tower isn’t on the verge of immediate collapse, a spokesperson told CNN.

“We’re acting as if it’s the worst case scenario but that’s not to say it’ll happen,” he said, adding that the precautions are currently on “yellow” alert rather than red, where collapse is imminent.

“We’re acting as if it’s about to collapse, but nobody knows when that could be – it could be three months, 10 years, or 20 years.

“If there was an imminent risk of collapse we’d evacuate everyone,” he said, adding that the monitoring equipment delivers readings every 15 minutes, meaning that they should get warning of a collapse, and can evacuate the surrounding area.

One of Bologna’s famous “twin towers” which dominate the city center, the 48-meter (158 feet) Garisenda was built in the 12th century when Bologna was a mini Manhattan, with dozens of towers reaching towards the sky, each built by local families trying to construct theirs higher than the last. Today, few remain. Of those that do, many have had their tops lopped off and been converted into regular houses.

The Garisenda leans at an angle of four degrees – only a little more upright than the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s five degrees. It was already leaning by the early 14th century when Dante wrote “Inferno,” in which he described the dizzy rush of looking up at the Garisenda’s leaning side. Shortened in later years, it sits in the city center beside the Asinelli – a tower twice the height, which tourists could climb until last month.

Bologna’s mayor, Matteo Lepore, ordered the area around the towers to be blocked off in October, although the move to isolate them was for research reasons, rather than safety ones. Acoustic sensors were placed around the Garisenda to monitor cracking and creaking noises, while a pendulum was installed in both towers to track movement and see if regular “oscillation” was going above a certain threshold.

That research has now found not only increased compression in the base of the tower, but that the lean of the tower has started to shift 90 degrees, from an easterly or southeasterly direction to southwards.

The conditions have been steadily declining since July, said a spokesperson for the city council.

Gradual disintegration of the rock attached to the base, as well as vertical cracks in the bricks that make up the tower, have been noted since 2020 but have now worsened.

The report, which was published on November 15, confirms that the tower has been in an “inescapably critical condition for some time,” and suggests that previous interventions, including a “hoop” of steel rods and cables around the base in 2020, have aggravated the situation.

“The overall situation has unfortunately worsened considerably, with worrying implications for the overall stability of the tower,” reads the report.

“The unexpected and accelerated trend leads the committee to immediately suspend all activities currently underway (especially consolidation) and to put the site on high alert. [The committee believes] that safety conditions no longer exist to operate on or around the tower, except within the framework of a civil protection plan.”

Extreme weather events, including high temperatures this summer and flooding earlier this year, also appear to have played a part, according to the council spokesperson.

Red alert

The cordon will be finished by February. Comune di Bologna

Materials for the protective cordon will be delivered to a site near the tower within the next couple of weeks, with the works due to be completed by February, according to the council.

But anyone who was hoping that the cordon would fit in with the medieval buildings around it will be disappointed by the renderings, which show bright red barriers around the Garisenda. However, it is hopefully only temporary – the report stipulates that any anti-collapse measures must be reversible.

The council spokesperson said that once the cordon has been installed, new research will be undertaken in two phases: first to find a solution to stabilize the tower, and then to resolve the underlying problem.

He said that the first phase might mean creating a metal “cage” for the structure. The second phase is causing more debate.

“Some say let’s dismantle it, redo the base and rebuild it. Others say let’s trim it [the tower itself] as was done in the medieval period. These are all hypotheses that we’re studying – the tower is nearly 1,000 years old and there’s no rulebook,” he said.

The works won’t come cheap – the cordon alone will cost 4.4 million euros (about $4.8 million), and any stabilizing work will cost “millions and millions,” said the spokesperson. The council has set up an online fundraiser with an aim of raising 3 million euros. It has already raised 800,000 euros in a week.

“The twin towers are one of the symbols of the city, along with the [UNESCO-protected] porticoes,” said the spokesperson.

“This isn’t just about saving a heritage site; it also has a very strong symbolic value.”","['leaning', 'protection', 'city', 'collapse', 'garisenda', 'high', 'spokesperson', 'italy', 'alert', 'cordon', 'towers', 'bologna', 'tower', 'base', 'site']","CNN —It’s the ‘leaning tower’ that has stood tipsily – but steadily – for nearly 1,000 years.

420,Harvey Lewis set a backyard ultramarathon record by running 450 miles for four and a half days – while barely sleeping,"CNN —

There came a moment, somewhere on a roadside in rural Tennessee, when Harvey Lewis felt like he could keep running forever.

At this point, he had already been on the move, practically non-stop, for about four days, looping around the same roads, trails, and tracks amongst an ever-shrinking group of runners.

He was battling through feverish sleep deprivation on leaden, depleted legs, and on the front of his sweat-stained vest he wore the splattered evidence of an earlier nosebleed.

But looks can be deceiving, and deep in the corner of his stubborn mind, Lewis knew that he held the golden ticket to winning this backyard ultramarathon race: ensure that every other competitor quits before you.

As the race wore on, he began to feel unstoppable.

“It was like a frequency I found with my rhythm and my pace,” says Lewis, “where I could just maintain that for an incredible amount of time.

“There was some sort of place where my brain took over … and the body finally surrendered to my mind.”

This was at Big’s Backyard Ultra in October, the world championships of backyard ultrarunning.

The discipline of ultrarunning is broadly defined as any distance beyond the 26.2 miles of a marathon, but a backyard ultra has no predetermined length. Runners complete a 4.167-mile loop on the hour, every hour until only one person is left standing. The other competitors are deemed not to have finished, either by dropping out or failing to complete a loop within the cut-off time.

Lewis, a high school teacher and seasoned distance runner from Cincinnati, entered uncharted territory as far as backyard ultras are concerned, completing a scarcely believable 108 loops – the equivalent of 450 miles – over four and a half days at Big’s.

His gargantuan feat of endurance and resilience eventually came to an end when his final competitor, Ihor Verys, failed to complete his 108th loop, becoming what’s known in backyard ultrarunning as “the assist.”

Several weeks later, Lewis is still trying to get his head around his world record – six laps, or 25 miles, more than Australian Phil Gore’s managed at a backyard ultra earlier this year.

“I managed to pull off stretching it to four and a half days,” Lewis tells CNN Sport. “That’s really kind of riveting to me. It sparks my imagination.”

In total, Lewis covered the equivalent of the entire length of Florida, or about the distance from his hometown Cincinnati to Atlanta, stopping only for a few minutes between each loop.

He was midway through his final loop when it suddenly dawned on him that Verys had finally succumbed to the race’s gauntlet of pain, handing Lewis the victory as long as he could haul himself to the cut-off one last time.

“Finishing the final person, you’re on cloud nine,” the 47-year-old Lewis says. “It’s like one of the biggest highs of my life. I couldn’t describe it, especially when it’s such a rigorous, challenging goal.”

There are hundreds of backyard ultras staged around the world each year, but Big’s is the discipline’s original and most famous event.

The concept was devised by Gary Cantrell, the gatekeeper of some of the world’s most punishing foot races, including the fabled Barkley Marathons. Better known as Lazarus Lake, or simply “Laz” to those in the ultrarunning community, Cantrell first staged Big’s around his farm in Bell Buckle in 2011.

The race consists of two different loops: one on trails during the day and another on roads during the night. The start and end of each loop is marked by an overhead structure which reads “there is no finish,” the first three words written by hand and pinned to the banner in crude fashion.

It is there that runners must congregate at the top of the hour, every hour in order to stay in the race.

“It’s a tribute to a human’s ability to just continually push that boundary of what’s possible further and further out,” Cantrell says in a video promoting the event.

Lewis, now a two-time winner and three-time assist, is a dedicated disciple of Big’s. He credits success in this year’s race to a combination of careful preparation, his previous experience on the course and at many other ultramarathons, and sheer force of will in the closing stages.

“I always believed that I was going to still be the final person, and I never lost the vision of that,” says Lewis.

His training for this year’s race was at times peculiar, especially when it came to managing sleep deprivation. During his lunchtime breaks at school, Lewis would roll out a yoga mat in a storage closet and try to fall asleep for three to five minutes as quickly as possible, simulating the short breaks he would get between loops at Big’s.

Other times, he says that he would run to the park and lie down on the grass for several minutes.

Come the race itself, Lewis’ sleep strategy hardly went to plan. Unable to quiet his mind the night before, he only slept for three hours and then didn’t sleep at all for the first three days of the race. After that, he was able to switch off for one or two minutes between loops.

Thankfully, he wasn’t derailed by the same “incredibly intense hallucinations” that plagued him during a backyard ultra in Australia earlier in the year.

“I actually saw these grass people and the trees came alive,” Lewis recalls. “I would fall asleep for just a second, my sense of sound was super accented. It was like that show ‘Stranger Things.’”

His strategy if he gets similar hallucinations in another race? “I feel like I would be able to, like, just run through that,” Lewis adds. “It would maybe make it very interesting.”

That’s not to say that his sanity remained entirely intact at Big’s: on the fourth day, he started to talk gibberish to the other competitors.

“I was semi-conscious, semi-dreaming, and I would just start to say random things,” says Lewis. “I had to censor myself and not just say whatever I was thinking in my dreamlike running state.”

He estimates that he consumed more than 40,000 calories during the race, all of which was plant-based – something Lewis says helped to settle his stomach when eating on the move.

His race diet was varied and plentiful: avocado and hummus wraps, lentil soup, peanut noodles, vegan mac and cheese, vegan yoghurt, cupcakes, and different fruits – blueberries, mangoes, watermelon – were all on the menu.

He also never drank water on the course, instead opting for fluids with calories like coconut water, Coke, or electrolyte drinks.

“I was always grazing on foods,” says Lewis, “enjoying my appetite and enjoying the smorgasbord.”

An upset stomach is one of myriad challenges a runner might face at Big’s. Another is the risk of a fall – particularly on the roots, rocks, and foliage found on the day-time loop around Cantrell’s farm – while rattlesnakes and copperheads can also make for alarming bystanders on the trails.

Lewis fell just once, evidenced by the reddish marks that appeared on the side of his head towards the end of the race. “I’m pretty good at falling,” he explains. “I’ve fallen a lot in my lifetime.”

How a runner responds to adversity can be crucial at determining how long they survive at Big’s. Lewis figures that the effort required in the race is about 70% mental and 30% physical, and he has developed unique ways of hardening his mind during backyard ultras.

“I have spirit animals that I like to embody in the race,” says Lewis. “With Big’s, I was saying that my spirit animal was the honey badger. The honey badger can be knocked down, beaten, bitten, cut – everything happening to it and the honey badger just keeps on going.”

The honey badger analogy can also be extended to Lewis’ ultrarunning career as a whole, his progress in the sport gutsy and gradual. He says that he achieved the qualification time for the Boston Marathon after 17 years of trying and won an ultramarathon 13 years after competing in his first.

He describes himself as a “chubby” kid growing up – quite the contrast to the man who these days runs to and from work, adding extra distance as he builds up to a race.

“It was an ultra to get to where I am today,” says Lewis.

He was running Big’s to raise money for the Brighton Center, an organization in Northern Kentucky which helps individuals and families to achieve financial stability and independence, and also wants to inspire people to invest more in their personal health – even if that means getting outdoors for 20 or 30 minutes each day.

And in terms of his personal goals, Lewis has started to reflect on what it might be possible to achieve in the backyard ultra format.

“If the opportunity comes again: how will I be able to go through that fifth night?” he muses. “How will I come out on that sixth day, and then will we get back to another night?”

Four and a half days and 450 miles might just be the start for Harvey Lewis. This is, after all, a race with no finish line.","['record', 'lewis', 'days', 'ultramarathon', 'sleep', 'minutes', 'loop', 'set', 'harvey', 'backyard', 'sleeping', 'running', 'ultrarunning', 'race', 'half', 'miles', 'ultra', 'bigs']","“There was some sort of place where my brain took over … and the body finally surrendered to my mind.”This was at Big’s Backyard Ultra in October, the world championships of backyard ultrarunning.

421,"UK government signs Hillsborough Charter, acknowledges ‘multiple injustices’ suffered by soccer stadium disaster victims","CNN —

The UK government has signed the Hillsborough Charter, acknowledging “multiple injustices” and vowing that no families will suffer the same fates as the relatives of the victims from the infamous soccer ground tragedy.

Ninety-seven Liverpool supporters died as a result of the April 1989 disaster at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, England.

“The Charter, which the Government has signed, seeks to ensure that the lessons of the Hillsborough disaster and its aftermath are learned, to prevent those who are affected by public tragedy in the future from having the same experience,” UK Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said in a statement on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons: “The Hillsborough families have suffered multiple injustices and, more than 34 years later, there can never be too many apologies for what they have been through.

“And I want to repeat that apology today, and thank the Hillsborough families for their tenacity, patience and courage.”

The government was responding to a 2017 report, published by former Liverpool Bishop James Jones, which consulted the families on lessons from the stadium disaster and made 25 recommendations which could help shape the response to future disasters.

Among those recommendations was a call for the creation of a special charter that would see public bodies act transparently and in the public interest.

The government’s charter also promises to implement a “duty of candour” for policing in England and Wales, which aims to promote a culture of honesty and transparency during investigations and inquiries.

In January, England and Wales police chiefs apologized for having “profoundly failed” those bereaved by the stadium disaster and promised “widespread” policing reforms.

On top of the 97 people killed as a result of the disaster, another 162 were hospitalized with injuries. According to the BBC, it was the worst sports disaster in British history.","['disaster', 'signs', 'signed', 'multiple', 'victims', 'suffered', 'wales', 'charter', 'families', 'stadium', 'uk', 'hillsborough', 'result', 'soccer', 'public', 'injustices']","CNN —The UK government has signed the Hillsborough Charter, acknowledging “multiple injustices” and vowing that no families will suffer the same fates as the relatives of the victims from the infamous soccer ground tragedy.

422,"The Hughes brothers had a historic night on the ice, playing in the same game for the first time as New Jersey Devils win","CNN —

The Hughes family had quite a night on the ice as brothers Jack and Luke faced off against sibling Quinn as the New Jersey Devils defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6-5 at Rogers Arena on Tuesday.

It was the first time that the trio had all played in the same NHL game, and only the ninth time in NHL history that three brothers had taken to the ice at the same time.

According to the NHL, it was the second time an American family had three brothers play in the same game, and the first since 1990 when Neal and Aaron Broten of the Minnesota North Stars played against their brother Paul and the New York Rangers.

The trio, whose parents were in attendance at Rogers Arena, were able to take a historic photo together at center ice before the game.

“Getting a picture in warm-ups was really good,” said the 20-year-old Luke. “Haven’t really let it sink in yet. Just seeing [Quinn] off ice. I hadn’t seen him for a couple of months.”

The 24-year-old Quinn had two assists for the Canucks, giving him 36 points for the season, the most in the league for a defenseman. Luke and the 22-year-old Jack both scored for the Devils. Jack also picked up two assists.

“Of course you dream you’re going to play with your brothers in the NHL one day,” Jack told the NHL website before the game. “You’re in the basement, hanging out, playing, but you never really think it’s going to become a reality. For it to happen, it’s definitely pretty wild. It’s three kids in one game.

If much of the focus was on the Hughes siblings, Jesper Bratt’s contribution proved key with goals from the Swedish winger bookending the scoring, with a late one-timer off a rebound with 34 seconds left sealing the victory for New Jersey.

The Devils raced into a 5-2 lead through the first two periods but the Canucks came back into the game in the third as goals by Brock Boeser, Sam Lafferty and Nils Hoglander tied things up before Bratt’s last-minute winner.

“Pretty good in the first two [periods] and then pretty ugly in the third,” said Jack, summing up his team’s performance after the game. “But we found a way to win so that’s all that matters.”

“It’s tough now,” Quinn said when asked if he could appreciate playing against his brothers. “I’m sure they’re appreciating it more than I am right now, but it’s very cool. Looking back the next couple of days or months, it’d be a cool one.”

The Hughes brothers are no strangers to making history. Quinn was drafted seventh overall in 2018, Jack went first overall in 2019 and Luke came off the board at fourth overall in 2021, meaning that each brother was selected inside the top seven in an unprecedented feat.

Jack entered Tuesday’s game leading the league in points per game with 1.76, while Quinn came in at fourth overall in league scoring, per the Devils.

“They’ve put their name on notice throughout the League,” said Devils winger Tyler Toffoli ahead of Tuesday’s game. “The three of them are all extremely good players.

With Quinn and Jack being completely established and superstars already and Luke not far behind them.”

Though this was the first time that all three siblings had taken part in the same game, it was the seventh time that Quinn and Jack had faced off. Jack has frequently gotten the better of the matchup, with the Devils having a 6-1-0 record in these clashes.","['hughes', 'luke', 'night', 'nhl', 'quinn', 'overall', 'jersey', 'game', 'ice', 'jack', 'devils', 'league', 'win', 'brothers', 'historic', 'playing']","CNN —The Hughes family had quite a night on the ice as brothers Jack and Luke faced off against sibling Quinn as the New Jersey Devils defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6-5 at Rogers Arena on Tuesday.

423,Copa América 2024: CONMEBOL announces 14 host cities as tournament returns to the US,"CNN —

CONMEBOL, South America’s soccer federation, has announced the 14 cities that will host matches at the 2024 Copa América as the tournament returns to the United States for the first time since 2016.

The 14 cities are Las Vegas (NV), Arlington (TX), Charlotte (NC), Orlando (FL), Miami Gardens (FL), Santa Clara (CA), Atlanta (GA), East Rutherford (NJ), Houston (TX), Austin (TX), Inglewood (CA), Glendale (AZ), Kansas City (KS) and Kansas City (MO).

The tournament opener will be played at Atlanta United’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium, with the final taking place at Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium.

It will be only the second time, after the special centenary Copa América in 2016, that the tournament has been hosted outside of South America.

Ecuador was originally designated as the tournament host but pulled out in November 2022 due to economic and security concerns, as well as a lack of viable stadiums.

That reportedly left just the US and Peru as the two nations willing to host the 2024 edition, with CONMEBOL and CONCACAF – the federation for North America, Central America and the Caribbean – jointly choosing the US in January of this year.

Though the US unquestionably has better stadium infrastructure than any South American nation, the decision to once again host the tournament stateside led to some criticism in Latin America.

“South America is having a hard time organizing its historic national team tournament,” Ezequiel Fernández Moores wrote in Argentine outlet La Nación in February.

CONMEBOL has encountered obstacles in hosting the last three editions of the Copa América held in South America. In 2015, the host nation was changed from Brazil to Chile due to the former already hosting the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.

Colombia was set to co-host the 2020 edition with Argentina, before it was postponed by a year due to the Covid pandemic. Protests across the country the following year led to Colombia withdrawing as co-host, with Argentina following suit soon after as the country grappled with high Covid cases.

The tournament was eventually moved to Brazil and played behind closed doors.

Now, for the third edition in a row, the host nation has been changed after the US took over organizing duties from Ecuador.

However, Fernández Moores questioned why the same scrutiny, particularly around safety, isn’t applied to the United States.

“It doesn’t matter that games can be played in California, the State that has just suffered four mass shootings in just 10 days in January,” Fernández Moores wrote.

“For the third year in a row, the United States suffered more than six hundred mass shootings in 2022. In the first three weeks of 2023, there have already been 39 shootings.

“It is unthinkable that CONMEBOL for its 2024 Copa América or FIFA for its 2026 World Cup would demand that the United States review its festival of naturalized violence, which kills in shopping malls, schools or on any street.”

But hosting the 2024 Copa América is undoubtedly a huge boost for the USA as the country gears up to jointly host the 2026 World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico.

In a country where soccer is still sometimes played in the shadows of the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL, a successful tournament for the US Men’s National Team could play a huge role in boosting national interest ahead of 2026.

The 2016 edition was an overwhelming success, too, registering a record average attendance of 46,000 and becoming the most lucrative Copa América to date, according to La Nación.

Coupled with Lionel Messi’s arrival at Inter Miami, which has garnered worldwide attention and caused spikes in ticket sales and attendances, the 2024 Copa América could prove to be a perfect warm-up of sorts for both organizers and fans alike.

Messi’s matches for Inter Miami have drawn star-studded crowds, while tickets – for both home and away games – are in huge demand, although the club has received criticism for hiking season ticket prices for next year and pricing out fans who had been loyal to the team prior to Messi’s arrival.

It’s unclear whether Messi’s stateside adventure will boost soccer’s popularity in the US long-term, but perhaps few people will care as long as there is plenty of money to be made while he’s still in Miami.

But the Argentine’s arrival hasn’t just boosted the coffers. His utterly dominant performances on the pitch – which have at times looked laughably easy – led Inter Miami to its first title in the club’s five-year history by helping the team win the Leagues Cup just months after joining.

Such has been his influence in 2023 after guiding Argentina to World Cup glory at the end of 2022, Messi was named TIME’s Athlete of the Year on Tuesday.

“At 36, two decades into his unparalleled career, Messi provided a singular stimulus to soccer in America. Attendance, ticket prices, merchandise sales, and viewership soared. His games took on the feel of a religious revival,” Sean Gregory wrote in TIME.

“With the US hosting three major international tournaments in the next three years (Copa América in 2024, the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025, and the grandest of them all, the World Cup, in 2026), it’s sure to attract even more fans. But Messi is an accelerant.

“With the most revered and influential athlete on the planet playing in Miami for at least the next two years, still performing at the top of his game – he won another Ballon d’Or as the world’s player of the year, his eighth, in late October – the US is now a soccer nation. A fútbol nation.”","['host', 'cities', '14', 'copa', 'tournament', 'america', 'nation', 'américa', 'world', 'announces', '2024', 'cup', 'returns', 'conmebol', 'miami']","CNN —CONMEBOL, South America’s soccer federation, has announced the 14 cities that will host matches at the 2024 Copa América as the tournament returns to the United States for the first time since 2016.

424,Aaron Rodgers criticizes ‘character assassination’ of Jets teammate Zach Wilson,"CNN —

New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has criticized what he calls the “character assassination” of his teammate, Zach Wilson, in the media following reports that the former No. 2 overall pick was reluctant to retake the starting position after being benched earlier in the season.

According to the report from The Athletic, citing multiple team sources, the Jets want Wilson to return as the team’s starting quarterback for their Week 14 game against the Houston Texans after experimenting with Tim Boyle and Trevor Siemian in the position, but the third-year signal-caller was hesitant to do so “due to perceived injury risk.”

Rodgers, who suffered a torn Achilles just four snaps into his stint in New Jersey, said that he believed the report was “chickensh*t at its core,” adding that he “loves” Wilson.

“First of all, you can go down a whole rabbit hole with actual sources, made up sources, why is someone willing to be a source?” Rodgers said during his weekly appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” on Tuesday. “What are they gaining out of that?

“On and on and on, but when you use sources and, whether intentional or unintentional, try to assassinate someone’s character like that report does for Zach, I have a real hard time with that.”

The 40-year-old continued: “How can you read it any other way? You’re basically saying this kid is quitting on the team and doesn’t want to play and is giving the middle finger to the organization.

“I don’t want to speak for him. He’s going to get a chance this week to speak and I’m going to let him speak. … (But) he’s gone through a lot of sh*t in the last three years and he’s got every right to be frustrated and disappointed about it.”

CNN has reached out to Wilson to offer him the right of reply to the report. Wilson has not publicly responded to The Athletic’s reporting and is scheduled to speak to the media on Thursday.

Earlier this week, Jets head coach Robert Saleh was non-committal when asked about who would start at quarterback for his team’s Week 14 game against the Houston Texans on Sunday, though he denied reports that Wilson is reluctant to retake the starting position.

“Let’s be clear, if [Wilson] was reluctant to play, he wouldn’t be here,” said Saleh on Monday. “I actually coincidentally just got done speaking with him. He came in about a half hour ago and we had a really good conversation.

“The young man wants the ball. He wants to start. He believes he’s the best quarterback in the room and the best quarterback for this team and the guy who gives us the best chance to win,” added Saleh.

“We’re in a society now where kids miss bowl games because they’re worried about their draft status, right?” said Saleh. “So empathetically, if that discussion had been had somewhere, and again it wasn’t with me, but if that conversation was had and it somehow leaked out to the media, I don’t think that’s indicative of his mindset. The kid wants to play.”

The Athletic story quoted anonymous sources talking about Wilson’s reluctance to return as the Jets’ starter.

Four-time NFL MVP Rodgers expressed his displeasure of the culture of anonymous leaks from within the Jets organization.

“We need to get to the bottom of whatever this is coming from and put a stop to it, privately, because there’s no place in a winning culture where – and this isn’t the only time; there’s been a bunch of other leaks.”

Rodgers added: “Some conversations are only meant for certain people and shouldn’t leave the building.

“There’s a trust that goes along with being in the locker room, where you say something to your homie and that sh*t doesn’t go anywhere. Or you say something in the team meeting room [and it] doesn’t go anywhere. There’s been too many instances this season where stuff is happening. It’s not OK, and we need to weed it out in whatever way necessary.”

425,"Rembrandt painting once valued at $15,000 sells for almost $14 million at Sotheby’s auction","Editor’s Note: This article was updated with the final sale price and other details following the auction’s conclusion.

London CNN —

A painting valued at $15,000 just two years ago fetched almost £11 million ($13.8 million) at a Sotheby’s auction on Wednesday after being identified as the work of the Dutch master Rembrandt.

“Adoration of the Kings” had been virtually unseen since the 1950s, when it first came to light. It was acquired by collector J.C.H. Heldring in Amsterdam in 1955. His widow sold it to a German family in 1985, where it remained until it was sold by Christie’s in Amsterdam two years ago.

At the time of that sale, Christie’s attributed the biblical scene to the “Circle of Rembrandt,” suggesting it had been carried out by a student or an artist close to the famous painter, and estimated its value at between €10,000 and €15,000 (then around $10,600 to $15,900).

Extensive tests revealed changes that Rembrandt had made to the painting. Sotheby's

The monochromatic painting, which measures 9.6 x 7.3 inches, was purchased by an anonymous buyer for €860,000 (then around $910,000) at the Christie’s sale — more than 50 times the painting’s estimated value at the time. It was later identified as “a work of great significance” by the Dutch painter, according to a Sotheby’s press release published prior to Wednesday’s sale.

After the anonymous buyer consigned it to Sotheby’s, the auction house embarked on an 18-month research project to arrive at the painting’s true attribution and value.

The examination, which involved X-rays and infrared imaging, as well as intensive discussions with leading Rembrandt scholars, led Sotheby’s to conclude the painting is “an autograph work by Rembrandt.” Prior to the sale, the auction house gave the work an estimated value of £10 million to £15 million ($12.6 million to $18.8 million).

The auction house believes it was painted early in Rembrandt’s career, around 1628, when he would have been aged 21 or 22 and living in the Dutch city of Leiden.

A rare find

The vast majority of Rembrandt’s works hang in museums around the world, and almost all of those that have come to auction over the past three decades “have been portraits or studies of single character heads,” according to the Sotheby’s release.

As such, “Adoration of the Kings,” which depicts the encounter between the Three Wise Men and the baby Jesus, represented a “fantastic opportunity” in the art world, George Gordon, co-chairman of Old Master Paintings Worldwide at Sotheby’s, told CNN prior to the sale.

In a phone call with CNN, he said: “I would say that it’s particularly significant because it adds to our understanding of Rembrandt at this crucial date in his development and career, when he was clearly very ambitious and developing very quickly as an artist.”

The earliest reference to the painting appears to be from the 1714 inventory of a collector in Amsterdam, Constantijn Ranst. It was then offered for sale in 1814 and again in 1822, after which it disappeared from view until the mid-20th century.

It was included in museum exhibitions and referenced as a Rembrandt work by leading Rembrandt scholars in the 1950s, but in 1960 German art historian Kurt Bauch, who only knew the painting from a black and white photograph, described it as a product of the Rembrandt School and omitted it from from the catalogue raisonné he was compiling. Thereafter, the painting was “entirely overlooked and completely ignored in the Rembrandt literature,” according to Sothebys.

Gordon told CNN that those bidding at the Christie’s auction in 2021 “must have thought it was much better than the description and that it might well be a Rembrandt.”

Sotheby’s close examination revealed a number of changes and revisions that Rembrandt made, including to the baby Jesus’ halo and the Virgin Mary’s headdress, according to the auction house.

“Very few narrative paintings by Rembrandt remain in private hands, making this an opportunity for a private collector or an institution that is as rare as it is exciting,” Gordon had said in the news release.

“This sophisticated painting is in equal measure a product of Rembrandt’s brush and his intellect. All the hallmarks of his style in the late 1620s are evident both in the visible painted surface and in the underlying layers revealed by science, showing multiple changes in the course of its creation, and casting fresh light on how he thought,” he added.","['14', 'valued', 'paintings', 'sothebys', 'million', 'auction', 'rembrandt', '15000', 'cnn', 'christies', 'painting', 'work', 'sale', 'sells']","London CNN —A painting valued at $15,000 just two years ago fetched almost £11 million ($13.8 million) at a Sotheby’s auction on Wednesday after being identified as the work of the Dutch master Rembrandt.

427,Florence Nightingale: ‘Final’ photos of nursing pioneer up for auction,"London CNN —

Photos thought to be among the last taken of Florence Nightingale are among a number of items related to the famed English nurse going up for auction in London.

The small, sepia images were taken by Eliza Francis “Fanny” Pettit, who was Nightingale’s companion late in her life, and show the nurse sitting in an armchair, according to auction house Roseberys.

A photo from the sale shows Nightingale sitting in an armchair. from Roseberys London

They measure just 5.9 x 5.9 centimeters (2.3 x 2.3 inches) and were taken around 1910. Nightingale died on August 13 of that year, at age 90.

“The family history behind these photographs leads us to believe that they may be the final images taken of Nightingale,” Jack Wallis, a works of art specialist at Roseberys, told CNN.

“We can be certain that they were taken in 1910, and as such almost certainly in the final weeks or months of Nightingale’s life,” he said. The photos were exclusively exhibited at the Florence Nightingale Museum in London, confirming their authenticity, Wallis added.

“What makes them so special is their personal, candid nature - they are informal shots captured for posterity by a close friend to remember a much-loved principal,” he said.

Born in 1820, Nightingale was an English nurse who became the first woman to receive the Order of Merit, for her efforts treating wounded soldiers during the 1853-1856 Crimean War. She became famous as the “Lady with the Lamp” because of her reputation for making rounds at night to check on the patients.

Nightingale went on to play a key role in formalizing education for nurses, setting up the Nightingale School of Nursing at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London in 1860.

International Nurses Day is celebrated every year on May 12, Nightingale’s birthday, in her honor.

Other items in Thursday’s sale include a travel teapot and silver-plated tea caddy, given to Pettit by Nightingale, as well as a letter written by housekeeper Elizabeth Bosanquet detailing the last hours of Nightingale’s life.

In the letter, Bosanquet invited Pettit to visit “to look on Miss Nightingale’s peaceful face.”

“She passed away quietly at 2pm yesterday resting on her pillows just as she had been placed the night before,” it reads, according to Roseberys.

“It was very peaceful and merciful and one is so thankful she slept away with no suffering,” Bosanquet wrote. “We shall all be the better for her wonderful influence.”

Wallis said that “it is very rare for a collection of this nature to come to market, particularly in relation to an icon of British history such as Florence Nightingale.”

“The collection really paints a picture of Nightingale’s character and the last days of her life,” he said.

It is expected to fetch £15,000-25,000 ($19,000-31,000) at auction.","['pioneer', 'florence', 'taken', 'london', 'life', 'auction', 'nurse', 'nursing', 'photos', 'nightingales', 'final', 'pettit', 'bosanquet', 'nightingale']","London CNN —Photos thought to be among the last taken of Florence Nightingale are among a number of items related to the famed English nurse going up for auction in London.

428,Opinion: US must send tougher message to Iran’s proxies in the Middle East,"Editor’s note: Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist.

CNN —

US military forces once again confronted aggressive, potentially deadly moves by Iran-allied militias in the Middle East over the weekend. It’s further evidence that American efforts to deter these militias’ dangerous, persistent belligerence are simply not working. The message to Iran is not getting through.

Frida Ghitis CNN

On Sunday, explosions rocked the Red Sea¸ the narrow but pivotal body of water that connects Europe to the Middle East and Asia. Yemen’s Houthi militias, closely allied with Iran, were firing missiles at commercial vessels and possibly at US naval ships, so the United States fired back, shooting down drones, repeating a now familiar but increasingly perilous cycle that threatens to escalate with potentially ominous consequences.

The USS Carney responded amid a series of four attacks by the Houthis, according to US Central Command. Most of the militia’s targets were civilian cargo ships, but, worryingly, at least one armed drone was “headed toward Carney although its specific target is not clear,” the US statement said.

The continuing attacks by militias allied with Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, targeting US forces across the Middle East along with civilian vessels, are posing an untenable dilemma for the Biden administration.

The White House wisely wants to prevent the war between Israel and Hamas — like the Houthis a member of Iran’s “axis of resistance” — from expanding into a regional conflict. But Iran’s proxies are relentlessly taunting the Americans. Iran’s partners have launched at least 76 separate attacks against US forces in Syria and Iraq since mid-October, a defense official told CNN. They attack American targets almost daily.

The Biden administration is trying to modulate its response, hitting back hard enough to deter Iran with multiple strikes against a variety of targets — killing Iran-backed militia members in Iraq this weekend, striking IRGC weapons depots in Syria, warning Hezbollah in Lebanon to think twice before jumping in — but not so hard that it falls into the trap of getting involved in another war, which neither President Joe Biden nor any responsible person in America wants.

Iran knows that.

Some Republicans are critical of the Biden administration for not doing more to prevent the attacks by the Houthis and other Iran proxies. Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, a Democrat, recently urged a more aggressive approach as well.

As Israel and Hamas battle each other, Iran is showcasing its defiance, trying to flex its muscle, highlighting its geographic reach across several Mideast countries, perhaps seeking to intimidate other regional rivals, along with Israel and even the United States. By keeping its own uniformed fighters largely out of the fray, Tehran has plausible deniability about its involvement in the attacks.

Few are fooled. Central Command’s statement on Sunday declared that the US believes the Houthi attacks “are fully enabled by Iran.”

For the Houthis, these violent expressions of solidarity with Hamas constitute an opportunity to burnish their standing among the Arab and Muslim publics, who are siding strongly with the Palestinians.

Whatever the motivation, the continuing attacks, and the escalating threats to civil navigation cannot be allowed to stand.

One of the most urgent items on the agenda is stabilizing conditions on the Red Sea. Look at a map. The Red Sea is the channel that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the rest of the Middle East and Asia. Any commerce between China, India or other Asian countries with Europe or the US East Coast has to pass through the Suez Canal that links the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The Houthis pose a grave threat to international commerce and the global economy, not to mention regional stability.

The US and NATO should assertively defend freedom of navigation. The Houthis, an Iran-armed organization, needs to be confronted before a disaster at sea sends shockwaves of disruption across the global economy.

In the first place, Houthis must be designated as a terrorist organization once again.

Last month, the Biden administration revealed that it is reviewing “potential terrorist designations” for the Shia extremist group. Already members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, are urging the administration to do just that.

The move would confirm the shift in the administration’s geopolitical stance and the waning influence on Biden’s foreign policy by progressive forces within the Democratic Party.

In February 2021, just a month after Biden’s inauguration, one of the first acts of Secretary of State Antony Blinken was lifting the Houthis’ designation as a terrorist group.

The decision was remarkable because the State Department’s announcement confirmed that the Houthis are, in fact, terrorists, noting that the group formally known as Ansarallah, was “kidnapping and torturing citizens of the United States and many of our allies, diverting humanitarian aid, brutally repressing Yemenis.”

Still, the war between the Houthi rebels and the government they sought to unseat in Yemen, backed by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia, had become a major humanitarian catastrophe. Progressive figures argued that lifting the terrorist designation — regardless of its accuracy — would save lives.

In those days, the Biden administration was trying to cool relations with Saudi Arabia, a plan that later also went into reverse.

That the Houthis are terrorists is beyond dispute. They have imprisoned and tortured countless Yemenites and foreigners. Human rights organizations have thoroughly documented their violations. They have crushed women’s rights, imprisoning and torturing women, prompting critics to suggest Yemen is headed in Afghanistan’s Taliban direction. They’ve gone after journalists, sentencing them to death before subjecting them to torture, and routinely abusing other civilians while blocking humanitarian assistance from reaching them.

Their insurgency rose out of the remote Saada governorate of Yemen, where the ethnic Houthis practice Zaidi Shia Islam. The Houthis accused the government of then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh of corruption and of being too close to Saudi Arabia and the United States.

Supported, armed and trained by Iran, they adopted the very revealing anti-American and antisemitic slogan, “God is greatest (Allahu Akbar), death to America, death to Israel, cursed be the Jews, victory to Islam.”

The Houthis say their attacks will continue until Israel stops its campaign in Gaza. But, like Hamas, Iran, Hezbollah and other members of the so-called axis of resistance, they oppose any permanent reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians and support Israel’s destruction.

Since the October 7 Hamas massacre of Israelis that triggered the current war, the Houthis have seized a Japan-chartered cargo ship, and they have targeted a UK-owned and operated vessel, among others. They also fired ballistic missiles toward the USS Mason as the American Navy ship responded to a distress call from another civilian ship under attack.

In addition, the Houthis have launched guided missiles toward Israeli cities. American and Israeli defensive weapons have shot those down, but these moves raise the troubling question of what would ensue if a Yemeni missile hit an Israeli city.

Formally designating the Houthis a terrorist organization would provide moral clarity and prevent the Houthis from using US financial institutions and other facilities, and it would be unlikely to have negative humanitarian repercussions.

The brutal civil war that plunged Yemen’s civilians into a catastrophe is winding down after a 2022 ceasefire. Like other Iran-linked militias, the Houthis remain a source of instability, propelled by an uncompromising and repressive ideology.

Their actions, and those of other militias that are repeatedly attacking US forces require a more forceful response. The United States needs to continue calibrating its pushback carefully, but the current level is not sending the necessary message that the attacks must stop.","['sea', 'terrorist', 'tougher', 'opinion', 'attacks', 'militias', 'middle', 'east', 'united', 'biden', 'send', 'war', 'irans', 'iran', 'message', 'houthis', 'red', 'proxies']","Frida Ghitis CNNOn Sunday, explosions rocked the Red Sea¸ the narrow but pivotal body of water that connects Europe to the Middle East and Asia.

429,Opinion: What do you expect when an oil executive runs the climate talks?,"Editor’s Note: John D. Sutter is a climate journalist and nonfiction filmmaker. He is the Ted Turner Visiting Professor of Environmental Media at the George Washington University. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN Opinion.

CNN —

As someone who’s been reporting on the climate crisis for more than a decade, I can say that the most insidious threat to climate action isn’t denial or apathy.

John D. Sutter Beth Mickalonis

It’s doubt and confusion.

That’s why the news from COP28 in Dubai is so infuriating.

The COP — an international peer-pressure meeting meant to avert disastrous global warming — is supposed to be a moment of resounding clarity, when world leaders come together to re-up their commitments to abandon fossil fuels and promote a future that’s, you know, livable.

The message should be clear: The world can and should abandon fossil fuels as quickly as possible in favor of cleaner energy sources like wind and solar.

We have the technology and the political levers we need to succeed.

Instead, the COP28 talks have been mired in controversy and confusion.

The United Arab Emirates, a petrostate, is hosting the talks. The COP president is Sultan Al Jaber, the head of a renewable energy company and also the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.

Appointing an oil exec to run global climate negotiations is not unlike letting the NRA facilitate a symposium on gun control.

No surprise, then, that Al Jaber made some, well, stupefying comments, including that abandoning fossil fuels — which, again, should be the point of these talks — risks putting us “back into caves.” He also claimed, falsely, that there is “no science” supporting a total phase-out of fossil fuels in order to meet temperature goals that are the center of the negotiations.

“Please, help me, show me a roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuels that will allow for sustainable socio-economic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves,” he said on November 21, in the days leading up to the COP28 summit. The remarks were part of a conversation with Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and UN special climate envoy, and were first reported by The Guardian, which posted a video of the discussion.

“There is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5C,” he said, referencing a temperature target from the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

A report issued Sunday during COP28 by the UN Environment Programme and others states that “a rapid and managed fossil fuel phase-out is required” to meet global climate goals.

Al Jaber tried to walk back the comments at a press conference on Monday, saying that he respects science and that the comments were subject to “misrepresentation.” “I have said over and over that the phase-down and the phase-out of fossil fuels is inevitable,” he said.

By then, however, the damage had been done.

Observers are right to question Al Jaber’s intentions and the intent of this entire process. And the public could understandably be confused about whether these efforts are even worthwhile.

That’s tragic, especially in light of the long and frustrating history of fossil fuel interests injecting doubt into policy conversations about the climate crisis. The broad strokes of climate science have been well understood for several decades now.

Starting in the 1970s, fossil fuel companies took a page from the tobacco industry’s playbook and started injecting doubt and confusion into well-settled science. John D. Sutter

But starting in the 1970s, fossil fuel companies took a page from the tobacco industry’s playbook and started injecting doubt and confusion into well-settled science. The fallout of that doubt still haunts political conversations about the climate crisis today. It leads to years and decades of stalled or flimsy action.

It’s also frustrating given that the public has few opportunities to focus on global warming — and the annual COP meeting tends to be one such moment when the world pays attention.

In the United States, only 35% of adults talk about the climate crisis at least occasionally, according to a 2021 survey from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

Slightly less — 33% — hear about it at least once a week in the media.

Not quite what you’d expect given that the habitability of our planet is in jeopardy. We are living with the consequences of a world we’ve warmed today — in the form of wildfires, extreme weather, searing drought and a burgeoning extinction crisis in the natural world.

If there’s a silver lining to the fact that Al Jaber’s comments have been wildly distracting, and disruptive, it’s that there is some benefit to plainly observing the predicament we are in.

Heat-trapping pollution from fossil fuels continues to go up year after year.

There are plenty of people and companies who profit from it.

Perhaps calling for Al Jaber to resign is part of a short-term solution to restore the credibility of COP28 and all the COP meetings still to come. But there’s a bigger point on which there must be absolute clarity in the public mind: We must demand a total phase-out of fossil fuels.

World leaders at COP28 can and should deliver on that promise.

And the public must hold them to account.","['expect', 'runs', 'climate', 'opinion', 'oil', 'fuels', 'phaseout', 'executive', 'science', 'world', 'fossil', 'cop28', 'talks', 'fuel', 'doubt', 'crisis']","CNN —As someone who’s been reporting on the climate crisis for more than a decade, I can say that the most insidious threat to climate action isn’t denial or apathy.

CNN —

Arguments are raging over whether Israel is adequately protecting civilian life in a war that has killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Ministry of Health and whether the world has adequately responded to a brutal terrorist attack in which Hamas, according to Israeli officials, killed more than 1,400 Israelis, raped women and kidnapped civilians.

Jill Filipovic Courtesy Jill Filipovic

Perhaps the last thing we need right now is that we’re grappling with controversy over what celebrities should or shouldn’t say, and how they should apologize when they inevitably botch commentary over complex world events.

Julianna Margulies, for example, has apologized for offensive comments she made on a podcast last month, in which she said she was disappointed that the Black and LGBTQ communities hadn’t come out in full-throated support of Jews in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks and the ongoing war in Gaza. “The fact that the entire Black community isn’t standing with us, to me, says either they just don’t know or they’ve been brainwashed to hate Jews,” she said.

She also said that, as an actress who played a lesbian on TV, she was offended by pro-Palestinian LGBTQ activists who “have no idea that if they stepped foot in an Islamic country” they “will be the first people beheaded and their heads played with… like a soccer ball on a field.”

Margulies apologized in an emailed statement to CNN on Friday, saying she is “horrified” that she “offended the Black and LGBTQIA+ communities, communities I truly love and respect.”

“I want to be 100% clear: Racism, homophobia, sexism, or any prejudice against anyone’s personal beliefs or identity are abhorrent to me, full stop,” she wrote. “Throughout my career I have worked tirelessly to combat hate of all kind, end antisemitism, speak out against terrorist groups like Hamas, and forge a united front against discrimination. I did not intend for my words to sow further division, for which I am sincerely apologetic.”

Somehow, though, Margulies’s comments aren’t the only offensive and bizarre celebrity commentary on Israel and Palestine. Last month, Susan Sarandon spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally and told the crowd, “There are a lot of people that are afraid, that are afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of how it feels to be Muslim in this country.” Sarandon issued an apology in a social media post last week saying the “phrasing” she chose “was a terrible mistake, as it implies that until recently Jews have been strangers to persecution, when the opposite is true.”

Anti-Semitic events have been a stubborn reality of life in the United States, from the defacement of synagogues to targeted assaults on Jews to a horrific mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018. By late October of this year, the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks anti-Semitic incidents in the United States, reported that the numbers were up by 400%.

Model Gigi Hadid posted a criticism of Israeli arrests and detentions of Palestinians, including children, but got so many of the facts wrong she eventually took it down and apologized for sharing “something that I did not fact check or deeply think about prior to reposting.” Several Hollywood figures who have opined about Israel or Palestine or both have seen swift professional consequences, from backlashes on social media to being dropped by their talent agencies.

Others have used more measured terms and mediated means to weigh in. In October, more than 700 celebrities and other Hollywood types signed onto an open letter condemning Hamas and urging the immediate return of Israeli hostages; that same month, hundreds of others signed onto an open letter urging President Joe Biden and Congress to “call for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza and Israel before another life is lost.”

Celebrities have said a lot about this war, some of them far too much. And yet some commentators are nevertheless incensed about the apparent celebrity “silence” on the war – by which they mean, of course, that not enough celebrities are speaking out in favor of their side.

It’s difficult to develop a hard-and-fast rule for celebrity political engagement. Most of us, I suspect, appreciate it when celebrities throw their influence behind the causes we care about, and are pretty disgusted when they publicly oppose the causes we support.

But we can expect a few things from people who are famous for their beauty or acting skills, not their mastery of international relations. First, we can ask that they speak when their conscience calls, not when the pressure to post calls.

Celebrities are human beings who are more knowledgeable and passionate about some issues than others, and also live under the microscope of fame. If they feel called to speak out on a particular issue, good for them. But if they feel insufficiently informed on it, or even scared of professional backlash, that’s ok too — whether Taylor Swift comments on the Israeli-Hamas war may shape the opinions of some Swifties and lend strength to one side of the social media battle but it is extremely unlikely to have any tangible effect on the conflict itself. (Swift has not made any statements on the issue. )

Second, we can also ask that when celebrities do post about politics or world events that they take extra care to make sure that they’re getting their facts right, and that they have at least a very basic understanding of what they’re discussing.

When celebrities post on social media, virality often follows, and their words can shape thousands of people’s perceptions and beliefs. They owe their followers a modicum of responsibility by fact-checking what they’re posting (or, even better, have staffers double and triple check).

And third, we can ask that when celebrities get it wrong, they apologize with sincerity, and reflect on what happened and why. And when that happens, the public can choose to offer them some grace.

Finally, it might be more helpful for all involved to take a step back and ask who it is we should actually be listening to and who we want to be speaking out. There are a great many people who are subject-matter experts and knowledgeable observers and human rights defenders and careful reporters, not to mention millions who are living the conflict as it happens. Most of them haven’t appeared on the big screen, starred in any reality TV shows, sold out Madison Square Garden, or walked in Fashion Week. But they’re the people whose voices we should be elevating in these grave and knotty moments.","['sarandon', 'moments', 'media', 'rules', 'opinion', 'celebrities', 'life', 'israel', 'theyre', 'post', 'jews', 'war', 'social', 'avoid', 'susan', 'ask', 'margulies', 'julianna']","First, we can ask that they speak when their conscience calls, not when the pressure to post calls.

At 5.00 a.m. in the morning, two hours before the announced truce came into effect, an Israeli airstrike killed my loved ones, along with their favorite cat, “Lucky,” while they laid in bed. As they either slept or deluded themselves into thinking they were asleep, shrapnel tore through the door and the ceiling that had shielded them for the past 45 days in Gaza. The very walls that once promised safety now crushed and trapped their bodies beneath tons of rubble.

Only Omar’s body was found, 20 meters away from the blast site. After this “fortune” of being found, the aspiring soccer player was hurriedly laid to rest.

The remains of my other family members still lie unrecovered, while my 71-year-old mother mourns in a pile of rubble, grieving for her tender and loving child. She hopes to shield their bodies from the hungry, stray dogs that roam nearby, fearing they might desecrate the sanctity of her son, his wife, and their precious children.

Days earlier, I was the one to share the news about the death of our cousin with my family over the phone from the US, only to discover they hadn’t heard about it yet. They live just minutes away but have been cut off from the rest of humanity for weeks now. They mourn the departed, yet there have been so many loved ones lost, leaving very little time to properly grieve. In a way, this cheapens the value of human life, where death itself becomes tragically abundant.

While some celebrate the meager number of humanitarian trucks granted entry into Gaza during the recent pause in fighting, it’s crucial to be aware that not a single commercial truck has entered since October 7. Barred from Gaza for two months, shelves of supermarkets remain bare, severely impacting everyone from civilians to humanitarian organizations that are already stretched past thin.

Water is scarce, and food has become so rare that a can of tuna fish would be considered noteworthy, not to mention the tenfold surge in prices for basic items like yeast, salt and canned beans. Cash is useless, leaving people to stand in breadlines, stripped of their dignity.

This is a facet rarely discussed in Gaza – people don’t want handouts, those with money would buy the things they need if only they could find them. Everyone is forced to rely on assistance now and not all organizations can effectively deliver it.

Before I lost connection with my mom, I heard close gunfire and shelling. Mom mentioned the Israeli military destroyed scores of residential buildings around them including our neighborhood mosque, stealing their right to worship, a place to seek solace or pray for the deceased.

This news struck me deeply – I’m grappling with a crisis of faith witnessing a genocide unfold, while my mother living under bombs and burying her loved ones still clings to her spirituality.

When I first began to write this days ago, I was pondering the fate of Palestinians in Gaza, and how life might change if this ruthless and bloody genocide were to cease. Far too many good people have been senselessly killed.

I wondered: who will step into the shoes of those gifted doctors, caring nurses and compassionate medical staff lost in Gaza?

Who will carry on the work of the hardened and experienced war reporters and storytellers who were killed in Gaza?

Can anyone ever replace the hundreds of educators, teachers, counselors, some of whom perished in the very schools turned shelters where they nurtured young minds?

And what about the thousands of students who won’t return to school and university because their lives and aspirations were cut short by a ruthless and senseless military campaign?

Who will take up the roles of the hundreds of engineers, makers and builders who lost their lives in the very buildings and streets they helped create?

And those coders, software engineers, techies, entrepreneurs, craftsmen, chefs – all gone, leaving behind memories and a trail of heartache.

Who will have the courage to dream of a future when the present is so uncertain?

Most importantly, I thought:

Who will fill the void left by the thousands of mothers and fathers who lost their lives due to the Israeli military destruction, leaving Gaza shattered and its people terrorized and scared as long as they live?

Again, I call on President Joe Biden to do everything in his power to stop the fighting and implement a permanent ceasefire, to stop the killing before other innocents in Gaza lose their lives.

These are irreplaceable individuals, not merely statistics or collateral damage but people cherished deeply by their loved ones.

In mere moments, they were tragically taken away forever.

I thought of those individuals deeply this week as I finally managed to speak to my family after two full weeks of no communication. There were numerous tears shed, unspoken words, and silences that seemed to scratch one’s soul.

Now, above all of these losses, I find that on the morning after Thanksgiving, at 5.00 a.m. in Gaza, the world lost a star soccer player. And all of these questions collapse on themselves.

Rest in peace, Omar.

You did nothing wrong. Your only crime was that you were born a Palestinian child.

CNN —

There’s a whole cottage industry in pop culture essay writing dedicated to trying to unpack why Taylor Swift is so successful. Is it because she’s the epitome of Americana? Or the ultimate vehicle for “millennial vibes”? Champion of the underdogs? The final girlboss?

Jeff Yang CNN

In fact, her popularity is anchored in the way she manages to be all of these things, and none of them for very long, pivoting effortlessly from persona to persona and position to position; shedding her skin when necessary (like the “snake” she was famously compared to by Kim Kardashian) to reveal fresh new colors beneath.

Constant reinvention is a given in pop iconhood, as countless prior and peer artists — from Michael Jackson and Madonna to Britney Spears and Justin Bieber — can attest. But no one else does it with the same casual, frictionless aplomb as Swift; her self-shifts don’t come off as acts of extravagant pick-me theater in the mode of Ariana Grande, or explosive artistic statements a la Beyoncé. Instead, they’re more like chord changes; variations in the key of Tay — eyebrow-raising, but never too extreme or off-putting. Which means that throughout all of her evolutions, she has remained accessible, approachable, personable and projectable; a cool hang for the guys, trusted bestie to the girls.

This careful balancing act has been a key reason why she’s stayed relevant across a career of nearly two decades. And it’s why she’ll undoubtedly reach the milestone of best-selling female solo artist of all time (at over 180 million albums sold according to ChartMasters.org, only Celine Dion at more than 220 million and Madonna at 250 million stand in her way).

The truth is, though, simply selling albums almost seems quaint now as a benchmark of Swiftian achievement. She’s now increasingly being spoken about as an economic force of nature, a transformative creator advocate, organizer and innovator and arguably the most influential — perhaps even the most powerful — figure in the music industry.

It was Swift who, in reaction to Scooter Braun acquiring the company controlling her early music masters, chose the almost unthinkable path of re-recording her old albums one by one, creating versions of her classic songs that are now under her direct control. The move isn’t just an act of revenge against someone whose actions she’s referred to publicly as “bullying.” It’s a rebel stroke that cuts at the heart of the recording industry’s power over creators, and one that was only possible because Swift is songwriter on all of her original music, and because of the uniquely equitable contract she signed with her current label, Republic Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. Under the terms of that contract, Swift demanded full ownership of all of her master recordings going forward, plus a royalty of at least 50%.

That said, it’s another clause in the agreement that demonstrates the full weight of Swift’s power: In an unprecedented move that seals her status as a kind of Joan of Arc for creator rights, she said she also got Universal, a major investor in Spotify, to agree that if it were to ever sell any of its shares, a non-recoupable split of those profits would be shared with Swift and all other fellow Universal recording artists.

Swift has used the occasion of her reinvention of her musical past to launch an extended global performance circuit, the “Eras” tour, which could become the most lucrative music tour in history. It will, all in, represent a $5.7 billion boost to the US economy according to the Washington Post, while injecting a profound degree of monetary stimulus into every city hosting her, given that her fans collectively spend around $93 million per show.

In Los Angeles, where she played six sold-out nights at SoFi Stadium, the tour generated enough money to support 3,300 jobs. And Swift generously showered her staff with spiffs, giving each of her tour truck drivers $100,000 in the summer, and providing other bonuses to her sound techs, backup dancers, catering crew and other staff, to the collective tune of $55 million. She can afford it. Already a billionaire, Swift stands to personally make as much as $4.1 billion from the “Eras” tour, according to estimates cited by the Post.

That doesn’t even include the money she stands to earn from the concert film she shot while on tour, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” which in yet another example of I’ll-do-it-myself disruption she paid for out of her own pocket as an independent production, eschbewing studio involvement, and subsequently distributed it via theater chain AMC. It has already earned more than $250 million at the box office, reportedly just under 60% of which will go straight to Swift’s production company, which will get another revenue bump when the film hits streaming platforms for rental and download on Dec. 13, Swift’s 34th birthday.

Many have pointed out that her outsized success has nepo baby roots — the daughter of a Merrill Lynch stockbroker, she grew up on an 11-acre Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania, and her dad helped to boost her early success by buying part of her original label, Big Machine Records. Swift would have had a much harder road in her path to stardom, which began when she moved to the country music mecca of Nashville, had she not been White, a privilege she herself has acknowledged in recent years.

Still, it’s Swift’s undeniable talent, her resourcefulness and her (blond) ambition that have gotten her where she is — that is to say, the very top. I admit to personally being a begrudging fan, not just of her music, but her incredible sense of enterprise. I take mental notes with every new move she makes — and if someone else doesn’t write a bestselling business tome detailing the lessons would-be moguls should learn from Swift’s savvy, I will.

433,Biden administration announces new financial strike force to curb deadly fentanyl trade,"Washington CNN —

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday announced a new Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force to crack down on the illicit financial networks supporting the cartels and drug traffickers that help funnel the drug into the United States.

The new strike force, part of the department’s efforts to tackle the deadly fentanyl trade, will streamline personnel and resources across the agency to better leverage its expertise in countering the financial crimes that back the networks supporting the fentanyl trade, according to the Treasury Department.

“The Treasury Department’s Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force will allow us to bring the Department’s unrivaled expertise in fighting financial crime to bear against this deadly epidemic. Treasury will use every tool at its disposal to disrupt the ability of drug traffickers to peddle this poison in our country,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement Monday.

The strike force will be led by the department’s top sanctions official, Brian Nelson, and the chief of the Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigations unit, James Lee. It will “redouble Treasury’s existing work streams, including using financial intelligence to understand risks and map transnational criminal organization (TCO) financial networks,” according to a news release.

Several key units within the Treasury Department that specialize in financial crimes, sanctions, and tracking terrorist and illicit financing will be part of the new strike force. These include: the IRS criminal investigation unit, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes.

The new strike force’s key goals include combining analytic expertise across the Treasury Department to help identify opportunities to go after money laundering and fentanyl trafficking networks; strengthening coordination on investigating sanctions violations; and creating closer coordination when working with foreign partners on identifying international money laundering networks.

The new initiative comes after the US and China recently reached a deal on curbing fentanyl production, and as the US Treasury Department has taken an increasingly active role in addressing the threat posed by fentanyl.

“The Strike Force will act quickly and decisively with the top specialists from across the Department to nimbly respond to the newest threats,” Nelson, who has traveled to the US southern border at least twice this year, said in a statement.

Investigators from the Treasury Department can access and share powerful financial data with enforcement bodies such as the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Department of Homeland Security as they work to track and disrupt the fentanyl trade and drug suppliers. The new strike force will also help streamline the Treasury Department’s efforts to coordinate with local and federal law enforcement bodies on potential financial leads.

As part of his talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, President Joe Biden said that China agreed to go after the companies that produce the precursor chemicals to fentanyl.

And earlier this year, the Biden administration announced a broad effort to target the production and distribution of fentanyl, which included criminal charges from the Department of Justice and a host of new Treasury sanctions. The announcement built off an executive order signed in 2021 that expanded the Treasury Department’s authorities to target the distribution chains of fentanyl and other narcotics.

There has been a governmentwide push to curb synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, which are the main driver of overdose deaths in the US. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there has been a more than sevenfold increase in deaths from 2015 to 2021, and despite a recent slowing, overdose deaths still hover near record levels and remain the third-leading cause of death in adolescents ages 19 and younger.

The new strike force will not undermine the Treasury Department’s other sanctions regimes, including targeting Russia’s war machine amid its invasion of Ukraine, but rather will ensure the department is “most efficiently” deploying its “limited” resources, a senior Treasury official told CNN.

Yellen and Nelson will travel to Mexico this week for a series of meetings with their Mexican counterparts and private financial institutions to further discuss how the two countries can better target the illicit financial networks fueling the flow of synthetic opioids into the United States and deepen the bilateral economic relationship as the US looks to “friend-shore” supply chains, according to senior Treasury officials.

“Friend-shoring” is a Biden administration goal to strengthen US economic resilience by diversifying US supply chains with friendly countries.","['sanctions', 'department', 'departments', 'drug', 'financial', 'fentanyl', 'force', 'deadly', 'trade', 'announces', 'strike', 'biden', 'administration', 'networks', 'curb', 'treasury']","“The Treasury Department’s Counter-Fentanyl Strike Force will allow us to bring the Department’s unrivaled expertise in fighting financial crime to bear against this deadly epidemic.

434,"Sen. Murphy open to placing conditions on aid to Israel, calls civilian death toll in Gaza ‘unacceptable’","CNN —

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy on Sunday said he was open to placing conditions on any aid to Israel, with the aim of reducing civilian casualties in Gaza.

The Connecticut Democrat, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” that as lawmakers return to the Capitol Monday with the elusive goal of passing aid to Israel and Ukraine, they will discuss how to structure aid to Israel so it is used in line with human rights laws. His comments, on the third day of the truce between Israel and Hamas, come as other lawmakers — on both sides of the aisle — either didn’t rule out the idea of conditions on aid or underscored concern about minimizing civilian Palestinian casualties.

“We regularly condition our aid to allies based upon compliance with US law and international law. And, so, I think it’s very consistent with the ways in which we have dispensed aid, especially during wartime, to allies, for us to talk about making sure that the aid we give Ukraine or the aid we give Israel is used in accordance with human rights laws,” Murphy said. “And that’ll be a conversation we will all be engaged in when we get back to Washington on Monday.”

Murphy has previously called on Israel to try to further reduce civilian casualties and to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, where more than 14,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry there, in the wake of Hamas’ brutal cross-border assault on Israel on October 7.

“I do believe that the level of civilian harm inside Gaza has been unacceptable and is unsustainable,” he said. “I think there’s both a moral cost to this many civilians, innocent civilians, children often, losing their life, but I think there’s (also) a strategic cost. Ultimately, Hamas will get stronger, not weaker, in the long run if all of this civilian death allows them to recruit more effectively and ably inside Gaza.”

But Murphy also said that Israel has a “moral obligation” to continue fighting Hamas following the temporary four-day truce between Hamas and Israel, which is now in its third day.

“Hopefully, Hamas will accept the conditions that have been laid down that will allow for more hostages to be released. But if they don’t, ultimately Hamas is going to be defeated,” added Murphy. “That’s in Israel’s interest, but it’s also in the interest of the United States. We do not want terrorist organizations believing they can get away with the kind of murder that Hamas did on October 7.”

The Biden administration has pleaded with lawmakers to come together to pass aid for Ukraine and Israel, but disputes over supporting Ukraine — and now over immigration policy — have marred the talks.

Some progressives have proposed adding strict restrictions on aid, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who released an extensive list of proposed demands for the Israeli government to receive US aid, including “an end to the indiscriminate bombing,” a “right of displaced Gazans to return to their homes,” “a freeze on settlement expansion” in the West Bank and no long-term occupation of Gaza by Israeli forces, as well as a commitment to engage in peace talks “for a two-state solution in the wake of the war.”

Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet indicated to CBS in an interview Sunday that he is open to supporting conditions on aid to Israel. “I haven’t so far, but I think that’s a debate we’re going to have in the coming days,” the Colorado senator, who services on the Intelligence Committee, said on “Face the Nation.”

House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, told NBC Sunday that while he wouldn’t propose placing conditions on aid to Israel aimed at lessening civilian casualties in Gaza, it is already the policy of the US and Israel.

“I think the White House has been clear, and I think US policy has been clear, of lessening the Palestinian casualties that are not Hamas,” Turner said on “Meet the Press,” adding that Israel has issued warnings to civilians about which areas will be targeted. “I wouldn’t propose it, but I think it does accurately reflect US policy.”

Murphy on Sunday also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s previous policies toward Palestinians, saying, “Benjamin Netanyahu believed that you could ignore the Palestinians, that you could try to squash their desires for a state and, ultimately, that would bring peace to the region into Israel. That’s just not the case.”

He continued, “Ultimately, the next government is going to have to put us back on a path to have a Palestinian state. That’s not easy, but it is the only way forward for Israel, is the only way forward for long-term peace.”

435,"Florida GOP chair defies DeSantis, won’t step down as new details of sexual assault allegation emerge","CNN —

The head of Florida’s Republican Party indicated Saturday he will not step down while facing an investigation into sexual assault, rejecting calls by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to give up his role as the party’s top operative.

In a letter to the state GOP, chairman Christian Ziegler did not address the allegation – which continued to send shockwaves through the state on Saturday as troubling new details about the investigation emerged – but suggested a conspiracy was afoot to leak details from the Sarasota Police Department probe.

“We have a country to save and I am not going to let false allegations of a crime put that mission on the bench as I wait for this process to wrap up,” he wrote.

According to a search warrant affidavit, which CNN obtained from the Florida Center for Government Accountability, Ziegler and his wife Bridget planned a three-way sexual encounter with the alleged victim on the day of the alleged assault on October 2, and “when the victim learned that Bridget could not make it, she changed her mind and canceled with Christian.”

Surveillance video showed Ziegler arriving at the alleged victim’s residence on the day of the alleged assault, the affidavit says. The alleged victim told investigators she “opened her apartment door to walk her dog and Christian was standing outside in the hallway.” The alleged victim said Christian entered the apartment and raped her on a bar stool, according to the affidavit.

“The victim advised Christian did not wear a condom,” the affidavit said. The alleged victim said she told Christian “she was not in a place to consent” because “she had been drinking tequila all day.”

The alleged victim later called her sister and told her she had been raped, the affidavit states, noting that police interviewed the alleged victim’s sister and confirmed the details of the phone call.

Police then interviewed Bridget Ziegler, according to the affidavit. She told detectives she knew the alleged victim through her husband and confirmed having a sexual encounter with the alleged victim and her husband “over a year ago and that it only happened one time.”

On November 2, detectives interviewed Ziegler with his attorney present, the affidavit states. Ziegler admitted to having sex with the alleged victim, but said the sex was consensual and that he recorded the encounter. “Christian said he initially deleted the video, but since the allegation, he uploaded the video to his Google Drive which we have not been able to locate upon a digital extraction.”

During the investigation, police said Ziegler tried to contact the alleged victim via Instagram. The alleged victim then began communicating with Ziegler with the help of detectives, according to the affidavit. In one alleged exchange on October 27, the alleged victim wrote: “I’m not okay with what happened the other day between us”.

“Oh. That’s not good. You are my friend. Known ya for like twenty years now. Lol,” Ziegler replied.

“Yeah I know but that was not cool and you didn’t bring her [Bridget] and then did that to me,” the alleged victim responded.

“She was in. Then couldn’t because no response. She said in next time,” Ziegler replied.

Several phone calls between the alleged victim and Ziegler were audio recorded, according to the affidavit. In one call, the alleged victim allegedly told Ziegler “he sexually assault her” and Ziegler replied, “Those are big words, please don’t, no I didn’t. You invited me in, that’s it. I did not at all, and I never want you to feel that way.”

CNN has made multiple attempts to contact the Zieglers. In a statement Friday, Christian Ziegler’s attorney Derek Byrd said: “We are confident that once the police investigation is concluded that no charges will be filed and Mr. Ziegler will be completely exonerated.”

“Unfortunately, public figures are often accused of acts that they did not commit whether it be for political purposes or financial gain. I would caution anyone to rush to judgment until the investigation is concluded,” Byrd said.

The allegations have not only raised questions about Christian Ziegler’s capacity to lead the party into the 2024 election season but have drawn acute criticism because of the role the Zieglers have played in helping to execute a crackdown on LGBTQ materials in Florida schools under DeSantis.

Bridget Ziegler, 41, a thrice-elected Sarasota County school board member, co-founded Moms for Liberty, a conservative parents’ rights organization that has led the efforts in Florida and beyond to remove books from classrooms they deem inappropriate for kids. She has also served as a close ally of DeSantis in his crackdown on removing sexual orientation and gender identity from schools. She helped author the Parents Bill of Rights in Florida, a law DeSantis signed in 2021 in response to concerns from conservative parents that schools were withholding information about children expressing a change in sexual orientation and gender identity.

This year, DeSantis named Bridget Ziegler to the board that now oversees the Walt Disney Company’s special taxing district in Central Florida amid his clash with the entertainment giant over a state law that restricted how sexual orientation and gender identity could be taught in the classroom.

Christian Ziegler, 40, has also fiercely defended DeSantis’ agenda against national backlash from LGTBQ groups. In an interview with the Washington Examiner, he said Democrats who opposed DeSantis were “perverted” and encouraged them to leave the state.

In his letter to the state GOP, Ziegler suggested that the information made public about the investigation was intentionally leaked because he and his wife are “such loud political voices.” He said the complaint and investigation should have remained confidential until the conclusion of the investigation, and that he could not publicly share his side of the story at this point in the process.

The letter came a day after DeSantis said Ziegler should step down as party chairman, telling reporters “I don’t see how we can continue with that investigation ongoing, given the gravity of those situations.”

“I think he should step aside,” DeSantis said. “I think he should tend to that.”

“I’ve known him. I’ve known Bridget. They’ve been friends, but the mission is more important,” he added.

Ziegler, though, outlined a timeline to remain in power. He told the party that his “role in the investigation is complete” and he anticipated a conclusion to the probe.

“When we reach that point, I will have a lot more to share about the facts, how this transpired, the motive and who was behind it,” he said.","['florida', 'investigation', 'emerge', 'ziegler', 'alleged', 'gop', 'victim', 'affidavit', 'step', 'desantis', 'defies', 'chair', 'told', 'christian', 'details', 'sexual', 'wont']","Ziegler admitted to having sex with the alleged victim, but said the sex was consensual and that he recorded the encounter.

436,Sen. Graham says he has ‘lost all confidence’ in Defense Sec. Lloyd Austin,"CNN —

GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham on Sunday called Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin “naive” for believing further civilian casualties in Gaza could produce even more insurgents and said he has “lost all confidence” in him.

“He’s so naive, I mean I just lost all confidence in this guy,” Graham told CNN’s Dana Bash, adding later, “This is a radicalized population. I don’t want to kill innocent people, but Israel is fighting not just Hamas, but the infrastructure around Hamas.”

Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum Saturday, Austin said he has “personally pushed Israeli leaders to avoid civilian casualties, and to shun irresponsible rhetoric, and to prevent violence by settlers in the West Bank, and to dramatically expand access to humanitarian aid.”

“You see, in this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat,” Austin said.

Graham, on “State of the Union,” disagreed: “Strategic defeat would be inflaming the Palestinians? They’re already inflamed. They are taught from the time they’re born to hate the Jews and to kill them.”

The South Carolina Republican said the retired Army general and former commander of US Central Command “is telling Israel things that are impossible to achieve” and called on Austin to “quit criticizing Israel in public.”

“Secretary Austin, the reason Palestinians are dying: Gaza is so condensed, Hamas has tunnels under apartments, under schools, under hospitals,” Graham said.

Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed at least 15,207 people and injured at least 40,652 others, Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza, saidSaturday.

He added that he understands the theory of what retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal has called “insurgent math,” an idea that collateral civilian death in warfare can be a catalyst for creating insurgents, but argued Gaza’s population “has been radicalized for decades.”

“If we were attacked like this, which we were in 9/11, if somebody called for us within two months to have a ceasefire against al-Qaeda, we would’ve laughed them out of town,” he said.

Graham also criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, who on Saturday during a news conference in Dubai said that “too many innocent Palestinians have been killed” as she met with the leaders of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan during her trip to the COP28 climate summit.

Graham questioned, “What is too many people dying in World War II after Pearl Harbor?”

437,Johnson moves to corral GOP hardliners as tension grows in ranks,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had a bone to pick with the new speaker.

Ahead of the Thanksgiving recess, the Georgia Republican was frustrated that GOP lawmakers helped defeat her effort to force a vote on impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. And Greene – who has publicly insulted her Republican colleagues over their opposition to impeachment – also told CNN she was concerned about a “very serious situation” she experienced with an unnamed “male Republican of the conference,” declining to go into further details.

Normally, she would march straight into former Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s office, where she often got swift results. But Greene said she had a tougher time connecting with Speaker Mike Johnson, who doesn’t have a strong relationship with the congresswoman. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, was supposed to call her before the holiday break to listen to her concerns, according to Greene, but never did.

“I haven’t heard much from him,” Greene told CNN earlier this week.

The pair ultimately connected on Thursday ahead of another divisive vote she was planning to force on removing Mayorkas. Greene said Johnson heard her out and gave her assurances that her impeachment articles would move through committee and on to the floor. Greene then opted to pull her Mayorkas impeachment resolution – at least for now.

The episode involving Greene, the full details of which have not been previously reported, illustrates how Johnson is still learning how to wrangle the hardliners in his conference – a crucial skill for governing over a rambunctious and razor-thin majority that just got even smaller after the expulsion of indicted former Rep. George Santos. Taking a page from his predecessor’s playbook, Johnson has tried to dole out commitments and face-time to some of his potential critics. But so far, the speaker’s strategy has had mixed results.

After GOP Rep. Max Miller gave a searing public rebuke of Johnson’s recent decision-making on an Israel aid package, the speaker tried to arrange a sit-down meeting with the freshman lawmaker, presumably to smooth things over, according to sources familiar with the situation.

The Ohio Republican, however, has rebuffed Johnson’s entreaties, telling CNN he is “very upset.”

“I have chosen not to talk to him at this moment in time. He’s got his hands full with other things and until he can show me that he can lead I’m not going to waste my time sitting down with him,” Miller said.

Asked to give Johnson a grade on his performance, he said he’d give him a “D-minus. I’ve lost a lot of faith so far.”

And then there’s Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus who has continued to create headaches for Republican leaders with his outspoken criticism, questioning what his own party has accomplished since taking the majority.

When asked how Johnson has tried to handle the situation, Roy told CNN: “We’re still having conversations. The question here is what’s going to end up being delivered, but you know, we’ll see.”

But in other instances, Johnson has had success in taming some of the party’s loudest rebels – a sign that the speaker, who himself hails from the conservative wing of the party, has the ability to make inroads where McCarthy could not.

GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida – who led the charge to oust McCarthy as speaker – was among those personally pushing Johnson to sign off on subpoenas for Hunter and James Biden and publicly release the footage from the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, according to sources familiar with the situation. Those early moves from Johnson earned swift applause from Gaetz and the right flank.

And GOP Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, signaled this week they would no longer demand the $1.47 trillion topline spending number the caucus had been seeking all summer, saying they’d be amenable to the $1.59 trillion number agreed to in the bipartisan debt limit deal that enraged conservatives and helped lead to McCarthy’s ouster. The group even held the House hostage for days until McCarthy agreed to back off the deal he cut with the White House to seek even deeper cuts, a decision that has led to the current impasse over government spending on Capitol Hill.

“Certainly some members of the Freedom Caucus allowed their hatred of Kevin McCarthy to cloud their judgment and that misjudgment on their part weakened the Republican Conference and as a result made it harder for us to deliver conservative wins,” said Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican. “So, yes, that McCarthy derangement was real.”

Veteran GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma acknowledged, “It’s a challenge around here, no matter who the speaker is.”

“There is a lot of different personalities. We have a lot of different groups and points of view in the conference,” he told CNN. “But I’m very pleased with how well he is handling it.”

Internal feuds on full display

One of Johnson’s chief challenges has been dealing with the feuds in his bitterly divided party, where members have been in open warfare with one another in the wake of McCarthy’s unprecedented ouster.

Greene has been among the most difficult for Johnson on that front, openly bashing her Republican colleagues and using procedural tools to force a series of floor votes on divisive issues – tactics that have rubbed her colleagues the wrong way and put her increasingly on an island inside the GOP.

“It’s not right. She’s not a team player,” Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican who represents a district in Nebraska won by President Joe Biden in 2020, told CNN. “It’s all about individual stuff. We have a speaker, a chairman, for a reason. We should respect their word.”

After her failed attempt to force a vote on impeaching Mayorkas, Greene lashed out at GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California on social media, using emojis to question his manhood for siding with Democrats to defeat the effort.

In an interview, Issa would not say if her tactics are helpful. “That’s really a question for the speaker. It’s a question for the majority leader. It’s a question for the whip.”

Asked if he would consider her a productive member, Issa smiled and said: “Well, she does do a lot.”

And Greene also criticized GOP Rep. Tom McClintock of California, who delivered a floor speech this week railing against Greene for being “reckless” and “shooting from the hip” with her tactics on impeachment.

“I would urge my colleagues not to undermine a legitimate impeachment inquiry with hyper partisan, hysterical bombast,” McClintock told CNN.

Greene, who was booted from the Freedom Caucus earlier this year for being too cozy with McCarthy, also repeatedly attacked Roy for opposing her resolution to censure Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib for attending an pro-Palestinian protest, which Greene referred to in her resolution as an “insurrection.”

But Greene – who McCarthy brought into the fold in an attempt to keep the congresswoman’s behavior in check – said she has no regrets about her feuds with her colleagues, a sign she has little intention of backing down.

“I’ll remind everyone that I didn’t come here to make friends,” Greene said. She said that any Republicans who are “upset could talk to me anytime they’d like.”

“My position will be that we need to be doing the jobs that we promised to our voters … instead of just talking tough on the campaign trail and then coming up here and falling apart,” Greene told CNN.

Meanwhile, there’s also some unhappiness with Johnson and the leadership team for voting against expelling Santos, even though GOP leaders did not whip the vote and encouraged members to vote their conscience.

“This is just another example of Republicans who can’t lead. And that’s really shameful,” Miller said. “The speaker and everyone in leadership knows that this man is a crook.”

Hardliners could still create headaches on spending

While the far right has signaled it is willing to soften some of their spending demands, funding will still be a sticky issue for Johnson in the months ahead.

The House GOP convened a conference meeting on Thursday morning, which has not been previously reported, to hash out their plans for upcoming spending issues – including how to handle a White House push for an Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and border security package.

GOP Rep. Bob Good of Virginia said the Freedom Caucus made clear to the speaker on Thursday what their expectations are. That includes keeping aid for Israel and Ukraine separated, a plan to cut spending and secure the border, and a commitment not to attach a reauthorization of a controversial surveillance program to the annual defense bill.

“It’s been an effective effort – in conference this morning, and in subsequent meetings that took place after conference – to let leadership know what to put some red lines on,” Good told CNN.

Roy, meanwhile, expressed his frustrations during the closed-door conference meeting, according to attendees.

“I think everyone’s on edge right now, frustration levels are higher,” California Rep. Mike Garcia said after the meeting on Thursday. “So we need to come together as a team regardless of how frustrated we are.”

Before Thanksgiving, Roy gave an impassioned speech on the House floor where he demanded his GOP colleagues give him “one thing” Republicans have done since reclaiming the House majority – comments that infuriated Republican lawmakers and gave instant ammunition to Democrats.

This week, Roy doubled down on his position, and organized a “power hour” of speeches on the House floor to continue airing his grievances. But he also made clear his beef is not personal.

“Mike is one of the finest human beings I know. He’s a good man, he’s a conservative.” Roy told CNN. “Look, whoever is in the seat has got to figure out how to manage all of this. That’s the job. So, he’ll figure it out.”","['ranks', 'mccarthy', 'speaker', 'rep', 'gop', 'corral', 'tension', 'hardliners', 'republican', 'moves', 'greene', 'told', 'johnson', 'house', 'conference', 'grows']","But Greene said she had a tougher time connecting with Speaker Mike Johnson, who doesn’t have a strong relationship with the congresswoman.

438,Shoes and germs: Should you ask your party guests to go barefoot?,"Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.

CNN —

At-home holiday parties are on many people’s calendars right now, and germ-conscious hosts are faced with a dilemma: Should I require my guests to take off their shoes at the door, especially if the gathering is cocktail or formal attire — or the guest is a stylish shoeaholic like Carrie Bradshaw?

In a 2003 “Sex and the City” episode, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is asked to leave her $485 Manolo Blahnik shoes at the door during a New York City baby shower hosted by her friend Kyra (Tatum O’Neal) and soon finds they have been stolen.

“I hadn’t even done a full lap around the party,” Carrie lamented later at a lunch with her friends. The iconic TV character had been forced to walk home in her party dress and old gray sneakers lent by her host.

“Why in the h*ll did you take off your shoes to begin with?” asked Carrie’s friend Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall).

“We had to!” Carrie explained. “For their kids — apparently we drag things in on our heels that make children sick.”

While the episode, “A Woman’s Right to Shoes,” was designed to discuss dilemmas facing single people in a world focused on families with children, the underlying question — and debate — around footwear and health remains: Is there significant evidence going shoeless stops the spread of germs in a home?

“Absolutely,” said Gabriel Filippelli, chancellor’s professor for the department of Earth sciences at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and executive director of Indiana University’s Environmental Resilience Institute.

“We can track in all sorts of bacteria, but certainly some of the ones we’re most concerned about are E. coli that cause severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting,” he said. “There’s been studies that swab the bottom of shoes and something like 99% of the shoes test positive for fecal material.”

Heavy metals and more

However, bacteria are not the only danger that rides along with the dust and dirt surrounding rural and urban homes, gardens and parks, said Jill Litt, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado in Boulder who is currently working as a senior researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, or ISGlobal, in Spain.

“Studies have shown that in urban areas where there are older homes, lead in dust can be tracked into the home on the surface of shoes,” she said. “Other studies have shown that you can bring in pesticide residues from gardens via shoes.”

Heavy metals like lead and copper and zinc permeate the soils of urban parks and streets from decades of pollutants, while pesticide levels can be high in rural agricultural areas, Litt added.

Homes built before 1978 are very likely to contain lead-based paint, which can chip, peel and disintegrate into dangerous dust, experts say. There is no safe level of lead at any age, but children are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of heavy metals and pesticides due to their small size and proximity to contaminants as they crawl, roll and play on the floors of the home.

“For little ones, hand to mouth is one of the primary ways children get exposed to toxic substances and infectious disease agents,” said Litt, who is also a leader of Reimagining Environments for Connection and Engagement: Testing Actions for Social Prescribing in Natural Spaces. Funded by the European Union, the project aims to fight loneliness with natural spaces.

Wet mop first

Before you ask folks to take off their shoes, be sure the home is as dust-free as possible, experts say. Never vacuum or sweep with a broom first, as that will only stir up all the toxins, sending them airborne. Instead, reach for the wet or spray mop. As counterintuitive as it may be to add water to dirt, it’s actually the best way to remove toxins, Litt said.

The same goes for any horizontal surface, Filippelli said, but stay away from feather dusters. “Do more regular cleaning of horizontal surfaces with a damp cloth — that’s windowsills, tables, coffee tables, chair bottoms, chair seats and other furniture in addition to the floor.”

Use the “three-bucket” method if you live in an older home with lead paint or an area with high levels of lead outside. Have one bucket ready with an all-purpose cleaning solution, another to rinse and an empty bucket.

“Some folks also use a very weak vinegar solution in their wash water, which works really well,” Filippelli said. “There are some super sterilizers on the market, but when cleaners are really good at killing bacteria, they’re usually not very good for us as human beings. Whenever you can smell a superstrong smell from something, you got to at least think twice about it.”

Dip your mop into the cleaning solution, squeeze the excess water into the empty bucket, and begin to mop, starting from the farthest point from the door. Work toward the door, using the clean water as a rinse as you go. Flush water into the toilet when it looks dirty or with each new room — don’t throw it outside.

“The highest concentration of germs is in the interior entry way and levels go down as you move greater distances from this area,” Litt said. “Carpeting retains a lot of dust so that would be one thing I would remove if you had concerns about dusts and potential health concerns.”

Carpeted areas should be vacuumed with a device that has a high-efficiency particulate air, or HEPA, filter, not bagless vacuums, and throw the bag or filter away in an outside trash can when done.

Honor cold feet

Taking off shoes at the door may be the best way to limit germs and potentially toxic dust from coming inside, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t think of your guests’ comfort, Filippelli said. Providing washable slippers or nonslip socks can be a thoughtful gesture.

“I do not like to walk around with bare feet inside, so here’s my hack. I have some warm slippers right inside my front door — a lot of other cultures do that as well,” he said.

“Go to any Asian household, or even a Middle Eastern one and there’s often a little cubby right inside the door with washable slippers. You’re supposed to take your shoes off there and take the slippers and put those on.”

Would that have solved Carrie’s shoe-removal problems? No, those were taken care of when she asked Kyra to buy new Manolo’s as a gift for Carrie’s impending marriage — to herself.

“That’s all she registered for?” Kyra asked the salesperson, as her kids ran around the swanky Manolo Blahnik store on Madison Avenue.","['guests', 'litt', 'lead', 'water', 'slippers', 'party', 'right', 'germs', 'door', 'dust', 'carrie', 'shoes', 'barefoot', 'ask', 'asked']","“I hadn’t even done a full lap around the party,” Carrie lamented later at a lunch with her friends.

439,‘The Brick’ is at the center of our galaxy. An unexpected new finding may help unlock its mysteries,"Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.

CNN —

A box-shaped cloud of opaque dust that lies at the center of our galaxy has long perplexed scientists, and observations that reveal a new detail about its composition are deepening the mystery — possibly upending what’s known about how stars form.

The cloud, nicknamed “the Brick” for its visual impenetrability and rectangular appearance, was previously estimated to hold more than 100,000 times the mass of the sun. And such a dense blob should be churning out massive new stars, based on researchers’ current understanding of star formation.

But it’s not.

The Brick is largely dormant. And the latest observations, made using the James Webb Space Telescope, did not reveal any hidden, young stars.

The new Webb data instead unveiled that the Brick is not just made up of gas. It’s also littered with frozen carbon monoxide — much more than previously expected — according to a study published Monday in The Astrophysical Journal. And there’s more ice forming deeper into the Brick.

The findings could have drastic implications for how scientists analyze this region going forward. More carbon monoxide ice inside the Brick could dramatically change how researchers study and measure dark clouds in the center of the Milky Way.

“We are (now) closer to understanding what exactly is happening in the Brick and where the mass is,” said University of Florida astronomer Adam Ginsburg, lead author of the study. “But we opened more questions than we closed with this.”

Among those questions: Why and where is this carbon monoxide freezing into ice?

Other mysteries that loom for this region remain unanswered as well: Why can’t we see any new stars forming? Is the Brick not as dense as scientists once believed? And what are the strange ridge- and filament-like features that show up within the Brick?

“We have more to investigate before we can really be sure what’s going on,” Ginsburg said. “I would say we’re in the hypothesis-forming phase, not the drawing conclusions phase.”

What Webb revealed

Ginsburg and his fellow researchers, which included University of Florida graduate students, first got their hands on this new Webb data in September 2022.

It was a crucial moment. As the most powerful space telescope ever constructed, Webb could offer never-before-seen insights into the Brick. But right off the bat, Ginsburg and his team found the data needed a lot of work. The Webb telescope orients itself using a map, determining which direction it’s pointing by referencing where it is in relation to known stars.

The trouble was, “there’s so many stars at the galactic center that it gets confused,” Ginsburg said. So, researchers had to spend months cleaning up the data, orienting it to line up correctly with the existing maps of the sky.

Then, as they peered at the Brick, they found that the images from Webb were turning out the wrong color.

“All the stars were coming out a bit too blue,” Ginsburg said, prompting researchers to wonder if something was wrong with the data.

But it turned out, he said, the problem was with their assumptions. The scientists hadn’t expected there to be so much carbon monoxide ice — and that was the cause of the color change, according to the study.

Learning of the existence of the ice could have broad ripple effects for all kinds of research into the center of the Milky Way, said Dr. Natalie Butterfield, an assistant scientist at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, who was not involved in the study.

Butterfield said her own research — which includes studying supernovae and the radiation between star systems — could be forever altered by understanding the existence of this carbon monoxide ice. It could change how scientists estimate the mass of all the clouds in the galactic center.

Why carbon monoxide matters

There are several perplexing things about all this carbon monoxide ice. For instance, the area is fairly warm — around 60 Kelvin (minus 351.67 degrees Fahrenheit) — while carbon monoxide typically freezes at 20 Kelvin.

It could be that the dust inside the Brick is much colder than the gas, causing the carbon monoxide around the dust particles to turn solid. Or, Ginsburg said, it could be that water is freezing, trapping carbon monoxide inside.

The answer matters.

All the ice in a region such as the Brick can give scientists new insight into our solar system — even our home planet.

The ice and water that exist on Earth, for example, likely arrived here via comets. So, where ice exists in the universe and how it forms can help researchers understand where these comets come from and how they collected the materials they deposited.

Where are the stars?

And then there is the big mystery of why there is a lack of star formation within the Brick.

Scientists already know that new stars are brewed from dust clouds and hydrogen molecules. But scientists cannot directly observe hydrogen molecules within the Brick — or anywhere else in the universe — because they’re invisible to telescopes.

However, scientists also know that for every hydrogen molecule, there’s likely a certain amount of carbon monoxide. And carbon monoxide is visible — so scientists can measure it as a proxy for identifying how many hydrogen molecules are in a given area.

Researchers have been using this method for measuring hydrogen molecules for 50 years, Ginsburg said.

But they’ve always assumed the carbon monoxide was gas — not solid ice, as the Webb data revealed. This finding opens a whole new can of worms, Ginsburg said.

Ginsburg noted that it’s crucial for researchers to understand what state of matter the carbon monoxide is in — gas or solid — to arrive at the right answers.

Every new piece of knowledge about the Brick and its makeup better informs why this opaque cloud isn’t producing stars, even though — by most accounts — it should be one of the most active star nurseries in the galaxy.

“It’s a really natural place for new stars,” Ginsburg said. “But we haven’t found very many — only a very, very tiny handful.”

There are some possible answers that Ginsburg and other researchers are anxious to explore: Perhaps the Brick is more spread out — less compact — than scientists once thought. Or maybe it’s just too young, and its star-forming days are ahead.

Those are questions, Ginsburg and Butterfield said, that Webb can continue to help researchers answer.

“It’s just an impressive, impressive telescope,” Butterfield said. “I think this is just the first of many unique results that will be coming out of the JWST for the galactic center.”","['galaxy', 'mysteries', 'center', 'webb', 'carbon', 'unlock', 'unexpected', 'researchers', 'stars', 'monoxide', 'ice', 'brick', 'telescope', 'scientists', 'ginsburg', 'help', 'finding']","It’s also littered with frozen carbon monoxide — much more than previously expected — according to a study published Monday in The Astrophysical Journal.

440,Scientists reveal new insights into mysterious baboon mummies of ancient Egypt,"CNN —

To date, tens of millions of animal mummies have been unearthed in Egypt. But while there are millions of mummified cats, dogs, ibises and birds of prey, primate mummies are rare — and little understood.

Now, new analysis of mummified baboons is shedding light on the animals’ place in ancient Egypt, revealing that, while they were prized as sacred animals, their living conditions were less than ideal.

Researchers analyzed bones from mummified baboons, which were discovered in the early 1900s in the necropolis Gabbanat el-Qurud, in the so-called Valley of the Monkeys, to the southwest of Egypt’s Valley of the Kings. The bones represented dozens of individual baboons — from infants to adults — in two species: the hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas) and the olive baboon (Papio anubis).

These species weren’t native to Egypt — they were imported from two regions: “the olive baboon from the south (present-day Sudan), and the hamadryas baboon from mountainous areas bordering the Red Sea, in Sudan and southwards to Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia,” said lead study author Wim Van Neer, a professor emeritus at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels. “The exact provenances still need to be documented in more detail,” Van Neer told CNN in an email.

Of all the animals that the ancient Egyptians venerated, baboons were the only ones not native to Egypt, Van Neer added.

The baboons are thought to have played a role in ancient Egyptian rituals, the scientists reported Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. But raising and caring for large wild animals — particularly non-native species — is challenging. Before their deaths the baboons were sunlight-deprived and developed bone ailments from poor nutrition, researchers discovered. Examination of the skeletal remains revealed signs of rickets; the baboons had deformed arms, legs and faces, undeveloped teeth, osteoarthritis and other pathologies due to deprivation and metabolic disease.

Their deformities resembled those seen in the bones of baboons from two other ancient Egyptian sites — Saqqara and Tuna el-Gebel — dating to around the same period, the authors wrote.

“This excellently crafted and executed study confirms the results of some earlier investigations concerning the health status of baboons in ancient Egypt,” said Dr. Salima Ikram, a Distinguished University Professor of Egyptology from the American University of Cairo, who was not involved in the research. “More importantly, it also establishes the fact that different types of baboons were being brought to and reared in Egypt,” Ikram told CNN in an email. “It is fascinating to think that the ancient Egyptians tried to institute a breeding programme for baboons so that they could both be revered as well as used in religious rituals.”

A jumble of bones

At the three main Egyptian sites where mummies of Old World monkeys were interred, 463 mummified primates have been discovered, according to the study. The baboon bones examined for the new analysis were collected in 1905 and 1906 by archaeologists from the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle de Lyon in France (now the Musée des Confluences).

In the tombs were pieces of dried skin with long tufts of hair still attached, suggesting that the animals had been placed there as mummies. The French archaeologists recovered 23 skulls, 24 mandibles and more than 200 isolated bones, which were assembled into complete skeletons regardless of whether all the bones belonged to the same baboon, according to the study.

Two skeletons had been cobbled together from bones belonging to two different baboons, and one skeleton represented three of the primates. Of the four skeletons that were properly put together, only one had the correct skull. After analyzing the bones one by one, the study authors identified 36 different baboons of all ages, a set with more adults than juveniles and a few more males than females.

The bones also revealed signs of metabolic problems during adolescent growth, including curved shafts, misshapen shaft heads and arthritic joints. Two female baboons had suffered from tooth decay. There were lesions in some of the skulls; two of the primates had shortened snouts, and two others had snouts that bent to the left.

The mummies were also centuries older than previously thought. Based on the mummies’ proximity to nearby ceramic artifacts in the tombs, earlier estimates placed them between the first and second centuries at the earliest, and possibly as recent as the seventh century.

But when the study authors examined bone collagen and fibers from a textile that had been wrapped around an intact baboon mummy, they found that the animals were likely entombed between 803 and 520 BC. The researchers confirmed that time frame using a technique called radiocarbon dating, which can determine the age of organic material by measuring the amount of decay in a radioactive isotope of carbon.

Sacred and suffering

Conditions for the captive primates may have been even worse than their remains suggested, as bones often don’t preserve records of parasites and other types of ailments, the researchers reported.

However, it’s important to note the scientists’ findings don’t suggest that the baboons were being intentionally abused. Their keepers likely did the best that they could to care for the animals, “but this must not have been easy,” Van Neer said.

“Baboons are good climbers and they were therefore probably kept in buildings or enclosures with high walls to prevent them from escaping. Because of the lack of sunlight they developed the metabolic disorders that we see, mainly rickets. There are no signs of broken bones that would suggest the animals were ill-treated physically,” he said.

“Unfortunately, the Egyptians did not know enough about the care and feeding of baboons,” Ikram added. “While trying to give them reverence and care they actually established conditions detrimental to the health and well-being of the animals — the way to hell is paved with good intentions!”

In February 2016, infectious disease epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee was holding her dying husband’s hand, watching him lose an exhausting fight against a deadly superbug infection.

After months of ups and downs, doctors had just told her that her husband, Tom Patterson, was too racked with bacteria to live.

“I told him, ‘Honey, we’re running out of time. I need to know if you want to live. I don’t even know if you can hear me, but if you can hear me and you want to live, please squeeze my hand.’

“All of a sudden, he squeezed really hard. And I thought, ‘Oh, great!’ And then I’m thinking, ‘Oh, crap! What am I going to do?’”

What she accomplished next could easily be called miraculous. First, Strathdee found an obscure treatment that offered a glimmer of hope — fighting superbugs with phages, viruses created by nature to eat bacteria.

Then she convinced phage scientists around the country to hunt and peck through molecular haystacks of sewage, bogs, ponds, the bilge of boats and other prime breeding grounds for bacteria and their viral opponents. The impossible goal: quickly find the few, exquisitely unique phages capable of fighting a specific strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria literally eating her husband alive.

Next, the US Food and Drug Administration had to greenlight this unproven cocktail of hope, and scientists had to purify the mixture so that it wouldn’t be deadly.

Yet just three weeks later, Strathdee watched doctors intravenously inject the mixture into her husband’s body — and save his life.

Their story is one of unrelenting perseverance and unbelievable good fortune. It’s a glowing tribute to the immense kindness of strangers. And it’s a story that just might save countless lives from the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant superbugs — maybe even your own.

“It’s estimated that by 2050, 10 million people per year — that’s one person every three seconds — is going to be dying from a superbug infection,” Strathdee told an audience at Life Itself, a 2022 health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN.

“I’m here to tell you that the enemy of my enemy can be my friend. Viruses can be medicine.”

A terrifying vacation

During a Thanksgiving cruise on the Nile in 2015, Patterson was suddenly felled by severe stomach cramps. When a clinic in Egypt failed to help his worsening symptoms, Patterson was flown to Germany, where doctors discovered a grapefruit-size abdominal abscess filled with Acinetobacter baumannii, a virulent bacterium resistant to nearly all antibiotics.

Found in the sands of the Middle East, the bacteria were blown into the wounds of American troops hit by roadside bombs during the Iraq War, earning the pathogen the nickname “Iraqibacter.”

“Veterans would get shrapnel in their legs and bodies from IED explosions and were medevaced home to convalesce,” Strathdee told CNN, referring to improvised explosive devices. “Unfortunately, they brought their superbug with them. Sadly, many of them survived the bomb blasts but died from this deadly bacterium.”

Today, Acinetobacter baumannii tops the World Health Organization’s list of dangerous pathogens for which new antibiotics are critically needed.

“It’s something of a bacterial kleptomaniac. It’s really good at stealing antimicrobial resistance genes from other bacteria,” Strathdee said. “I started to realize that my husband was a lot sicker than I thought and that modern medicine had run out of antibiotics to treat him.”

With the bacteria growing unchecked inside him, Patterson was soon medevaced to the couple’s hometown of San Diego, where he was a professor of psychiatry and Strathdee was the associate dean of global health sciences at the University of California, San Diego.

“Tom was on a roller coaster — he’d get better for a few days, and then there would be a deterioration, and he would be very ill,” said Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, a leading infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who was a longtime friend and colleague. As weeks turned into months, “Tom began developing multi-organ failure. He was sick enough that we could lose him any day.”

Searching for a needle in a haystack

After that reassuring hand squeeze from her husband, Strathdee sprang into action. Scouring the internet, she had already stumbled across a study by a Tbilisi, Georgia, researcher on the use of phages for treatment of drug-resistant bacteria.

A phone call later, Strathdee discovered phage treatment was well established in former Soviet bloc countries but had been discounted long ago as “fringe science” in the West.

“Phages are everywhere. There’s 10 million trillion trillion — that’s 10 to the power of 31 — phages that are thought to be on the planet,” Strathdee said. “They’re in soil, they’re in water, in our oceans and in our bodies, where they are the gatekeepers that keep our bacterial numbers in check. But you have to find the right phage to kill the bacterium that is causing the trouble.”

Buoyed by her newfound knowledge, Strathdee began reaching out to scientists who worked with phages: “I wrote cold emails to total strangers, begging them for help,” she said at Life Itself.

One stranger who quickly answered was Texas A&M University biochemist Ryland Young. He’d been working with phages for over 45 years.

“You know the word persuasive? There’s nobody as persuasive as Steffanie,” said Young, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics who runs the lab at the university’s Center for Phage Technology. “We just dropped everything. No exaggeration, people were literally working 24/7, screening 100 different environmental samples to find just a couple of new phages.”

‘No problem’

While the Texas lab burned the midnight oil, Schooley tried to obtain FDA approval for the injection of the phage cocktail into Patterson. Because phage therapy has not undergone clinical trials in the United States, each case of “compassionate use” required a good deal of documentation. It’s a process that can consume precious time.

But the woman who answered the phone at the FDA said, “‘No problem. This is what you need, and we can arrange that,’” Schooley recalled. “And then she tells me she has friends in the Navy that might be able to find some phages for us as well.”

In fact, the US Naval Medical Research Center had banks of phages gathered from seaports around the world. Scientists there began to hunt for a match, “and it wasn’t long before they found a few phages that appeared to be active against the bacterium,” Strathdee said.

Back in Texas, Young and his team had also gotten lucky. They found four promising phages that ravaged Patterson’s antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a test tube. Now the hard part began — figuring out how to separate the victorious phages from the soup of bacterial toxins left behind.

“You put one virus particle into a culture, you go home for lunch, and if you’re lucky, you come back to a big shaking, liquid mess of dead bacteria parts among billions and billions of the virus,” Young said. “You want to inject those virus particles into the human bloodstream, but you’re starting with bacterial goo that’s just horrible. You would not want that injected into your body.”

Purifying phage to be given intravenously was a process that no one had yet perfected in the US, Schooley said, “but both the Navy and Texas A&M got busy, and using different approaches figured out how to clean the phages to the point they could be given safely.”

More hurdles: Legal staff at Texas A&M expressed concern about future lawsuits. “I remember the lawyer saying to me, ‘Let me see if I get this straight. You want to send unapproved viruses from this lab to be injected into a person who will probably die.’ And I said, “Yeah, that’s about it,’” Young said.

“But Stephanie literally had speed dial numbers for the chancellor and all the people involved in human experimentation at UC San Diego. After she calls them, they basically called their counterparts at A&M, and suddenly they all began to work together,” Young added.

“It was like the parting of the Red Sea — all the paperwork and hesitation disappeared.”

‘It was just miraculous’

The purified cocktail from Young’s lab was the first to arrive in San Diego. Strathdee watched as doctors injected the Texas phages into the pus-filled abscesses in Patterson’s abdomen before settling down for the agonizing wait.

“We started with the abscesses because we didn’t know what would happen, and we didn’t want to kill him,” Schooley said. “We didn’t see any negative side effects; in fact, Tom seemed to be stabilizing a bit, so we continued the therapy every two hours.”

Two days later, the Navy cocktail arrived. Those phages were injected into Patterson’s bloodstream to tackle the bacteria that had spread to the rest of his body.

“We believe Tom was the first person to receive intravenous phage therapy to treat a systemic superbug infection in the US,” Strathdee told CNN.

“And three days later, Tom lifted his head off the pillow out of a deep coma and kissed his daughter’s hand. It was just miraculous.”

Damaged but not broken

Today, nearly eight years later, Patterson is happily retired, walking 3 miles a day and gardening. But the long illness took its toll: He was diagnosed with diabetes and is now insulin dependent, with mild heart damage and gastrointestinal issues that affect his diet.

“He isn’t back surfing again, because he can’t feel the bottoms of his feet, and he did get Covid-19 in April that landed him in the hospital because the bottoms of his lungs are essentially dead,” Strathdee said.

“As soon as the infection hit his lungs he couldn’t breathe and I had to rush him to the hospital, so that was scary,” she said. “He remains high risk for Covid but we’re not letting that hold us hostage at home. He says, ‘I want to go back to having as normal life as fast as possible.’”

To prove it, the couple are again traveling the world — they recently returned from a 12-day trip to Argentina.

“We traveled with a friend who is an infectious disease doctor, which gave me peace of mind to know that if anything went sideways, we’d have an expert at hand,” Strathdee said.

“I guess I’m a bit of a helicopter wife in that sense. Still, we’ve traveled to Costa Rica a couple of times, we’ve been to Africa, and we’re planning to go to Chile in January.”

A legacy

Patterson’s case was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in 2017, jump-starting new scientific interest in phage therapy.

“There’s been an explosion of clinical trials that are going on now in phage (science) around the world and there’s phage programs in Canada, the UK, Australia, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, India and China has a new one, so it’s really catching on,” Strathdee told CNN.

Some of the work is focused on the interplay between phages and antibiotics — as bacteria battle phages they often shed their outer shell to keep the enemy from docking and gaining access for the kill. When that happens, the bacteria may be suddenly vulnerable to antibiotics again.

“We don’t think phages are ever going to entirely replace antibiotics, but they will be a good adjunct to antibiotics. And in fact, they can even make antibiotics work better,” Strathdee said.

In San Diego, Strathdee and Schooley opened the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, or IPATH, in 2018, where they treat or counsel patients suffering from multidrug-resistant infections. The center’s success rate is high, with 82% of patients undergoing phage therapy experiencing a clinically successful outcome, according to its website.

Schooley is running a clinical trial using phages to treat patients with cystic fibrosis who constantly battle Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a drug-resistant bacteria that was also responsible for the recent illness and deaths connected to contaminated eye drops manufactured in India.

And a memoir the couple published in 2019 — “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug” — is also spreading the word about these “perfect predators” to what may soon be the next generation of phage hunters.

“I am getting increasingly contacted by students, some as young as 12,” Strathdee said. “There’s a girl in San Francisco who begged her mother to read this book and now she’s doing a science project on phage-antibiotic synergy, and she’s in eighth grade. That thrills me.”

Strathdee is quick to acknowledge the many people who helped save her husband’s life. But those who were along for the ride told CNN that she and Patterson made the difference.

“I think it was a historical accident that could have only happened to Steffanie and Tom,” Young said. “They were at UC San Diego, which is one of the premier universities in the country. They worked with a brilliant infectious disease doctor who said, ‘Yes,’ to phage therapy when most physicians would’ve said, ‘Hell, no, I won’t do that.’

“And then there is Steffanie’s passion and energy — it’s hard to explain until she’s focused it on you. It was like a spiderweb; she was in the middle and pulled on strings,” Young added. “It was just meant to be because of her, I think.”","['phages', 'saved', 'bacteria', 'patterson', 'young', 'life', 'schooley', 'woman', 'superbug', 'strathdee', 'phage', 'san', 'told', 'diego', 'crisis', 'husbands']","Yet just three weeks later, Strathdee watched doctors intravenously inject the mixture into her husband’s body — and save his life.

442,"Who came out on top, and who lost out from the OpenAI leadership crisis?","CNN —

The leadership crisis that engulfed OpenAI for nearly a week ended almost as abruptly as it began: With a terse, cryptic announcement by the company that would have enormous ramifications for its future.

In some ways, the outcome was a return to the status quo: Sam Altman would be restored as CEO, with the company’s deep and lucrative business partnership with Microsoft, which took a $13 billion stake in the company even as it ramps up its own AI research efforts, left intact.

But in other ways, the agreement is still a watershed moment for OpenAI and the artificial intelligence field writ large.

The tumultuous week seems to have resulted in a big victory for Altman personally; proponents of widespread AI adoption; and some of the country’s most established elites. And it came at the expense of AI skeptics who, by many accounts, bungled an attempt to make a principled stand for caution about the technology’s long-term risks.

Who came out on top

Sam Altman A clear winner in the whole debacle is, of course, Altman himself. Unceremoniously ejected from his post on Friday, Altman quickly rallied support from the vast majority of OpenAI’s staff, who signed what was essentially a loyalty pledge underscoring the deep rift between himself and the board. His return to OpenAI, in triumph over the board that summarily fired him, reflects a kind of personal vindication that’s only likely to bolster, for better or for worse, his carefully and intentionally constructed image as a charismatic visionary who is single-handedly unlocking the secrets of the universe.

Microsoft Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has sought to downplay the tech giant’s part in the crisis, insisting on Monday — before Altman’s reappointment — that whatever happens with OpenAI, “nothing changes.” Microsoft’s priority, Nadella said, was to ensure uninterrupted delivery of AI technology to its own customers, whether that meant Altman being hired by Microsoft or his reinstallation at OpenAI.

But Microsoft is hardly a disinterested party, having committed billions to OpenAI in a multi-year partnership that’s led to the tech giant integrating ChatGPT into Bing search and other Microsoft products. Now, Microsoft is poised to gain even more influence. Nadella hinted at this reality on Monday, signaling that if Altman were to return as OpenAI’s CEO, Microsoft would have a very strong opinion on how the AI startup is governed.

“One thing I’ll be very, very clear [about] is, we’re never going to get back into a situation where we get surprised like this ever again,” Nadella said. “If we go back to operating like on Friday, we will make sure we are very, very clear that the governance gets fixed in a way that we really have more surety and guarantee that we don’t have surprises.”

Whether that could mean having a board observer or a full-fledged seat on OpenAI’s board, he said, is a bridge “we’ll cross… if it happens.”

New board members In naming ex-Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to OpenAI’s board, the agreement stands to align the company even more closely with the country’s wealthiest and most influential elite.

Taylor isn’t just a former CEO of one of the tech industry’s biggest companies. He’s a former chief technology officer of Facebook, and in 2022, as the chair of Twitter, successfully forced Elon Musk to follow through with his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company, in a momentous bit of corporate maneuvering.

Summers, meanwhile, is the former president of Harvard University who has attracted controversy for suggesting that “innate differences” are the reason for women’s underrepresentation in scientific professions. The remark was widely criticized as sexist and Summers subsequently apologized.

Who came out on bottom

The push to slow AI development In the same way that the deal breathes new life into Altman’s mythos, so does it give a tailwind to the ideology he represents: a belief in the rapid commercialization of generative AI. With some of the apparent architects of Altman’s ouster being pushed out themselves, a casualty of the affair may be the perspectives that those board members espoused. That seems to include a deep fear about the long-term, potentially even existential risks of AI.

In the letter signed by hundreds of OpenAI staffers threatening to quit, employees reported that board members claimed allowing the company to be destroyed “would be consistent with the mission” of OpenAI, which is to “ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”

That OpenAI’s board apparently believed the company’s destruction would benefit society reflects the concerns of a vocal camp in the AI field that has called for pauses in AI development, more research to “align” AI with human-centered values, and concerns about the unchecked power of a truly sentient super-intelligence. Emmett Shear, whom the board named OpenAI’s interim CEO for all of two days, has also expressed similar worries. In the fallout of the leadership crisis, some have argued that the outcome is also a defeat for effective altruism, the movement with which some OpenAI board members are said to be affiliated.

OpenAI does not appear to be on the brink of an all-out AI sprint that disregards risk entirely. Summers has been vocal about AI’s near-term impacts on labor. And after having wowed US lawmakers by calling for AI regulation, Altman will likely continue to be a prominent figure in the global debate over rules for artificial intelligence.

Still, deserved or not, the dispute appears to have done long-term damage to the credibility of certain deep skeptics of AI, and lifted the fortunes of the Microsofts and Altmans of the world who are pushing to get artificial intelligence into the hands of the public. And that may have untold ripple effects for AI development for years to come.","['altman', 'openai', 'board', 'microsoft', 'ceo', 'openais', 'came', 'company', 'summers', 'ai', 'nadella', 'leadership', 'crisis', 'lost']","CNN —The leadership crisis that engulfed OpenAI for nearly a week ended almost as abruptly as it began: With a terse, cryptic announcement by the company that would have enormous ramifications for its future.

443,Democrats accuse X of profiting from Hamas propaganda,"Washington CNN —

A group of House Democrats has accused X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, of profiting from Hamas propaganda and misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war after reports by independent researchers found numerous accounts glorifying the US-sanctioned terror group.

More than two dozen US lawmakers signed the letter dated Tuesday addressed to X owner Elon Musk and CEO Linda Yaccarino.

Citing analyses by groups including the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, NewsGuard and the Tech Transparency Project, Tuesday’s letter said lawmakers were “outraged by the clear indicators that X is profiting from the spread of Hamas’s terrorist propaganda — both through monthly subscription fees collected from some propaganda spreaders, and through ads displayed in replies to posts by both Premium and regular accounts.”

One of the reports in question, published last month, claimed to have identified examples of paid X subscribers sharing videos bearing Hamas iconography and depicting violent or gruesome images. Another report claimed to have identified dozens of paid X subscriber accounts promoting “false or unsubstantiated narratives relating to the war” and that posts spreading the misinformation had been viewed at least 100 million times globally.

“Given X’s major cuts to content moderation staff over the last year, it appears that X has willfully permitted, and benefited from, the illegal spread of terrorist propaganda,” wrote the group, led by Reps. Adam Schiff of California, Daniel Goldman of New York and Jamie Raskin of Maryland. “Such behavior from one of the world’s most widely used social media platforms is wholly unacceptable.”

X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawmakers’ accusations.

A new report released by NewsGuard on Wednesday claimed that ads for 86 major advertisers, including Pizza Hut, Airbnb and Microsoft, were shown on viral posts that pushed false or misleading claims about the Israel-Hamas war. The posts were seen by a total of 92 million users on X, according to NewsGuard.

X released a statement in advance of the NewsGuard report’s publication, calling its findings into question. X could not be reached for further comment Wednesday evening.

On Tuesday, Musk abruptly announced that X would be donating “all revenue from advertising & subscriptions associated with the war in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza.” But it was unclear what content he was referring to and whether the announcement was directly related to the lawmakers’ letter. X Head of Business Operations Joe Benarroch declined to clarify the company’s plans beyond saying the donation would be “a sizeable amount.”

The pressure from House Democrats comes amid a wider blowback to X over extremist content on the platform, in some cases amplified directly by Musk himself. In recent days, X has suffered a notable exodus of high-profile advertisers following Musk’s public embrace of an antisemitic conspiracy theory popular with White supremacists and a report by Media Matters, the progressive media watchdog group, that said major brands’ advertisements appeared beside pro-Nazi content.

Musk sued Media Matters on Monday, accusing it of distorting the likelihood that ads may be shown against extremist material. But some legal critics have cast doubt on the complaint, calling it “weak” and “bogus” in the face of the First Amendment.

Tuesday’s letter also highlights the mounting public scrutiny of Yaccarino, who until now has sought to position herself as a cheery counterweight to Musk’s flirtation with far-right extremism. The letter calls for Yaccarino and Musk to answer by December 1 to allegations that X has amplified terrorist propaganda in violation of its own policies.

It comes a day after the Senate Judiciary Committee said it had enlisted the US Marshals Service, in a rare move, to serve Yaccarino with a subpoena personally, compelling her to testify at a December 6 hearing on children’s online safety. In a release, the committee said it was forced to take that extraordinary measure after X declined to accept the subpoena on Yaccarino’s behalf, in a “remarkable departure from typical practice.”","['hamas', 'terrorist', 'media', 'letter', 'posts', 'musk', 'yaccarino', 'democrats', 'lawmakers', 'propaganda', 'x', 'war', 'profiting', 'accuse']","Washington CNN —A group of House Democrats has accused X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, of profiting from Hamas propaganda and misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war after reports by independent researchers found numerous accounts glorifying the US-sanctioned terror group.

444,"Spotify to slash royalties for rain sounds, white noise and other non-music tracks","CNN —

Spotify’s new royalty system means so-called functional noises like the sound of rainfall will earn significantly less than traditional music files.

In an attempt to crack down on “bad actors” using the genre to fraudulently generate revenue, Spotify announced in a blog post Tuesday it would be increasing the minimum track length for functional noise recordings to two minutes, as well as valuing streams of the sounds at a “fraction of the value” of music track streams.

A sound featuring 30 seconds of white noise has thus far been worth the same as an artist’s original music track, creating a “revenue opportunity for noise uploaders well beyond their contribution to listeners,” according to Spotify, and creating frustration throughout the music industry.

Until now, creators of functional sounds have been able to game Spotify’s streaming system to maximize revenue with minimal effort. Since streaming royalties are paid out partly based on the amount of times a track is played and sounds like white noise are often listened to for hours, Spotify says creators are shortening sounds to as little as 30 seconds (the platform’s current minimum track length) and looping playlists so that the same clip gets listened to over and over again, bumping up streaming numbers and royalty cash outs.

While Spotify did not state how much the platform would be devaluing the streams, Billboard reported that functional tracks would now be worth one-fifth of their music counterparts.

The functional genre includes nature sounds, white noise, sound effects and silence recordings.

“It can’t be that an Ed Sheeran stream is worth exactly the same as a stream of rain falling on the roof,” Robert Kync, Warner Music Group CEO, said in a May earnings call, a sentiment echoed by other music executives.

“Obviously white noise is very different from ‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ but it, currently under this model, is paid the same,” Marina Guz, chief commercial officer at Endel, an AI-driven functional music company partnered with Universal Music Group, told CNN.

Guz explained that there has been rising pressure from labels and artists to change the way Spotify makes distinctions between functional noise and music.

“There’s been an ongoing conversation this entire year of the value of music and how something like someone just putting up white noise is different than paying for an artist that had spent a year in the studio making the album with all kinds of instruments and people involved,” Guz told CNN.

In another attempt to clamp down on malicious behavior, the platform announced Tuesday it is moving to charge labels and distributors by track when “flagrant” artificial streaming is suspected. Artificial streaming is when streams counts are increased fraudulently, such as through bots. The company is also making changes to its royalty system, moving to only compensate tracks that generate more than 1000 streams.

Spotify has also come under scrutiny for white noise podcasts, with Bloomberg reporting in 2023 that podcasts featuring only ambient sounds were accounting for three million daily consumption hours and accidentally being boosted by Spotify’s own algorithm, resulting in a $38 million loss in potential annual profits. Creators of such podcasts could reportedly rake in as much as $18,000 a month in ads, Bloomberg found in 2022.

445,Jack Ma backs off on plans to sell Alibaba shares after stock plunge,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

Jack Ma has put off plans to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Alibaba shares after the Chinese tech giant’s stock plummeted last week.

Two regulatory filings from last Thursday revealed that Ma had been looking to offload 10 million shares, worth nearly $871 million.

But because the company’s stock price has fallen below the billionaire’s expectations, he has not sold “a single share,” according to a Wednesday post from Alibaba (BABA) Chief People Officer Jane Jiang Fang on the company’s internal forum seen by CNN.

The sales were initially planned to take place this Tuesday through JC Properties and JSP Investment, two entities linked to Ma and his philanthropic foundation, according to the filings.

The disclosure of the intended sales came the same day Alibaba reported third quarter earnings, when it announced that it would drop plans to spin off its cloud computing arm partly due to uncertainties caused by US controls on chip exports to China.

Alibaba’s stock plunged 9% in New York on Thursday and nearly 10% in Hong Kong on Friday, wiping out about $20 billion from the company’s market value.

So far this year, Alibaba’s shares have fallen more than 10%.

Jiang said the fact that both pieces of news came at the same time was just a “coincidence.”

The news of the sale had triggered rumors that Ma had lost confidence in the company, but Jiang urged employees to dismiss such speculation. The executive said the transactions were part of a long-term plan laid out in August, which would allow Ma’s office to invest in agricultural technology and welfare projects both in and outside China.

Ma believes that the Hangzhou-based firm’s stock “is currently significantly lower than Alibaba’s actual value, and he will not sell it,” she said.

Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai also weighed in, writing in a comment on the same post seen by CNN that he had “full confidence” in the company.

On Friday, Ma’s office told the South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong newspaper owned by Alibaba, that he remained “very positive” about the company’s prospects, despite plans for “a partial sell-down.”

Ma’s foundation and Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the matter, or whether the share sale would proceed if the company’s stock price rebounded.

The group is currently in the midst of a major restructuring, which was announced in March and originally intended to result in a split of six separate units, each overseen by its own chief executive and board of directors.

But last week, Alibaba said it would rethink plans not just for its cloud business, but for a listing of its grocery chain Freshippo, citing a need to “evaluate market conditions.”

Ma founded Alibaba in 1999. He stepped down as chairman of the company in 2019, about a year before landing in hot water with Chinese authorities for criticizing Chinese financial regulators and banks. Since then, the entrepreneur has kept a relatively low profile while remaining an Alibaba shareholder.","['kong', 'plans', 'shares', 'backs', 'companys', 'stock', 'chinese', 'post', 'jack', 'ma', 'worth', 'alibaba', 'sell', 'plunge']","Hong Kong CNN —Jack Ma has put off plans to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Alibaba shares after the Chinese tech giant’s stock plummeted last week.

446,Solid state batteries promise to radically change EVs. But they may not be the only answer,"CNN —

Electric cars are supposed to be the future, but they still have issues that are keeping away many car buyers. The range is too short. The batteries are too heavy and expensive. They take too long to charge. But a number of companies say they have the technology to solve many — maybe even all — of these problems.

Toyota, in particular, has said it might be on the cusp of such a breakthrough. Other automakers are also working with various battery companies on versions of this new technology.

The would-be breakthrough is called a “solid state battery,” and the only problem is that — much like other vaunted Earth-changing technologies — for a few years now, it’s always been just a couple of years away.

Car companies including Stellantis, Hyundai and Volkswagen have also teamed up with firms working on solid state batteries. The technology holds the promise of batteries that are smaller and lighter while providing more power. They could be safer with less chance of catching fire in a crash, too.

But solid state technology has its own challenges, and it’s not the only way automakers could achieve lighter, cheaper and faster charging electric vehicles.

Battery basics

The main difference between a solid state battery and the lithium-ion batteries currently used in electric cars is a component known as the electrolyte. In a lithium-ion battery, the electrolyte is a gooey liquid. In a solid state battery, the electrolyte is, well, a solid. That solid electrolyte is one reason that solid state batteries might be safer than lithium-ion batteries. If a liquid electrolyte battery is broken or punctured, the two sides of the electrolyte can ooze together, which can lead to an uncontrolled energy flow, followed by a fire.

Generally speaking, solids are also denser than liquids meaning the electrolyte takes up less space and battery cells can be smaller. But some companies are working on other strategies, as well, that can make batteries still smaller and lighter and, also, faster charging.

The main challenge for all of these companies, and the automakers that have invested in them, is how to produce these hi-tech batteries economically in the sort of numbers needed to build affordable electric cars. Meanwhile, there are competing battery technologies for which manufacturing techniques are well established.

It’s a wide-open field right now with a number of start-up companies each working with different chemical combinations and even slightly different physical structures for their batteries. There’s still no clearly superior technology, said William Kephart, a battery researcher at the consulting firm P3 Group

Fast charging times, a key consumer demand, is one challenge for solid-state batteries. Generally, it takes the lithium ions in the batteries used currently more time to move through a rigid material than a liquid, Kephart said. That tends to make it take longer to receive energy, which slows charging times, and makes it slower to release energy — which drags on a vehicle’s acceleration.

Solid-state battery company Quantumscape claims that its solid-state batteries — which use some liquid, but not for the electrolyte — have been tested and can charge even faster than typical lithium ion batteries.

Solid-state batteries will tend to be more expensive because they contain more lithium, which is expensive, said Kephart. Lithium prices will come down as more sources are found and accessed, he said, but, compared to other batteries, solid-state batteries will tend to cost more.

A company called Factorial, which counts Stellantis and Mercedes as investors, claims its solid-state battery technology uses less lithium than traditional batteries, which could potentially reduce costs, especially as production ramps up.

“We think the costing actually will be competitive because lithium, just from the raw material perspective, it’s not a scarce material,” said Factorial chief executive Siyu Huang.

Quantumscape also say its battery design eliminates graphite, reducing expense and, the company claims, greatly reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing.

Other options

At the same time, though, some other battery companies are working to improve traditional liquid-electrolyte batteries, improvements that could make that existing technology better. Just changing the one piece of the battery by adding silicone could yield big improvements in performance at relatively low cost. That’s what’s proposed by a company called OneD Battery Sciences, in which GM has invested.

OneD’s technology allows production processes to stay roughly the same while promising big improvements in performance, according to the company. That means less trouble and expense for battery manufacturers and automakers.

Other companies are working on semi-solid state batteries that combine parts of each type of battery, providing some of the benefits of solid state without completely ditching the standard fluid-based design.

Ultimately, there probably will never be one battery technology used in all EVs, GM spokesperson Phil Lienert said. The type of batteries will be matched to the vehicle and the specific market where it’s sold. It’s similar to how automakers use different engines in various models and in different markets. GM’s Ultium electric vehicle design, which underlies all of GM’s EV models, was specifically engineered to enable the use of all different sorts of batteries.

“When you have a customer lineup as big and diverse as ours, you need to have multiple solutions that can coexist” within the same basic engineering, he said.","['batteries', 'electrolyte', 'solid', 'working', 'electric', 'technology', 'radically', 'promise', 'battery', 'lithium', 'answer', 'change', 'companies', 'state', 'evs']","Car companies including Stellantis, Hyundai and Volkswagen have also teamed up with firms working on solid state batteries.

447,Brands that have paused ads on X amid ongoing crisis for Elon Musk’s platform,"New York CNN —

At least a dozen major brands have halted ad spending on X, formerly Twitter, since its latest advertiser exodus began last week over concerns about antisemitism and hate speech on Elon Musk’s social media platform.

Fox Sports, Ubisoft, Axios, TechCrunch and Paris Hilton’s 11:11 Media all told CNN in recent days that they’d paused their ad spending on X, joining other large advertisers that jumped ship last week.

The ongoing exit of advertisers marks a deepening crisis for X, which was already struggling to woo brands back to the platform following Musk’s takeover last year. And it comes as growing numbers of X users also decamp to alternate platforms. The White House joined Threads this week, giving a boost to Meta’s X competitor.

The latest revolt began last week when IBM said it had suspended advertising on X after a report from progressive media watchdog Media Matters found its ad had run alongside pro-Nazi content on the platform. IBM’s decision also came after Musk had publicly endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory in a post on X earlier in the week.

On Friday, a slew of major media brands including Disney, Paramount, Comcast, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal and CNN-parent Warner Bros. Discovery followed suit, although they did not specify their reasons for halting advertising on X. Apple also reportedly pulled its ad spend on X as of last week, according to reports from multiple news outlets.

X has called on its advertising partners to help protect what it calls “freedom of speech.” The company on Monday filed a lawsuit accusing Media Matters of misrepresenting how likely it is for ads to run alongside extremist content on the site. X also said it had made the pro-Nazi accounts identified by Media Matters ineligible for monetization, meaning ads can no longer be run on their pages. And CEO Linda Yaccarino has continued to tout brand safety controls that the company says can help prevent ads from running beside objectionable content. (Media Matters has vowed to fight the lawsuit from X and says it stands by its reporting.)

But the company has done little else to reassure advertisers that its platform is safe. The pro-Nazi accounts identified by Media Matters remain active on the site, along with other far-right and White supremacist accounts, some of whom Musk had reinstated on the platform following his takeover. CNN on Wednesday observed ads for the University of Michigan running on the page of the X account belonging to Richard Spencer, a known White nationalist. (A University of Michigan spokesperson told CNN the university is “watching developments on X closely as we continue to evaluate our use of the platform.”)

Musk this week also boosted the years-old, debunked “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory that in 2016 prompted a gun-wielding man to fire shots inside a Washington, D.C., pizza shop.

Some advertisers have remained on X despite the hate speech concerns. The National Football League — one of the platform’s biggest ad partners — told CNN Tuesday that it had repeatedly expressed concerns about hate speech to X leadership directly, although it has not pulled its spending from the platform.

448,"Michael Jordan’s ultra-private, ultra-exclusive personal golf course: The Grove XXIII","CNN —

There’s one small corner of the world that Michael Jordan cherishes more than any other — his own personal haven of sporting bliss.

But it’s not in Chicago. In fact, there isn’t a basketball court or hoop in sight.

Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts.

The Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it.

For Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.”

And there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994.

Almost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015.

With Tiger Woods headlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect.

A meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client.

“I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN.

“I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.”

The land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach.

Weed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week.

Weed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants. Watching Jordan in discussion with the team during one early meeting, he got the impression of a coach interacting with his players.

“I think one of his qualities is he was such a good listener, and he absorbed everything that you were discussing,” Weed said.

“He didn’t come out and say ‘do this or do that.’ He came out and observed and was a great listener, and he let me do my job.”

“Slaughterhouse 23”

Weed had his two pillars for a great golf course — an engaged owner and a good piece of property, though the latter would require some polishing.

Turning a flat, “featureless” site – bordered by two long drainage canals – into a cross between the manicured, parkland style of Augusta National and the rustic layout of Pine Valley represented the greatest challenge to him and his team.

Dirt was excavated from lagoons to build the course and its features, fixing the flatness issue and leaving behind six large lakes – the same number of NBA Championships Jordan won. It was a coincidence, but ultimately fit the theme of a course tuned to the finest degree to its owner’s style.

Jordan wanted firm and fast, a course that could both excite and challenge its members, many of whom would be among the PGA Tour’s current stars. A double-helix layout, with a “crossover” at the 5th and 14th holes, offers the flexibility to play continual internal circuits in three, six, or nine-hole loops – ideal for Jordan’s busy schedule.

The course didn’t just need to suit the playstyle of its owner, though, it needed to enhance it.

“You don’t think I’m going to spend this much money and not have a little bit of an advantage do you?” Weed recalled Jordan saying.

Add to that the five-time MVP’s penchant for wagers, which will be familiar to viewers of docuseries “The Last Dance,” and the course has earned a new name among some members: “Slaughterhouse 23.”

“It’s his golf course, so it’s set up very well for him,” former world No. 1 Rickie Fowler told the Subpar podcast in 2020.

Weed, too, got drawn into the wagers, even during construction.

“I can remember us being out there hitting shots and doing a little gambling while we were just playing in the dirt. It was just great fun and interaction,” he said.

“It’s hard not to go out there and play a round with MJ without having a friendly wager.”

To meet the second requirement of Jordan’s brief, Weed’s team set aside 20 acres to construct a state-of-the-art practice facility that the designer believes has no equal.

Two 400-yard, double-sided driving lanes can be maintained for specific conditions, such as US Open or PGA Tour style fairways, with “target greens” in 25-yard increments. Each green has built-in pods that can track swathes of shot information, incorporating the PGA Tour’s ShotLink data.

The putting green is split into four quadrants, with incremental slopes ranging from 0-1% to 3-4% inclines. Even the grass on the tees is customizable, with different types to mimic warm or cool seasons.

“It’s a Tour player’s haven to work on their game,” said Weed.

Taking a swing

Compared to Bobby Weed Golf Design, Nichols Architects had considerably less experience in golf courses, but it did have one key advantage in its efforts to beat other bids to build The Grove XXIII’s clubhouse.

Specializing in hospitality, residential, and commercial design, the firm had worked on the W South Beach in Miami — the favorite hotel of Jordan’s wife Yvette Prieto.

The team pulled no punches with its pitch to Jordan. “You’re not going to confuse this clubhouse with a clubhouse down the road or anything like that, and that’s what we’re selling you,” planning and design partner Igor Reyes told CNN of the pitching process, likening it to that depicted in the “Air” movie, where Nike must lure a rookie Jordan away from a deal with Adidas.

“You’ve really got to make an architectural iconic shape, and a shape that you could almost immediately feel was swinging across the landscape. Hopefully you can almost read the concept without anybody having to tell you,” Reyes said.

The deal clincher — outlined to Jordan in a pitch video — was that clubhouse shape, inspired by the smooth, “almost machine-like” perfection of a golf swing.

Reyes said his team had heard of Jordan’s purported early struggles with his swing, and, in the video, set up a column grid to map the building’s structure onto Tiger Woods’ club trajectory. Jordan was captivated, and told the firm there and then that it would get the contract.

“The first time you walk into the room with him, you don’t want to get too close or anything like that, it was kind of an odd thing,” Reyes said. “But by the second or third meeting we were just talking to him like a ‘regular’ client with a huge amount of respect.

“There was a really a sense of, ‘This isn’t just a guy with a lot of money that wants to do something. This guy knows what he’s doing, he knows what he likes, and how to get to it.’”

The elephant in the roof

Inside, 15,000 square feet of space leaves ample room for men’s and women’s lockers, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, kitchen and dining facilities, and even a shop. Hospitality was a priority, with a below-ground level meaning all service, as well as golf cart storage, can be managed from underneath.

Like the course, Jordan’s identity was stamped all over. Columns were set further inside below an overhanging roof to mimic the hang-time that inspired the “Air Jordan” tag, while an elephant print used on some of his shoes was incorporated into the fritted-glass roof, casting the print across the floor when the sun shines through.

Customization goes all the way down to Air Jordan logos on the ice cubes, as PGA Tour pro Jimmy Walker shared to Instagram after a round at the course in March 2021.

Like Weed, Reyes believes his job was made easier by an engaged client.

“He was involved with a lot of the decisions … we didn’t change a color without him knowing,” Reyes said.

“We have had work with other celebrity people and they won’t talk to you, it’s ‘I just want this’ and sort of like, ‘get out of the way.’ But he realized there was a lot of creativity going on and he wanted to be a part of it.”

“No other place I’d rather be”

Given Jordan’s regular on-site visits, there was no big reveal for the owner when the Grove XXIII officially opened in the fall of 2019, but there was a revelation when Weed joined him for his very first round.

When play finished, the architect found himself wrapped in a 6-foot, 6-inch bear hug.

“He looked at me and said, ‘I’m fortunate enough I can be anywhere in the world, but there’s no other place I’d rather be than right here,’” Weed recalled.

“That’s like the ultimate compliment … to have his own golf course and to shape and mold that golf course for him and his friends, it’s just where he wants to be. It’s just a great spot and evolved into something fantastic.

“He’s going to enjoy it as long as he’s playing and then it’s going to get passed along to the next generation — it’s just one of the great things about golf and why it has sustained itself over centuries.”","['bobby', 'weed', 'team', 'jordans', 'jordan', 'ultraexclusive', 'michael', 'xxiii', 'personal', 'shape', 'pga', 'course', 'design', 'ultraprivate', 'grove', 'golf']","Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course.

449,Six bull sharks inadvertently made their home on an Australian golf course. Then they vanished,"CNN —

For golfers, staying out of the water could be the difference between winning and losing. At one course in Australia, it was the difference between life and death.

Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks.

From their mysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard.

Arrival

A lake on a landlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats.

River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks have organs specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium.

Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s.

Neither did severe flooding.

Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions including in 1991, 1995 and 1996.

The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters.

As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013.

Carbrook’s Nessie

Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green.

There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast.

“The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN.

“It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.”

The presence of bull sharks (pictured, 2012) at Carbrook was something of an urban legend in the 1990s. Courtesy Scott Wagstaff

That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010.

Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat. No sooner had the bait hit the surface, a shark duly appeared.

The stunned Wagstaff snapped some shots before taking a short video on his phone to post online. The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: the viral YouTube video has amassed more than 2.3 million views to date.

Carbrook Golf Club Shark in the Lake

Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor.

A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls.

Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking.

Compared to the crocodiles and snakes dotting other courses in the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents. Only two risk-management steps were taken: warning signage around the lake, and the rejection of any business from prospective golf ball divers, who retrieve balls from course lakes to sell them on.

“It’s just not worth the few grand a year we get for a contract to put someone’s life at risk,” Wagstaff said.

Unprecedented

Fascination spread far beyond Australian borders, piquing the interest of one shark-loving scientist and researcher based at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany.

Dr. Peter Gausmann published his study on the Carbrook sharks, titled “Who’s the biggest fish in the pond?” in the Marine and Fishery Sciences journal in August 2023. Their extended residence, he argued, sheds new light on just how adaptable bull sharks are.

Even without the staff feeding the sharks, hunger was not a cause for concern in a lake 700 meters long, 380 meters wide and 15 meters deep, teeming with fish, from mullets to tarpons and snappers.

Gausmann calculated that the sharks would need to consume half a ton of fish per year – or 0.44% of their body weight per day – to meet their energy needs. Having been juveniles when they arrived, sightings verified they had grown to a healthy range of between 1.8 and 3 meters by 2013.

Only twice before had bull sharks been recorded surviving for years in isolated bodies of water, according to Gausmann, yet none had ever lasted so long.

One group made it at least four years in Panama’s freshwater Lake Bayano in the 1980s, while another survived a decade of high salinity in South Africa’s Lake St. Lucia after becoming trapped in 2002.

A stay of at least 17 years in low-salinity waters — more than half a bull shark’s lifespan — was unprecedented.

“This out of the ordinary occurrence has shown verifiably for the first time how long bull sharks are able to survive in these low-salinity environments,” Gausmann told CNN.

“The study has shown that bull sharks presumably have no limits to their residential time in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers, and they are presumably – at least theoretically – able to spend their entire lifetime in these habitats.”

Vanished

Sadly for Gausmann and Carbrook, the true extent of their survivability remains unknown.

It’s been eight years since a shark was last spotted in the lake. Their vanishing is a mystery, even to Gausmann.

Sightings dropped in frequency after the 2013 floods, leading to fears that some sharks may have returned to the river or died as a result of the storm. Just two sharks were confirmed dead; one found floating on the surface, another killed by illegal fishing.

Wagstaff, who had never noticed any sign of ill health among the sharks in more than 100 sightings, saw them only fleetingly after the fishing death. Gausmann believes it was unlikely the remaining sharks died in a “natural way” due to sodium loss or by any other “anatomical” failure, given their adaptability, and therefore theorizes that further illegal fishing is the “most likely” explanation for their disappearance.

Whatever the reason, it’s an absence felt keenly by the club.

“You can’t help yourself – you walk along the lake and you’re looking in, waiting to maybe catch a glimpse of a fin breaking the water,” Wagstaff said.

“The members loved the fact that their golf course was their unique place in the world where we had sharks; they just embraced it.

“We’d love to see them again.”

Last year, the course was submerged by the biggest flood ever recorded in the area, Wagstaff said. Though devastating financially, closing the club for two months, it sparked hope that new sharks may have crossed from the river to repopulate the lake.

Only time will tell, but Carbrook is already planning for a future without its mascot. Plans are in place to fill in the lake and build a new course there over the next decade, with all marine life – potential sharks included – subsequently relocated into waters elsewhere.

Whether Wagstaff ever spots another fin in the lake or not, he will remember “Patch” and co. fondly as the guests who helped him overcome his fears. Once afraid of the ocean due to sharks, Wagstaff recently went scuba diving in the reefs of the Sunshine Coast to get up close and personal with some large grey nurse sharks.

“There’s this kind of legend about sharks being aggressive because they’re coming into contact with humans, especially bull sharks because of the places they tend to swim – canals, creeks and rivers,” Wagstaff said.

“But then to experience them in such close proximity and see how beautiful they are and how graceful they are – now I just find them fascinating, especially the bull shark.

“They’re capable, so adaptive, and they are seriously beautiful when you’re a few feet away. It’s an incredible shark.”","['vanished', 'water', 'inadvertently', 'sharks', 'australian', 'club', 'carbrook', 'bull', 'lake', 'course', 'wagstaff', 'shark', 'river', 'golf']","Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks.

452,Hornussen: The dangerous Swiss golf-baseball hybrid you've never heard of,"CNN —

To most people, the words Swiss sport and Emmental might trigger thoughts of Roger Federer eating cheese.

Yet to those familiar with the sprawling countryside and farmlands of the Swiss heartland region where the cheese originated, there’s been a traditional game synonymous with the area for centuries.

Sending projectiles hurtling through the air at 200 miles per hour, all rise – and then duck – for Hornussen.

Risk and reward

Described as a hybrid of baseball and golf, Hornussen sees two teams of 18 take turns hitting and fielding the “Nouss” or “Hornuss,” a puck named after hornets for its buzzing sound as it whistles through the air.”

Armed with a 3-meter (9.84-foot) carbon stick called a “Träf,” hitters take to a raised batting ramp in front of a playing area – the “Ries” – some 300 meters (980 feet) long and 10 meters (32 feet) wide. Their task is to strike the puck from the sloped platform, known as the “Bock,” as far as they can down the field.

Scoring starts if they reach the 100-meter line, with an additional point awarded for every 10 meters past the marker. Crucially though, points are only registered if the Nouss lands, with fielders spread at intervals seeking to block the puck from landing with bats, or “Schindels.”

The sport’s format has drawn comparisons to golf, with some even suggesting it was a forerunner to the sport’s modern incarnation.

“The similarity is that like a ball, you hit a puck, and you hit it far away, but here you want to make some goals, not holes,” said Michael Kummer, member of national championship winning team Hochstetten Hornussen.

“People from other countries call Hornussen the ‘Farmer’s Golf’, so I think there’s some similarities.”

Yet while in golf only an errant shot is likely to present any danger to others, in Hornussen, putting yourself in harm’s way is an essential part of the game. With pucks of pressed plastic whizzing towards you at speeds akin to an F1 car, stopping them is a feat as treacherous as it is tricky. Though players often wear helmets and shielding gear, some take to the field without any such protection.

“It’s really dangerous if you don’t see the Nouss or if one hits the bat and, two meters before the face, the Nouss changes direction,” Kummer explained.

“If it goes in the eyes or around the head it’s really dangerous.”

‘The Lionel Messi of Hornussen’

Originating in the mid-17th century in the Emmental valley and, barring brief forays into neighboring Germany, Hornussen has never left Switzerland, with few teams existing outside the west-central canton of Bern.

The need for vast expanses of open grass to contest games forms part of the reason the sport has been limited to the rural area of Emmental, Kummer explains, adding that ventures into Germany ultimately fell short when teams couldn’t find enough players.

Yet for Kummer, it is this very rootedness in Switzerland that makes Hornussen – alongside yodeling and schwingen, a form of wrestling – a pillar of the nation’s sporting culture.

“With yodelling and schwingen it’s one of the three culture sports of Switzerland and we like it,” he said.

Around 260 teams are active across a multi-league pyramid in Switzerland, with the top teams fighting it out for the Swiss Championship.

And as winners of the last five titles, Kummer’s Hochstetten are very much the Bayern Munich of the Hornussen world.

With Hochstetten boasting a number of tall, strong players, at first glance it would seem that physical attributes are hugely influential in a team’s performance. Yet Kummer insists that size matters only up to a point.

“We have some big guys, but we also have small guys and it’s one of the nice things about this sport,” he said.

“The small guys can also make a good play in the field and they can hit the Nouss as long as the big guys.”

Take Kumer’ teammate Simon Ernie; though relatively diminutive in stature compared to some of his peers, Ernie was the league’s top scorer during his team’s most recent title winning campaign.

“He is the Lionel Messi of Hornussen, and he’s also a small guy,” Kummer said. “He’s one of the smallest on our team.”","['hornussen', 'puck', 'sport', 'swiss', 'golfbaseball', 'meters', 'nouss', 'heard', 'switzerland', 'hybrid', 'kummer', 'youve', 'teams', 'dangerous', 'golf']","CNN —To most people, the words Swiss sport and Emmental might trigger thoughts of Roger Federer eating cheese.

454,Bayard Rustin biopic spotlights organizer of the March on Washington,"CNN —

He stood 6-foot-1, weighed 190 pounds and moved with the grace of an athlete. A sharp dresser who favored linen shirts and stylish ties, Bayard Rustin sported a Clark Gable mustache and adopted a British accent that gave him an even more courtly bearing.

There was no civil rights leader who quite looked or spoke like Rustin. He was the Rev. Martin Luther King’s nonviolent spiritual mentor, the chief organizer of the epic 1963 March on Washington and an openly gay Black man who “never apologized for who he was, what he believed or who he desired” during an era when homosexuality was seen as a perversion deserving imprisonment.

“He looked great on a speaker’s platform,” says Arch Puddington, who worked with Rustin in the early 1970s at a labor organization that encouraged Black workers to be more active in unions.

“He’d get up and speak to some of these Black audiences and he could really set them on fire,” Puddington told CNN. “And he hardly ever spoke from a text. I would write text for him, and he would just completely ignore it.”

The man who organized what was then the largest peacetime protest in American history eventually became known as the movement’s “unsung hero,” largely fading into obscurity by his death in 1987.

But now Rustin is returning to the spotlight. “Rustin,” a biopic that depicts how Rustin navigated a gantlet of personal and political hurdles to pull off the March on Washington, debuts on Netflix today.

The film, made by Barack and Michelle Obama’s production company, comes amid a mini-Rustin renaissance. Recent months have also brought a new musical, “Bayard Rustin: Inside Ashland,” and a new book, “Bayard Rustin: A Legacy of Protest and Politics,” edited by Michael G. Long.

The new film is a good introduction to Rustin, and how social change takes place. Directed by George C. Wolfe, it crackles with energy. The actor Colman Domingo captures much of Rustin’s charisma and shrewd intelligence. The movie also reveals how some of the biggest battles civil rights leaders fought to put on the march were with one another, over turf and ego.

Much of the film’s urgency is a result of its tight focus. It’s structured around Rustin’s frantic campaign to organize the march, showing how he and 200 volunteers summoned 250,000 demonstrators to Washington with only two months for planning. They did so during an era of clattering typewriters, landline telephones and mimeograph machines — long before the internet or social media existed.

“It was the greatest moment in my life,” Rustin said in an oral history of the civil rights movement called “Voices of Freedom.”

It was one of the greatest moments in American history as well. The film, though, offers something more than a history lesson. It offers at least three lessons on leadership and social change.

Lesson 1: Character counts more than charisma

Character, it’s been said, is who you are when no one is watching. Rustin’s film, and his life, illustrates that lesson in several ways.

The civil rights movement was full of charismatic speakers. Yet many of its greatest leaders defined themselves not by what they said on camera, but by the decisions they made in private.

Malcolm X, for example, could fire up a crowd like few others. But his decision to break with Elijah Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam, helped seal his greatness. He knew his decision would likely cost him his life, but he was willing to take that chance because of his integrity.

King’s decision to oppose the Vietnam War was also widely unpopular. He lost the support of an American president, Black leaders turned against him and donations to the civil rights organization he co-founded dried up. But he did so because, like Malcolm, he shared a core commitment to his integrity.

Many pivotal moments in “Rustin,” and in the activist’ life, come down to the same moral calculus.

In a tense, private meeting depicted in the film, A. Philip Randolph (magnificently played by actor Glynn Turman) stands up for Rustin when other civil rights leaders tried to get him booted from the march because of his sexual orientation.

Rustin earned the respect of people like Randolph and King in part because of what he did when the cameras weren’t turned toward him.

He was a pacifist who went to prison during World War II rather than violate his beliefs. He did time on a chain gang and was viciously beaten several times for his activism but refused to retaliate because of his belief in nonviolence.

He also spent time in India studying Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolence, which he later passed on to King — leading some to call him the “American Gandhi.”

Rustin was deeply involved in virtually every major civil rights struggle of the mid-20th century, when many of those movements weren’t popular or covered by the press.

“He [Rustin] established a standard for honesty and fortitude that was unusually high in his era and much needed in ours,” Puddington wrote in one essay about Rustin.

Rustin’s character could also be seen in the way he handled his sexual orientation: no apologies; no double life.

During one scene of the film, he tells King he’s not going to hide who he is from other civil rights leaders.

“On the day I was born Black, I was also born a homosexual,” he says. “They either believe in freedom and justice for all or they do not.”

Lesson 2: Every movement needs a ‘glue’ person

General Omar Bradley, an American commander during World War II, is known to have said: “Amateurs talk strategy and professionals talk logistics.”

Bradley’s quote may be apocryphal, but it reflects a truism in warfare. The best-supplied armies often win. Battlefield victories often result not from clever strategies but from logistics — making sure troops have enough supplies and working equipment.

The same principle applies in sports. In the NBA, for example, there are certain unglamorous players on championship teams known as “glue guys.” They do the dirty work of setting screens, delivering hard fouls, rebounding and playing defense.

Rustin was the “glue guy” leader for the civil rights movement. Every movement needs one.

Rustin was a great organizer because he paid attention to details. He knew how many sandwiches and portable bathrooms the March on Washington participants needed. He knew how to raise money, how to charter buses to Washington and how to negotiate with sound engineers to make sure King’s voice could be heard across the Mall when he delivered his climatic “I Have a Dream” speech.

Watching Rustin organize the march in the film felt more exciting than the film’s depiction of the march itself.

There’s a scene in the movie where Ella Baker, one of the leaders of the civil rights movement who never got her due because of her gender, tells Rustin about the Ying and Yang every movement needs: a person in front and a logistical master behind the scenes. She sees that in Rustin’s partnership with King.

“On your own, you and Martin are fine,” she tells Rustin. “But together, you are fire.”

Lesson 3: Action without hope is impossible

The author Rebecca Solnit once wrote: “Hope calls for action; action is impossible without hope.”

Solnit says some of the biggest enemies of social change are cynicism and pessimism. Opponents of movements often try to convince demonstrators that they have no reason to expect they could win.

But Rustin had an ability to inspire marginalized people to believe they could win. One of the best passages in the film shows him molding a group of young, Black, brown and White civil rights activists into the crack team that would organize the March on Washington.

Rustin’s exuberance reflected the spirit of his time. He lived in another America full of can-do spirit. The country had defeated fascism during World War II; rebuilt Europe, pledged to send a man to the moon and wipe out poverty with President’s Johnson’s Great Society program. That optimism seeps through the movie.

Some of that patriotism may seem naïve now, but it furnished the civil rights movement with tremendous vitality. There are scenes in the film of Rustin mobilizing his young volunteers that conjure memoires of former President Obama’s first campaign, when young people across America bonded together for “hope and change.”

At one point in the film, a young organizer proposes a wild idea, and while others shout the person down, Rustin praises the volunteer.

“Don’t stifle an impulse before it’s born,” he shouts with a huge smile.

Optimism was a core organizing principle for Rustin, says Puddington, who is also a senior scholar emeritus at the Freedom House, a group that defends human rights and promotes democratic change throughout the world.

“Bayard was among those rare individuals who believed that if your cause was just and you had access to the basic tools of democracy, your time would come,” Puddington wrote in an essay about Rustin.

“For gay people today who live in democratic settings, Bayard’s optimism has been validated with each new victory for equality.”

Rustin refused to be defined by his race or sexual orientation

There is one risk that comes with renewed appreciation of Rustin: It’s easy to short-change his complexity. He’s invariably defined primarily through his sexual orientation – something his enemies often did.

But Rustin said his faith as a Quaker was central to his identity.

“My activism did not spring from my being Black,” he once said. “It is rooted fundamentally in my Quaker upbringing.”

This April 1969 file photo shows Rustin in his Park Avenue office in New York City. A Quaker and a pacifist, Rustin served as chief strategist for Martin Luther King's march but was kept mostly in the background because some organizers considered him a liability. A. Camerano/AP

Rustin said those Quaker values were built “on the concept of a single human family,” and that racial injustice was a challenge to that belief.

“It demanded my involvement in the struggle to achieve interracial democracy, “he said, “but it is very likely that I would have been involved had I been a White person with the same philosophy.”

Rustin has been called many labels: a great civil rights activist, a gay pioneer, an “American Gandhi,” and “Mr. March on Washington.” Maybe it’s time we call simply describe him the way the author Cathy Young once did in an essay:

As “a great American and a true hero.”

456,Water at Kealia pond in Hawaii has turned pink amid drought,"CNN —

A pond in Hawaii looks like something right out of a fairy tale. Water at the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge, one of the few coastal salt marshes on the island of Maui, has been bright pink since at least October 30, officials say, after its salt content surged amid an extreme drought.

Water samples sent to the University of Hawaii suggest that halobacteria is behind the pond’s new magenta hue, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

Halobacteria are single-celled organisms that thrive in very salty water, like the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. The bacterium is considered a so-called extremophile because of its ability to live in such an extreme environment – in this case, one where the water salinity is twice that of seawater, Fish and Wildlife noted.

While Kealia literally means “salt encrustation,” the pond’s salinity has skyrocketed well beyond normal because of Maui’s extreme drought. The entire island is in severe or worse drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. The area where the Kealia Pond refuge is located is in what’s considered an extreme drought – the second-worst on the Drought Monitor’s scale.

The Waikapu Stream, which brings water from the West Maui Mountains down into the Kealia Pond, also flows through the area of extreme drought. Less freshwater input into the pond has driven the salt concentration up and provided a cozy haven for the brightly hued halobacteria.

Around 90% of Maui County, which includes other islands, is in at least severe drought – one that has grown even worse since a deadly wildfire ripped through Lahaina in August.

Scientists are still studying how the climate crisis will affect Hawaii, but overall there is confidence drought will get worse as global temperature increases – even in tropical areas such as this.","['water', 'pond', 'maui', 'kealia', 'drought', 'extreme', 'hawaii', 'salt', 'pink', 'turned', 'worse', 'amid', 'wildlife']","Water at the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge, one of the few coastal salt marshes on the island of Maui, has been bright pink since at least October 30, officials say, after its salt content surged amid an extreme drought.

457,"China blames Canada for ‘malicious, provocative’ moves after close midair intercepts over South China Sea","Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Hong Kong CNN —

China has accused Canada of carrying out “malicious and provocative” actions in the South China Sea, after the Canadian Navy said Chinese fighter jets endangered a helicopter in two close intercepts above international waters.

The comments come after CNN revealed last week that a Chinese warplane fired flares in front of a Canadian military helicopter on October 29, an operation that Canadian military officers said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft.

The incident was the second of two “unsafe” encounters the Canadian chopper had on that day with Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy J-11 fighters, which got as close as 100 feet (30 meters) from the helicopter, Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, told CNN in an interview on the warship.

Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair briefed reporters on the incidents later Friday, saying the Chinese jets’ actions were deemed to be “significantly unsafe” and put “the safety of all personnel involved in unnecessary risk.”

Canada said both incidents took place in international waters within the South China Sea.

China’s Defense Ministry hit back on Saturday, accusing Canada of violating Chinese and international laws, jeopardizing China’s sovereignty and security, and conducting “malicious and provocative act with ulterior motives.”

Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesperson for the Chinese Defense Ministry, said Canada’s HMCS Ottawa frigate flew two helicopter sorties with “unknown intentions” toward China’s airspace around the Xisha Islands – a disputed archipelago claimed by China, Vietnam and Taiwan and also known as the Paracel Islands.

“China’s People’s Liberation Army organized naval and air forces to conduct identification, verification in accordance with the law and issued multiple warnings. However, the Canadian helicopter not only refused to respond, but also took provocative actions such as flying at ultra-low altitudes,” Zhang said in a statement posted on the ministry’s website.

“We urge the Canadian side not to ignore the facts, stop exaggerating and hyping up (the incident), and to strictly restrict the actions of its frontline naval and air forces to prevent accidents at sea and in the air,” he added.

Millen, the Canadian air commander, told CNN he was piloting the helicopter on October 29, when Chinese J-11s intercepted it at close range while it flew straight and level at 3,000 feet above the water back toward the Ottawa, a signal to the Chinese that it had no hostile intent.

He said he had to descend to 200 feet – an area where the helicopter can operate but is “very uncomfortable for fast air fighter jets” – to end the “unsafe” encounter with Chinese jets.

The Chinese fighters flew in circles so close that his helicopter experienced turbulence coming off the jets, which posed a danger to the copter, Millen said.

China claims historic jurisdiction over almost the entirety of the vast South China Sea, which is a resource rich and vital international shipping route. Since 2014 Beijing has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants.

In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling and Western powers routinely conduct naval passages through the sea to uphold the claim that it is an international waterway.

The latest incidents are the second risky midair intercept Canada has accused China of conducting last month.

In mid-October, a Chinese fighter jet came within 5 meters (16 feet) of a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance and surveillance plane over the East China Sea.

That incident was recorded by news crews aboard the Canadian aircraft and witnessed by Maj. Gen. Iain Huddleston, the commander of Canada’s 1st Air Division, who was also on the plane.

Huddleston called the intercept “unprofessional” and “very aggressive” in a report from Radio Canada, which was on the plane.

“The Canadian aircraft was subject to multiple close-proximity maneuvers by a PLAAF aircraft that put the safety of all personnel at risk,” Canada’s Defense Ministry said in a statement.

China’s Foreign Ministry said the Canadian plane illegally entered Chinese airspace and accused the Canadian military of sending “warplanes halfway around the world to stir up trouble and make provocations at China’s doorsteps.”","['malicious', 'midair', 'close', 'helicopter', 'sea', 'intercepts', 'canada', 'chinese', 'international', 'china', 'air', 'south', 'moves', 'jets', 'provocative', 'canadian', 'ministry']","Hong Kong CNN —China has accused Canada of carrying out “malicious and provocative” actions in the South China Sea, after the Canadian Navy said Chinese fighter jets endangered a helicopter in two close intercepts above international waters.

458,Caster Semenya says she went through ‘hell’ due to testosterone limits imposed on female athletes,"CNN —

South Africa’s two-time Olympic champion Caster Semenya told CNN that having to take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete internationally was “hell” and had a negative impact on her health.

In her new book, “The Race To Be Myself,’ Semenya describes the damaging impact the medication had on her body and now says she wants to use her platform to stop other women having to endure the same thing.

“I would say it was hell because each and every day you live under stress,” Semenya told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga, speaking about taking the medication.

The runner has been at the forefront of controversy. She has been supported by athletes of world renown like tennis great Martina Navratilova but British runner Lynsey Sharp tearfully said how “difficult” it was for her and others to compete against Semenya.

Sharp broke down in tears after watching Semenya storm away to victory at the Rio Olympics in 2016.

Semenya is hyperandrogenous – meaning she has naturally high levels of testosterone – and is fighting against new rules introduced in 2019 by track and field’s governing body World Athletics (WA) – and previously known as the IAAF – that regulate levels of the hormone in female athletes.

In July this year, Semenya won an appeal which she had submitted to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to end the testosterone limits.

“You are not happy within; you are never happy. It makes you feel sick, nauseous. You have panic attacks. It starts creating a little bit of blood clots in your system,” Semenya says.

“Your stomach is burning. You eat a lot. You can’t sleep. You sweat a lot each and every day.

“It’s like digging a hole that you can never fill up. You know, it’s like you measure a casket and you get in and then you bury yourself. It was not easy. It was a hard time.”

Caster Semenya was one of the most dominant runners in the world during her prime. Cameron Spencer/Getty Images

In a statement to CNN, World Athletics said it stood by its rules and research.

“World Athletics has over a decade of research, directly from DSD athletes in our own sport, that show high testosterone levels do provide an unfair advantage in the female category,” World Athletics said.

“The research also shows that the frequency of DSD individuals in the elite athlete population is around 140 times higher than you will find in the general female population. This is why our guidelines on testosterone thresholds are necessary, reasonable, and proportionate to protect the integrity of the female category and have been upheld by two Courts.

“If we don’t protect the female category, then women and young girls will not choose sport.”

Inconclusive impact on performance

Semenya won the 800m gold medal at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics Games, but the rules introduced by World Athletics in 2019 meant she would need to take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete internationally over distances between 400m and one mile – something she has declined to do. She was unable to defend her 800m crown in Tokyo in 2021 because of the rule changes.

Variations in people’s reproductive anatomy, chromosome patterns or other traits that may not align with typical binary definitions of female or male are what is defined as differences in sex development (DSD).

It is difficult to estimate how many people have DSD traits – many live their entire lives without ever knowing they have one. Scientists estimate as many as one out of every 50 people is born with DSD traits.

Semenya acknowledged the differences in her body but insisted DSD athletes did not have an unfair advantage in the sport.

“I’m born a woman, but I’m a woman with no uterus. I have no fallopian tubes. I don’t go through menstruation,” Semenya said.

“Yes, I’m different, but it doesn’t make me less of a woman.”

“I am here where I am because of dedication, hard work, discipline and all those things,” she added.

“But then is it considered a threat to a man in sport because, when a woman does great, it becomes a problem. But when a man does good, they’re phenomenal.

“But genetically, it’s something that you can say you cannot control it.”

Semenya has been locked in a battle with World Athletics – notably with its president Sebastian Coe – for almost a decade over the issue of testosterone regulation and lost appeals against the ruling in both 2019 and 2020.

The science on the matter is not entirely conclusive.

Retired endocrinologist Peter Sonksen told CNN in 2021 that “there is good evidence to show muscle bulk increases with increasing dosage of testosterone,” but added that the relationship between blood testosterone level and performance remains “complex and controversial.”

New chapter

Semenya, 32, said she felt ready to write a book about her life, but admitted facing questions about her gender at an early age was difficult.

In the book, she said she was 18 when she first faced scrutiny from World Athletics, then known as the IAAF.

Semenya described the moment as “life-changing.”

“You are 18 years of age and then you get asked if you are not woman enough. Your entire childhood you have been a woman, regardless of the differences that you have in your body,” she said.

“But I think for me, what I had to turn around was the humiliation, you know, the injustice and people treating me with no respect.

“I think the importance for me was knowing who I am, my identity and carrying that to represent my country.”

Semenya said she would continue to “advocate for what is right” for women’s sport, proof that one of the most dominant athletes of her time has not turned her back on the sport she loves quite yet.","['female', 'athletes', 'athletics', 'caster', 'dsd', 'testosterone', 'imposed', 'hell', 'world', 'cnn', 'woman', 'sport', 'body', 'went', 'semenya', 'limits']","In July this year, Semenya won an appeal which she had submitted to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to end the testosterone limits.

459,"Exclusive: Chinese jet fired flares close to submarine-hunting helicopter in South China Sea, Canadian Navy says","Aboard HMCS Ottawa CNN —

A Chinese warplane fired flares in front of a Canadian military helicopter over international waters of the South China Sea last Sunday, an operation that Canadian military officers said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft.

“The risk to a helicopter in that instance is the flares moving into the rotor blades or the engines so this was categorized as both unsafe and non-standard, unprofessional,” said Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, the warship from which the Sikorsky Cyclone helicopter was flying.

The incident was the second of two encounters the Ottawa’s helicopter had with Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy J-11 fighter jets over international waters on October 29, which saw the fighters get as close as 100 feet from the helicopter, Millen told CNN in an interview aboard the warship.

He said that Canada and other nations have seen Chinese aircraft get close to fixed-wing aircraft on numerous occasions, but it was rare to see such action taken against a helicopter.

The first incident was over international waters outside of 34 miles from the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the South China Sea. The second was also over international waters outside of 23 miles from the Paracels. The warship was operating in international waters 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of the Paracels at the time.

The Canadian helicopter was searching for a previously detected submarine when the incidents occurred, officers aboard the Ottawa said.

Millen said he was piloting the Canadian helicopter earlier in the day, when Chinese J-11s intercepted it at close range while it flew straight and level at 3,000 feet above the water back toward the Ottawa, a signal to the Chinese that it had no hostile intent.

In that earlier encounter, Millen said the Chinese fighters flew in circles around his helicopter.

“When the intercepting aircraft was closer and closer, at a certain point it became unsafe,” he said.

His helicopter experienced turbulence coming off the Chinese jets, also posing a danger to the copter, Millen said.

“I certainly am not as comfortable as you can be based on the fragility of the rotor system,” he said.

Millen said he ended that encounter by descending to 200 feet, an area where the helicopter can operate but is “very uncomfortable for fast air fighter jets.”

The Canadian air force major said his military’s air crews train on how to respond to such intercepts as occurred on Sunday and will continue to fly over the international waters of the South China Sea.

Asked about the interception at a regular press briefing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”

“We have reiterated many times our firm position on Canadian warplanes conducting reconnaissance near China’s territorial airspace,” he told reporters. “We hope Canada will refrain from its inappropriate behavior to avoid the situation from becoming more complicated.”

CNN has also reached to China’s Defense Ministry for comment.

China claims historic jurisdiction over almost the entirety of the vast South China Sea, and since 2014 has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants. The Paracels, called the Xisha Islands by China, are in the northern part of the South China Sea, east of Da Nang, Vietnam, and south of China’s Hainan Island.

The 1.3-million-square-mile waterway is vital to international trade, with an estimated third of global shipping worth trillions of dollars passing through each year. It’s also home to vast fertile fishing grounds upon which many lives and livelihoods depend.

In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling.

Freedom of navigation



Major western powers frequently conduct passage across the sea in order to assert that the region is international waters, sparking Beijing’s ire.

The Ottawa had been patrolling the waterway since last Monday, at times operating with United States, Australian, Japanese and New Zealand naval vessels and aircraft in a multinational exercise dubbed Noble Caribou. However, it was operating alone when the encounters with the Chinese jets.

The Ottawa and the US Navy destroyer USS Rafael Peralta overnight Wednesday into Thursday local time continued their deployment into the Taiwan Strait, another international waterway and vital shipping channel that has seen tense

encounters between PLA and allied vessels.

Last June, the US Navy reported a close encounter between the destroyer USS Chung-Hoon and a Chinese warship during a Taiwan Strait transit, in which the US warship slowed down to avoid colliding with the Chinese navy vessel that cut in front of it. The Canadian frigate HMCS Montreal was accompanying the US ship at the time, and a news crew aboard it recorded the incident.

Then Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu blamed the US for ratcheting up tensions in the region when questioned by reporters at a defense conference in Singapore.

“They are not here for innocent passage, they are here for provocation,” Li said of US warships.

Li said if the US and other foreign powers did not want confrontation, they should not send their military assets near China.

“Mind your own business,” Li said, adding, “Why did all these incidents happen in areas near China, not in areas near other countries?”

This week’s passage of the allied warships through the strait was uneventful, however, with no contact reported.

Sunday’s incidents come after other reports of unsafe intercepts of allied aircraft in the recent days.

On Tuesday, a PLA fighter jet came within 10 feet of a US Air Force B-52 bomber flying over the South China Sea, the US military said.

And earlier in October, a Chinese fighter jet came within five meters (16 feet) of a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance and surveillance plane over the East China Sea.

That incident was recorded by news crews aboard the Canadian aircraft and witnessed by Maj. Gen. Iain Huddleston, the commander of Canada’s 1st Air Division, who was also on the plane.

Huddleston called the intercept “unprofessional” and “very aggressive” in a report from Radio Canada, which was on the plane.

“The Canadian aircraft was subject to multiple close-proximity manoeuvres by a PLAAF aircraft that put the safety of all personnel at risk,” Canada’s Defense Ministry said in a statement.

China’s Foreign Ministry said the Canadian plane illegally entered Chinese airspace and accused the Canadian military of sending “warplanes halfway around the world to stir up trouble and make provocations at China’s doorsteps.”

In February, in an incident witnessed by a CNN crew, a Chinese fighter jet came within 500 feet of a US Navy reconnaissance plane flying at 21,500 feet about 30 miles from the Paracels.

Earlier this month, the Pentagon’s top official in charge of security in the Indo-Pacific, Ely Ratner, said that the US has seen more instances of “coercive and risky” behavior from Chinese pilots against US aircraft in the last two years over the East and South China Seas than in the entire decade before that.

“Since the fall of 2021, we have seen more than 180 such incidents,” Ratner said. “It’s a centralized and concerted campaign to perform these risky behaviors in order to coerce a change in lawful US operational activity.”","['waters', 'helicopter', 'close', 'sea', 'flares', 'submarinehunting', 'chinese', 'international', 'aircraft', 'fired', 'china', 'south', 'navy', 'jet', 'canadian', 'exclusive']","The first incident was over international waters outside of 34 miles from the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the South China Sea.

Resolución de Disputas

Nos esforzamos por resolver las inquietudes de los clientes tan rápido como sea posible. Por favor contacte a CNN en cnn.com/feedback.

En el improbable caso de que usted no esté satisfecho con la solución del servicio de atención al cliente, y que usted y CNN no puedan resolver una disputa a través de los Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas descriptos a continuación, usted y CNN aceptan resolver la disputa a través de un arbitraje vinculante o en una corte de reclamos menores en lugar de las cortes de jurisdicción general.

El arbitraje es una instancia más informal que un juicio en una corte. El arbitraje recurre a un árbitro imparcial en lugar de un juez o jurado, permite un periodo de instrucción más breve que en una corte y está sujeto a una revisión muy limitada por parte de las cortes. A menos que esté expresamente limitado por esta cláusula de arbitraje, los árbitros pueden otorgar los mismos daños y reparación que puede otorgar una corte. Cualquier arbitraje en virtud de este Acuerdo se llevará a cabo de forma individual; no se permiten los arbitrajes colectivos ni las demandas colectivas. En el arbitraje, usted puede tener derecho a recuperar de CNN los honorarios de sus abogados en la misma medida en que usted tendría derecho a hacerlo en una corte.

CLÁUSULA DE ARBITRAJE

(1) Reclamos sujetos a arbitraje: En la máxima medida permitida por la ley aplicable, CNN y usted aceptan arbitrar todas las disputas y reclamos que surjan entre nosotros, excepto los reclamos que surjan de lesiones corporales o que se relacionen con el cumplimiento, la protección o la validez de sus derechos de propiedad intelectual o de los nuestros (o los derechos de propiedad intelectual de cualquiera de nuestros licenciantes, afiliados y socios). Esta Cláusula de Arbitraje debe ser interpretada en sentido amplio. La cláusula incluye, pero no se limita a:

reclamos que surjan de o se relacionen con cualquier aspecto de la relación entre nosotros, ya sea que se basen en disposiciones contractuales, actos ilícitos civiles, fraude, tergiversación o cualquier otra figura legal estatutaria o de derecho consuetudinario;

reclamos que surgieron antes de este o cualquier otro Acuerdo anterior (incluido, entre otros, reclamos relacionados con publicidad);

reclamos por angustia mental o emocional, o lesiones que no surjan de una lesión corporal;

reclamos que actualmente son objeto de un pretendido litigio colectivo en el que usted no es miembro de una clase certificada; y

reclamos que puedan surgir después de la rescisión de este Acuerdo.

Las referencias a ""CNN"", ""usted"", ""nosotros"" y ""nuestro"" en esta Cláusula de Arbitraje incluyen a nuestros respectivos predecesores en intereses, sucesores y cesionarios, así como a nuestras respectivas empresas matrices, subsidiarias y afiliadas, pasadas, presentes y futuras (incluidos Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. y sus afiliadas); esas entidades y nuestros respectivos agentes, empleados, licenciatarios, licenciantes y proveedores de contenido en el momento en que surja su reclamo o el nuestro; y todos los usuarios o beneficiarios autorizados o no autorizados de Servicios en virtud de este o anteriores Acuerdos entre nosotros. Sin perjuicio de lo anterior, cualquiera de las partes puede optar por que los reclamos se resuelvan en una corte de reclamos menores solicitando solo una reparación individual, siempre que la acción no sea trasladada o apelada a una corte de jurisdicción general. Esta Cláusula de Arbitraje no le impide a usted presentar cuestiones a las agencias federales, estatales o locales. Usted acepta que, al celebrar el presente Acuerdo, tanto usted como nosotros renunciamos al derecho a participar en una demanda colectiva y a un juicio por jurado en la máxima medida permitida por la ley aplicable. Este Acuerdo evidencia una transacción en el comercio interestatal y, por lo tanto, la Ley Federal de Arbitraje (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) rige la interpretación y el cumplimiento de esta cláusula de arbitraje. Esta Cláusula de Arbitraje sobrevivirá la rescisión de este Acuerdo.

(2) Notificación Obligatoria Previa al Arbitraje y Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas: Usted y nosotros acordamos que los esfuerzos informales y de buena fe para resolver disputas a menudo pueden resultar en un resultado rápido, económico y mutuamente beneficioso. Por lo tanto, la parte que tenga la intención de iniciar un arbitraje o presentar un reclamo en una corte de reclamos menores primero debe enviar por escrito a la otra parte una Notificación de Disputa (""Notificación""). Una Notificación de usted a CNN debe ser enviada por correo electrónico a notice@wbd.com (“Dirección de Notificación”). Cualquier Notificación debe incluir (i) el nombre del reclamante, su dirección y dirección de correo electrónico; (ii) una descripción de la naturaleza y los fundamentos del reclamo o disputa; (iii) si usted presenta la Notificación, cualquier hecho relevante con respecto a su uso de los Sitios, incluido si ha creado una cuenta o si recibe boletines asociados con cualquiera de los Sitios; (iv) una descripción de la naturaleza y fundamento de la reparación específica solicitada, incluidos los daños reclamados, si los hubiere, y un cálculo detallado de éstos; y (v) una declaración firmada personalmente por el reclamante (no por su abogado) que verifique la exactitud del contenido de la Notificación. La Notificación debe ser individualizada, lo que significa que solo puede referirse a su disputa y no a la disputa de otra persona.

Después de recibir una Notificación completa, las partes deberán realizar un esfuerzo de buena fe para resolver la disputa por un período de 60 días (que puede extenderse por acuerdo). Usted y nosotros acordamos que, después de recibir la Notificación completa, el destinatario puede solicitar una conferencia de conciliación telefónica o por video (que se puede realizar después del período de 60 días) y ambas partes asistirán personalmente (con un abogado, si están representadas). Usted y nosotros acordamos que las partes (y los abogados, si están representadas) deberán trabajar cooperativamente para programar la conferencia lo antes posible en cuanto sea conveniente para ambas partes y tratar de llegar a una resolución. Si usted y nosotros no llegamos a un acuerdo para resolver las cuestiones identificadas en la Notificación dentro de los 60 días posteriores a la recepción de la Notificación completa (o en un plazo mayor si las partes así lo acuerdan), usted o nosotros podremos iniciar un procedimiento de arbitraje o un proceso judicial de reclamos menores (si lo permiten las reglas de la corte de reclamos menores).

El cumplimiento de esta sección de Notificación Obligatoria Previa al Arbitraje y Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas es una condición previa para iniciar el arbitraje. Cualquier período de prescripción aplicable (incluidos los periodos de prescripción conforme a la ley) y los plazos para pagar las tarifas de presentación se interrumpirán mientras las partes participan en los procedimientos informales de resolución de disputas establecidos en la Subsección 12.2. Tanto la Notificación Obligatoria Previa al Arbitraje como los Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas son esenciales para que usted y CNN tengan una oportunidad significativa de resolver disputas de manera informal. Si algún aspecto de estos requisitos no se ha cumplido, una corte competente puede prohibir la presentación o continuación de un arbitraje. Asimismo, a menos que lo prohíba la ley, el administrador del arbitraje no puede aceptar, administrar, evaluar o exigir tarifas en relación con un arbitraje que fue iniciado sin haber completado la Notificación y los Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas. Si el arbitraje ya se encuentra pendiente, se procederá a su cierre administrativo. Nada en este párrafo limita el derecho de una parte a reclamar en el arbitraje daños y perjuicios por incumplimiento de estos Procedimientos.

(3) Procedimiento de Arbitraje: El arbitraje se regirá por las reglas aplicables de Arbitraje y Mediación Nacional (“NAM”) (incluidas las Reglas y Procedimientos Integrales de Resolución de Disputas y/o las Reglas Complementarias para Presentaciones de Arbitraje Masivo , según corresponda) (""Reglas NAM""), modificadas por esta Cláusula de Arbitraje, y será administrado por NAM. (Si NAM no está disponible o no está dispuesto a hacerlo, otro proveedor de arbitrajes será seleccionado por las partes, o si las partes no pueden ponerse de acuerdo sobre un administrador alternativo, por la corte de conformidad con 9 U.S.C. § 5). Las Reglas NAM están disponibles en línea en http://www.NAMADR.org, llamando a NAM al 1-800-358-2550, o solicitándolas por escrito a la Dirección de Notificación (disponibles en inglés únicamente). Puede obtener un formulario para iniciar el arbitraje en: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf (disponibles en inglés únicamente) o comunicándose con NAM.

Usted y nosotros acordamos que la parte que inicia el arbitraje debe presentar una certificación de que ha cumplido y completado los requisitos de Notificación y Resolución Informal de Disputas a los que se hace referencia en la sección 12.2 y que son parte de la Cláusula de Arbitraje incluida o adjunta a la solicitud de arbitraje. La solicitud de arbitraje y certificación debe estar firmada personalmente por la parte que inicia el arbitraje (y su abogado, si está representada).

Todas las cuestiones serán decididas por el árbitro, excepto que se indique expresamente lo contrario aquí y exceptuando las cuestiones relacionadas con el alcance y la exigibilidad de la Cláusula de Arbitraje o si una disputa puede o debe someterse a arbitraje (incluyendo si una disputa está sujeta a esta Cláusula de Arbitraje o a una cláusula de arbitraje previa entre usted y CNN), las cuales serán decididas por una corte competente. El árbitro puede considerar, pero no estará obligado por las decisiones de otros arbitrajes que involucren a diferentes clientes.

A menos que usted y nosotros acordemos lo contrario, o las Reglas NAM aplicables expresen lo contrario, las audiencias de arbitraje se llevarán a cabo en el condado (o parroquia) de su dirección de facturación y usted y un representante de CNN deberán asistir en persona. Al concluir el procedimiento de arbitraje, el árbitro emitirá una decisión por escrito razonada que sea suficiente para explicar los hallazgos y conclusiones esenciales en los que se basa el laudo. La decisión del árbitro es vinculante solo entre usted y CNN, y no tendrá ningún efecto preclusivo en otro arbitraje o procedimiento que involucre a una parte diferente. El laudo de un árbitro que se haya cumplido por completo no se presentará en ninguna corte.

Al igual que ante una corte, usted y CNN acuerdan que cualquier abogado que represente a una parte en el arbitraje certifique al momento de comenzar y proceder un arbitraje que está cumpliendo con los requisitos de la Norma Federal de Procedimiento Civil 11(b), incluida la certificación de que el reclamo o la reparación que se busca no es frívola ni presentada para un propósito inapropiado. El árbitro está autorizado a imponer cualquier sanción bajo las Reglas NAM, la Regla Federal de Procedimiento Civil 11 o la ley federal o estatal aplicable, contra todas las partes representadas y los abogados correspondientes.

Salvo que se disponga expresamente en la Cláusula de Arbitraje, el árbitro puede otorgar cualquier remedio, compensación o resultado que las partes podrían haber recibido en una corte, incluida la compensación por honorarios y costos de abogados, de conformidad con la ley aplicable. A menos que la ley aplicable disponga lo contrario, serán de cargo de las partes los honorarios y costos de sus propios abogados en el arbitraje, a menos que el árbitro dicte sanciones o determine que el fondo de la demanda, la defensa o la reparación solicitada son frívolos o presentados para un propósito inapropiado (medido conforme a los estándares establecidos en la Regla Federal de Procedimiento Civil 11(b)).

(4) Tarifas del Arbitraje: El pago de las tarifas del arbitraje (las tarifas impuestas por el administrador del arbitraje, incluyendo las tarifas de presentación, árbitro y audiencia) se regirá por las Reglas NAM aplicables, a menos que usted califique para una exención de las tarifas según la ley aplicable. Si después de agotar cualquier exención de tarifas potencialmente disponible, el árbitro determina que las tarifas de arbitraje serán prohibitivas para usted en comparación con un litigio judicial, pagaremos el monto de sus tarifas de presentación, arbitraje y audiencia en el arbitraje que el árbitro considere necesario para evitar que el arbitraje tenga un costo prohibitivo, independientemente del resultado del arbitraje, a menos que el árbitro determine que su(s) reclamo(s) fue(ron) frívolo(s) o presentado(s) para un propósito inapropiado o presentados de mala fe. Usted y nosotros acordamos que el arbitraje debe ser económicamente eficiente para todas las partes y que cualquiera de las partes puede recurrir a NAM para abordar la reducción o el aplazamiento de las tarifas.

(5) Confidencialidad: A solicitud de cualquiera de las partes, el árbitro emitirá una orden exigiendo que la información confidencial de cualquiera de las partes divulgada durante el arbitraje (ya sea en documentos u oralmente) no se use ni divulgue excepto en relación con el arbitraje o con un procedimiento para hacer cumplir el laudo arbitral y que cualquier presentación judicial permitida que contenga información confidencial debe hacerse en sobre sellado en la máxima medida permitida por la ley aplicable.

(6) Oferta de Transacción: En cualquier arbitraje entre usted y CNN, la parte demandada puede, pero no está obligada, a hacer una oferta de transacción por escrito en cualquier momento antes de la audiencia probatoria o, si se permite una excepción preliminar, antes de que se acoja la excepción preliminar. El monto o los términos de cualquier oferta de transacción no se pueden divulgar al árbitro hasta después de que el árbitro emita un laudo sobre el reclamo. Si el laudo se emite a favor de la otra parte y es menor que la oferta de transacción de la parte demandada o si el laudo es a favor de la parte demandada, la otra parte debe pagar los costos incurridos por la parte demandada después de que se hizo la oferta, incluidos los honorarios de los abogados. Si alguna ley o jurisprudencia aplicable prohíbe el traslado de los costos incurridos en el arbitraje, entonces la oferta en esta disposición servirá para cesar la acumulación de los costos a los que la parte que presenta la demanda pueda tener derecho por el fundamento de la acción en virtud de la cual está demandando.

(7) Requisito de Reparación Individual: el árbitro puede otorgar una reparación declaratoria o cautelar solo a favor de la parte individual que busca la reparación y solo en la medida necesaria para proporcionar la reparación justificada por el reclamo individual de esa parte. EN LA MEDIDA MÁXIMA QUE LO PERMITA LA LEY APLICABLE, USTED Y NOSOTROS ACORDAMOS QUE CADA UNO PUEDE PRESENTAR RECLAMACIONES EN CONTRA DEL OTRO ÚNICAMENTE EN CARACTER INDIVIDUAL, Y NO COMO DEMANDANTE O MIEMBRO DE UNA CLASE EN UN PRETENDIDO PROCEDIMIENTO COLECTIVO, REPRESENTATIVO, O DE PROCURADOR GENERAL PRIVADO. Asimismo, a menos que tanto usted como nosotros acordemos lo contrario, el árbitro no puede consolidar las reclamaciones de más de una persona y no puede presidir ninguna forma de procedimiento representativo, colectivo o de procurador general privado. Si, después del agotamiento de todos los recursos, alguna de estas prohibiciones relativas a medidas cautelares o declaratorias no individualizadas; reclamos colectivos, representativos y de procurador general privado; y consolidación, se resuelve que no es ejecutable con respecto a un reclamo en particular o con respecto a una solicitud de reparación en particular (como una solicitud de medida cautelar solicitada con respecto a un reclamo en particular), entonces las partes acuerdan que tal reclamo o solicitud de reparación será decidido por una corte competente, después de que se hayan arbitrado todas las demás reclamaciones arbitrables y solicitudes de reparación. Usted acepta que cualquier arbitraje entre usted y CNN estará sujeto a esta Sección 12 y no a acuerdo(s) de arbitraje previo(s) que haya tenido con CNN y, sin perjuicio de cualquier disposición en contrario en este Acuerdo, usted acepta que esta Sección 12 modifica cualquier acuerdo de arbitraje previo que tuvo con CNN, incluso con respecto a reclamos que surgieron antes de este o cualquier acuerdo de arbitraje anterior.

(8) Exclusión de Cambios Futuros: Sin perjuicio de cualquier disposición en contrario, si CNN realiza algún cambio en el futuro a esta Cláusula de Arbitraje (que no sea un cambio en la Dirección de Notificación), usted puede rechazar dicho cambio enviando un correo electrónico a CNN a notice@wbd.com dentro de los 30 días posteriores a la publicación de la cláusula de arbitraje modificada, que proporcione: (i) su nombre legal completo, (ii) su dirección postal completa, (iii) su número de teléfono, (iv) si corresponde, el nombre de usuario o la dirección de correo electrónico asociados con cualquier potencial cuenta o boletín; y (v) la fecha aproximada de su uso inicial del Sitio relevante. Dicho correo electrónico de exclusión debe ser enviado por usted personalmente, y no por su agente, abogado o cualquier otra persona que pretenda actuar en su nombre. Debe incluir una declaración, firmada personalmente por usted, de que desea rechazar el cambio a la Cláusula de Arbitraje. Esta no es una exclusión del arbitraje en su totalidad.

(9) Presentación Masiva:

Si, en cualquier momento, 25 o más demandantes (incluido usted) presentan Notificaciones o pretenden presentar solicitudes de arbitraje planteando reclamos similares contra la otra parte o partes relacionadas, por abogado(s) o entidad(es) iguales o coordinadas, de conformidad con la definición y los criterios de Presentaciones Masivas (""Presentación Masiva"") establecidos en las Reglas y Procedimientos Complementarios de Resolución de Disputas de Presentación Masiva de NAM (""Reglas de Presentación Masiva de NAM"", disponibles en https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/ (disponible en inglés únicamente)), usted y nosotros acordamos que se aplicarán los procedimientos adicionales establecidos a continuación. Las partes acuerdan que a lo largo de este proceso, sus abogados deberán reunirse y consultarse para discutir modificaciones a estos procedimientos en función de las necesidades particulares de la Presentación Masiva. Las partes reconocen y aceptan que al optar por participar en una Presentación Masiva, la resolución de su disputa podría retrasarse. Cualquier período de prescripción aplicable (incluido la prescripción conforme a la ley) y los plazos de las tarifas de presentación se suspenderán a partir del momento en que se inicie la Notificación Obligatoria Previa al Arbitraje y Procedimientos Informales de Resolución de Disputas, siempre y cuando la Notificación previa al arbitraje cumpla con los requisitos de la Sección 12.2, y hasta que su reclamo sea seleccionado para continuar como parte de un proceso por etapas o se resuelva por acuerdo, se retire, sea resuelto de otro modo o se excluya del arbitraje.

Etapa Uno: Los abogados de los demandantes y los abogados de CNN seleccionarán cada uno 25 reclamos por lado (50 reclamos en total) para presentar y proceder en arbitrajes individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Cada uno de estos arbitrajes individuales se asignará a un único y diferente árbitro, a menos que las partes acuerden lo contrario por escrito. Los reclamos restantes no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados a arbitraje, ni se cobrarán las tarifas de arbitraje en relación con esos reclamos, a menos y hasta que sean seleccionados para ser presentados en procedimientos de arbitraje individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Después de que se complete este grupo inicial de procedimientos por etapas, las partes participarán prontamente en una sesión de mediación global de todos los reclamos restantes con un juez de una corte federal o estatal retirado y CNN pagará los honorarios del mediador.

Etapa Dos: Si los reclamos restantes no se resuelven en este momento, los abogados de los demandantes y los abogados de CNN seleccionarán cada uno 50 reclamos por lado (100 reclamos en total) para presentar y proceder en arbitrajes individuales como parte de un segundo proceso por etapas, sujeto a cualquier cambio procesal que las partes acuerden por escrito. Cada uno de estos arbitrajes individuales se asignará a un único y diferente árbitro, a menos que las partes acuerden lo contrario por escrito. Los reclamos restantes no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados a arbitraje, ni se cobrarán las tarifas de arbitraje en relación con esos reclamos, a menos y hasta que se seleccionen para ser presentados en procedimientos de arbitraje individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Después de que se complete este segundo conjunto de procedimientos por etapas, las partes participarán de inmediato en una sesión de mediación global de todos los reclamos restantes con un juez de una corte federal o estatal retirado y CNN pagará los honorarios del mediador.

Etapa Tres: Si los reclamos restantes no se resuelven en este momento, los abogados de los demandantes y los abogados de CNN seleccionarán cada uno 100 reclamos por parte (200 reclamos en total) para presentar y proceder en arbitrajes individuales como parte de un tercer proceso por etapas, sujeto a cualquier cambio procesal que las partes acuerden por escrito. Los reclamos restantes no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados a arbitraje, ni se cobrarán las tarifas de arbitraje en relación con esos reclamos, a menos y hasta que se seleccionen para ser presentados en procedimientos de arbitraje individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Después de este tercer conjunto de procedimientos por etapas, los abogados de los demandantes pueden elegir que las partes participen en una sesión de mediación global de todos los reclamos restantes con un juez de una corte federal o estatal retirado.

Si su reclamo no se resuelve como parte del proceso por etapas identificado anteriormente:

Opción Uno: Usted y CNN pueden por separado o por acuerdo, optar por la exclusión del arbitraje y elegir que su reclamo se presente en una corte de conformidad con el Acuerdo. Usted puede optar por la exclusión del arbitraje proporcionando una notificación, individual y firmada personalmente por usted, de su intención de optar por la exclusión del arbitraje, enviando un correo electrónico a CNN a notice@wbd.com. Dicho correo electrónico de exclusión debe ser enviado por usted personalmente, y no por su agente, abogado o cualquier otra persona que pretenda actuar en su nombre. Debe incluir una declaración firmada personalmente por usted de que desea optar por la exclusión del arbitraje dentro de los 30 días posteriores a la conclusión de la Etapa 3 o de la mediación electiva asociada con la Etapa 3. CNN puede excluir su reclamo de arbitraje enviando a su abogado una notificación individual, personalmente firmada, de su intención de excluirlo, dentro de los 14 días posteriores a la expiración de su período de 30 días para optar por la exclusión. Los abogados de las partes pueden acordar ajustar estos plazos.

O

Opción Dos: Si ni usted ni CNN eligen que su reclamo se escuche en una corte de acuerdo con la Opción Uno, entonces usted acepta que su reclamo se resolverá como parte de un procedimiento de arbitraje individual continuo y por etapas como se establece a continuación. Suponiendo que el número de reclamaciones restantes supere las 200, se seleccionarán al azar 200 reclamaciones (o se seleccionarán a través de un proceso acordado por los abogados de las partes) para presentarlas y proceder en arbitrajes individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Si el número de reclamaciones restantes es inferior a 200, entonces todas esas reclamaciones se presentarán y procederán en arbitrajes individuales. Los reclamos restantes no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados a arbitraje, ni se cobrarán tarifas de arbitraje en relación con esos reclamos, a menos y hasta que sean seleccionados para ser presentados en procedimientos de arbitraje individuales como parte de un proceso por etapas. Después de que cada conjunto de 200 reclamaciones se resuelva, arribe a un acuerdo, se retire o se resuelva de otra forma, este proceso se repetirá de acuerdo con estos parámetros. Se alienta a los abogados de las partes a que se reúnan y consulten, participen en la mediación y se comprometan entre sí y con NAM (incluso a través de un Árbitro Procesal) para explorar formas de simplificar la resolución de reclamos, aumentar la cantidad de reclamos para proceder en cualquier momento, promover la eficiencia, conservar los recursos y resolver las reclamaciones restantes.

Una corte competente tendrá la autoridad para ejecutar estas disposiciones de Presentación Masiva y, si es necesario, prohibir la presentación masiva, continuación o administración de arbitrajes, y la valuación de las tarifas de arbitraje. Si estos procedimientos adicionales aplican a su reclamo, y una corte competente determina que no son exigibles en cuanto a su reclamo, entonces su reclamo procederá en una corte competente de conformidad con este Acuerdo.

Usted y CNN acordamos que ambos valoramos la integridad y la eficiencia del arbitraje y deseamos emplear el proceso para la resolución justa de disputas genuinas y sinceras entre nosotros. Usted y CNN reconocen y aceptan actuar de buena fe para garantizar que se sigan los procesos establecidos en este documento. Las partes también acuerdan que la aplicación de estos procedimientos de Presentación Masiva ha sido razonablemente diseñada para dar como resultado una resolución eficiente y justa de tales casos.

(10) Separabilidad: Si se determina que alguna parte de esta Cláusula de Arbitraje es declarada nula, inválida o inejecutable de algún modo, dicha parte se considerará divisible y, si es posible, reemplazada por una disposición o parte válida y ejecutable, que coincida en lo más posible con la intención de la disposición original, o parte de ella. El resto de esta Cláusula de Arbitraje seguirá siendo ejecutable y válida de acuerdo con los términos contenidos en este documento.

RENUNCIA A DEMANDA COLECTIVA Y JUICIO CON JURADO:

Usted y CNN acuerdan que, en la máxima medida permitida por la ley, cada parte puede presentar reclamos (ya sea en una corte o en arbitraje) contra la otra solo a título individual y no participar como demandante, reclamante o miembro de la clase en cualquier procedimiento de clase, colectivo, consolidado, de procurador general privado o representativo. Esto significa que usted y CNN no pueden presentar un reclamo en nombre de una clase o grupo y no pueden presentar un reclamo en nombre de ninguna otra persona a menos que lo hagan como padre, tutor o guardián de un menor o en otra capacidad similar por un individuo que de otro modo no puede presentar su propio reclamo individual. Esto también significa que usted y CNN no pueden participar en ningún procedimiento de clase, colectivo, consolidado, de procurador general privado o representativo presentado por un tercero. Sin perjuicio de lo anterior, usted o CNN pueden participar en un acuerdo transaccional colectivo.

En la máxima medida permitida por la ley, usted y CNN renuncian a cualquier derecho a un juicio con jurado.

542,Las relaciones entre Israel y la ONU alcanzan un mínimo histórico luego de que Guterres invocara una medida diplomática poco habitual,"Guterres: Gaza se está convirtiendo en cementerio de niños 1:51

(CNN) -- Las relaciones de Israel con las Naciones Unidas alcanzaron un mínimo histórico tras la escalada de tensión entre ambos organismos esta semana.



El secretario general de la ONU, António Guterres, invocó este miércoles una herramienta poco utilizada pero poderosa en su decidida apuesta por un alto el fuego en Gaza, suscitando la indignación de los diplomáticos israelíes.

El Artículo 99 de la Carta de la ONU permite al jefe de la ONU llamar la atención del Consejo de Seguridad sobre ""cualquier cuestión que pueda agravar las amenazas existentes para el mantenimiento de la paz y la seguridad internacionales"". Guterres, en una carta al Consejo de 15 miembros, utilizó esa herramienta diplomática e instó al organismo a ""presionar para evitar una catástrofe humanitaria"" y unirse en un llamamiento a un alto el fuego humanitario total.

Israel se ha opuesto firmemente a los llamamientos a un alto el fuego, argumentando que necesita seguir adelante con su ofensiva en Gaza para eliminar a Hamas después de que sus combatientes atacaran el país el 7 de octubre, matando a 1.200 personas y tomando más de 240 rehenes. La campaña israelí en Gaza ha causado la muerte de más de 16.000 personas, según el Ministerio de Sanidad palestino, con sede en Ramala, que elabora sus informes con datos de fuentes médicas de la Gaza gobernada por Hamas.

El ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Israel, Eli Cohen, arremetió contra el secretario general por su carta, afirmando que el mandato del jefe de la ONU era ""un peligro para la paz mundial"" y que su llamamiento a un alto el fuego en Gaza equivalía a apoyar a Hamas y el ataque del 7 de octubre.

La carta de Guterres representa la séptima vez en los 78 años de historia de la ONU en la que se invocaba el Artículo 99, y la primera vez que se utilizaba desde 1989, cuando el entonces secretario general Javier Pérez de Cuéllar instó al Consejo de Seguridad a pedir un alto el fuego durante la guerra civil libanesa, según Daniel Forti, analista principal de la ONU en el International Crisis Group, un grupo de reflexión con sede en Bruselas.

Fue un ""puñetazo simbólico"", dijo Forti a CNN sobre la medida de Guterres. ""Una petición urgente de acción diplomática para evitar que la catástrofe humanitaria en Gaza cruce un punto de no retorno"".

""Estamos en un punto de ruptura"", declaró Guterres en la reunión del Consejo del viernes. ""Existe un alto riesgo de colapso del sistema de apoyo humanitario en Gaza, lo que tendría consecuencias devastadoras"".

Forti dijo que era poco probable que la carta de Guterres cambiara la dinámica política dentro del Consejo de Seguridad, pero que podría crear más urgencia para la acción diplomática. ""Dado que esta herramienta se utiliza tan raramente, tiene un impacto moral"", afirmó.

El embajador israelí ante las Naciones Unidas, Gilad Erdan, ha argumentado que un alto el fuego ""consolida el control de Hamas sobre Gaza"" y prolonga ""el sufrimiento de todos"".

También criticó a Guterres por el raro uso del Artículo 99, señalando que las recientes guerras en Ucrania, Yemen y Siria no habían desencadenado la misma respuesta. ""A pesar del inmenso impacto global de otros conflictos y de amenazas mucho más apremiantes para la paz y la seguridad internacionales, la guerra defensiva de Israel contra Hamas, una organización designada terrorista, fue el catalizador para activar el Artículo 99"".

Guterres ya se había enfrentado a intensas críticas por parte de Israel, que desde hace tiempo considera que la ONU es parcial en su contra, y múltiples funcionarios israelíes han pedido públicamente su dimisión. El jefe de la ONU ha condenado repetidamente el ataque de Hamas del 7 de octubre, incluso en la carta en la que invocó el Artículo 99.

Estados Unidos veta una resolución de alto el fuego

Más tarde, Estados Unidos vetó el viernes una resolución que pedía un alto el fuego inmediato en Gaza, devastada por la guerra, en medio de la creciente preocupación por el número de víctimas civiles. La resolución, que hacía referencia al uso del Artículo 99 por parte de Guterres, fue redactada por Emiratos Árabes Unidos y copatrocinada por al menos otros 97 países.

Una mayoría de trece de los quince miembros del Consejo de Seguridad votó a favor de la breve resolución, con la abstención del Reino Unido y el ejercicio del derecho de veto por parte de Estados Unidos.

Una versión preliminar de la resolución, presentada por Emiratos Árabes Unidos y vista por CNN, había pedido ""un alto el fuego humanitario inmediato"", así como ""la liberación inmediata e incondicional de todos los rehenes"" y ""garantizar el acceso humanitario"".

Sin embargo, tras la votación, el embajador adjunto de Estados Unidos, Robert Wood, criticó la resolución por no mencionar, entre otras cosas, los ataques terroristas perpetrados por Hamas el 7 de octubre.

Estados Unidos, uno de los cinco miembros permanentes del Consejo con derecho de veto, se ha resistido repetidamente a los llamamientos al ""alto el fuego"", insistiendo en el derecho de Israel a defenderse. La votación del viernes fue el sexto intento del Consejo de alcanzar un consenso sobre la guerra en curso entre Israel y Hamas. Sólo prosperó una votación anterior, en la que se pidió el mes pasado que se establecieran ""pausas y corredores humanitarios"" en Gaza.

El Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU no ha logrado ponerse de acuerdo sobre cómo responder a los atentados de Hamas y a la posterior guerra de Israel contra el grupo radical palestino, con enfrentamientos entre bandos rivales dentro del organismo, en particular Estados Unidos y Rusia. El 15 de noviembre se aprobó una resolución en la que se pedía la liberación inmediata de todos los rehenes de Hamas, así como la adopción de pausas humanitarias urgentes y prolongadas. Israel ha censurado que el Consejo no condenara el atentado del 7 de octubre.

Relaciones en un mínimo histórico

Gabriela Shalev, que fue embajadora de Israel ante la ONU de 2008 a 2010, afirmó que las relaciones entre Israel y la ONU se encuentran ahora en un mínimo histórico, y recordó que los lazos se tensaron poco después de la creación de Israel tras una resolución de la Asamblea General de la ONU en 1947.

""Creo que es un punto muy bajo en las relaciones entre Israel y la ONU... un punto muy bajo en nuestras relaciones con el mundo"", a excepción de Estados Unidos, dijo a CNN Shalev, que también es profesora emérita de la Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad Hebrea. ""Tenemos la sensación de que las organizaciones de la ONU de todo el mundo no entienden que Israel está ahora en guerra por su existencia como Estado judío y democrático, (se enfrenta) a una amenaza existencial desde todos los lados"".

Los diplomáticos israelíes han utilizado sus plataformas en la ONU para denunciar al organismo mundial desde que comenzó la guerra. Gilad Erdan, embajador israelí ante la ONU, y su personal han portado estrellas de David amarillas para protestar por la supuesta inacción de la ONU ante el ataque de Hamas, evocando recuerdos de la persecución de judíos en la época nazi.

Él y Cohen, el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores, han estado en el centro de los intentos de Israel de desacreditar a la ONU y a su jefe.

El 24 de octubre, Guterres pronunció un discurso ante el Consejo de Seguridad en el que condenó ""inequívocamente"" el ataque de Hamas, pero dijo que no se había producido ""en el vacío"" y que los palestinos habían estado ""sometidos a 56 años de ocupación asfixiante"" por parte de Israel.

Esto causó furia entre los diplomáticos israelíes. En respuesta, Erdan pidió al secretario general que dimitiera y dijo que su país bloquearía los visados a los funcionarios de la ONU para ""darles una lección"". Señaló que los funcionarios de Hamas estaban citando su discurso como justificación para su ataque, y acusó a la ONU de antisemitismo, pidiendo que se detuviera su financiación.

Desde entonces, Cohen se ha negado a reunirse con Guterres, afirmando que ""no hay lugar para un enfoque equilibrado"" del atentado del 7 de octubre, y le ha pedido reiteradamente que dimita.

Shalev, exembajadora de Israel, dijo que la forma en que los diplomáticos israelíes han estado abordando el conflicto con la ONU ""no es la correcta"", en particular los llamamientos a la dimisión del secretario general. Hacer caso omiso de las opiniones de la ONU o abandonar la organización no ayudaría a Israel, añadió.

""El secretario general es nombrado por la Asamblea General y el único órgano que puede despedirle u obligarle a retirarse es la Asamblea General"", afirmó.

La disputa va más allá del secretario general

La disputa de Israel con la ONU va más allá del secretario general. Las autoridades israelíes también han criticado a la Organización Mundial de la Salud, a ONU Mujeres y a la relatora especial de la ONU para los Territorios Palestinos Ocupados, Francesca Albanese.

Mientras tanto, más de 100 miembros del personal de la ONU han muerto en Gaza desde que comenzó el conflicto, la mayor pérdida en la historia del organismo mundial. UNRWA emplea a más de 10.000 personas en Gaza. Las oficinas de la ONU en todo el mundo guardaron un minuto de silencio e izaron sus banderas a media asta el mes pasado para rendirles homenaje. La Agencia de las Naciones Unidas para los Refugiados Palestinos (UNRWA) declaró el mes pasado que había registrado daños colaterales y directos en más de 60 de sus instalaciones, la mayoría de las cuales eran escuelas que albergaban a miles de civiles.

La UNRWA ha sido uno de los principales blancos de las críticas israelíes. La organización fue fundada por la ONU un año después de la guerra árabe-israelí de 1948, para proporcionar ayuda a los palestinos desplazados. Define a los refugiados palestinos como aquellos que fueron desposeídos de sus hogares durante la creación de Israel en 1948, así como sus descendientes, lo que les da derecho a regresar a sus hogares ancestrales en lo que hoy es Israel. Las personas que encajan en esa definición son ahora 5,9 millones. Israel ha rechazado la idea de que puedan regresar, argumentando que ello anularía su carácter judío.

Israel lleva mucho tiempo acusando a la UNRWA de incitación antiisraelí, algo que la agencia ha negado en repetidas ocasiones, y en 2017, el primer ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, trató de desmantelar el organismo de la ONU, diciendo que debería fusionarse con la principal agencia de la ONU para los refugiados.

Desde el ataque del 7 de octubre, los periodistas y medios de comunicación israelíes han vuelto a centrar su atención en la UNRWA y han amplificado las historias que cuestionan su papel en la guerra.

El mes pasado, un periodista israelí afirmó en la plataforma de medios sociales X, antes Twitter, que uno de los secuestradores de Gaza era un profesor de una escuela gestionada por la UNRWA. Ese informe fue recogido por los medios de comunicación israelíes, lo que llevó a la agencia de la ONU a emitir un comunicado pidiendo el ""cese inmediato"" de la difusión de ""afirmaciones sin fundamento"" sobre la organización, diciendo que equivalían a ""desinformación"".

Otra noticia ampliamente retomada por los medios de comunicación israelíes afirmaba que el ejército israelí había encontrado armas en Gaza almacenadas debajo de las cajas de la UNRWA, sugiriendo que la agencia de la ONU podría ser cómplice de la militancia de Hamas. Erdan, embajador de Israel ante la ONU, dijo que el video demostraba que la ONU se había convertido en ""cómplice del terror"".

Albanese ha sido objeto de una feroz campaña de críticas israelíes. Recientemente, un portavoz del gobierno israelí acusó al funcionario de ser ""un desvergonzado funcionario cómplice de Hamas"" que ejerce una ""repugnante inversión del Holocausto"".

Al día siguiente, Albanese escribió que cualquiera que trabaje sobre Israel o los territorios palestinos es acusado de ""apoyar el terror"" o ""ser antisemita"".

""Los ataques más vergonzosos dirigidos a la ONU son los que se dirigen contra la UNRWA, que representa a la ONU en momentos críticos de guerra, incluso con apoyo vital"", añadió Albanese.

Artículos en los medios de comunicación israelíes también han cuestionado la credibilidad de UNRWA y han pedido un ""replanteamiento"" de la organización.

Shalev dijo que había poca confianza israelí en UNRWA.

""¿Adónde va la ayuda humanitaria que llega a Gaza? ¿Va a la población o a Hamas?"".

La UNRWA ha negado repetidamente las acusaciones de que su ayuda está siendo desviada y de que enseña el odio en sus escuelas, y ha cuestionado ""la motivación de quienes hacen tales afirmaciones, a través de grandes campañas de promoción"". Ha condenado el atentado de Hamas como ""aborrecible"".

A pesar de la antigua desconfianza, Shalev dijo que la retórica contra la ONU no era la mejor forma de responder para los israelíes.

""Tenemos que mostrar al mundo... lo que realmente ocurrió el 7 de octubre"", dijo, añadiendo que Israel no tiene que ""actuar emocionalmente"" o ""hacer todas estas declaraciones vacías"" para perseguir ese objetivo.","['que', 'relaciones', 'y', 'medida', 'poco', 'israel', 'las', 'luego', 'el', 'la', 'mínimo', 'una', 'en', 'del', 'los', 'por', 'onu']","El jefe de la ONU ha condenado repetidamente el ataque de Hamas del 7 de octubre, incluso en la carta en la que invocó el Artículo 99.

544,Encuentran bebés muertos y en descomposición en la unidad de cuidados intensivos de un hospital evacuado en Gaza,"Médicos en Gaza obligados a sacar bebés prematuros de las incubadoras 4:14

Nota del editor: el siguiente reportaje incluye contenido explícito. Se recomienda la discreción del público.

(CNN) -- La escena en la unidad de cuidados intensivos del hospital Al-Nasr es escalofriante. Los diminutos cuerpos de bebés, varios de ellos aún conectados a los cables y tubos que debían mantenerlos con vida, se descomponen en sus camas de hospital. Junto a ellos, sobre las sábanas, todavía hay biberones de leche y pañales de repuesto.



El video del interior del hospital fue grabado el 27 de noviembre por Mohamed Baalousha, reportero en Gaza del medio de comunicación emiratí Al Mashhad. Baalousha compartió con CNN una versión sin difuminar en la que se ven los restos de al menos cuatro bebés.

Tres de ellos parecen seguir conectados a las máquinas del hospital. Los cuerpos de los bebés parecen haberse oscurecido y estar desintegrándose por la putrefacción, y en algunas de las camas quedan poco más que esqueletos. En la piel de un menor se distinguen claramente moscas y gusanos caminando.

Las circunstancias que rodean a uno de los videos más horrendos de la guerra de Gaza siguen sin estar claras, pero tras días de reconstruir la información disponible mediante entrevistas, declaraciones publicadas y videos, se puede describir una escena caótica en la que el personal del hospital intenta proteger a sus pacientes más vulnerables, atrapados en medio de una batalla encarnizada, a la espera de una ayuda que nunca llegó.

Esto descubrió CNN:

CNN geolocalizó el video en el hospital Al-Nasr, en el norte de Gaza. Esta zona ha sido en gran medida inaccesible para los periodistas en las últimas semanas debido a la intensidad de los combates, pero durante la tregua de siete días, Baalousha dice que pudo acceder al hospital para filmar lo que quedaba allí.

Desde principios de noviembre, los hospitales pediátricos Al-Nasr y Al-Rantisi, que forman parte del mismo complejo, se habían convertido en la primera línea de los combates entre las fuerzas israelíes y Hamas.

En declaraciones públicas y entrevistas, varios miembros del personal médico y funcionarios de salud de Al-Nasr afirmaron que tuvieron que evacuar apresuradamente el hospital el 10 de noviembre, bajo la dirección de las fuerzas israelíes.

El personal médico describió haber tenido que dejar a niños pequeños en la unidad de cuidados intensivos porque no tenían medios para trasladarlos con seguridad.

Un médico asociado al hospital, que no quiso dar su nombre, dijo a CNN que dos de los niños, un bebé de dos años y otro de nueve meses, habían muerto poco antes de la evacuación, pero que tres niños habían quedado vivos aún conectados a respiradores. Uno de ellos tenía dos meses. Varios de los bebés ingresados en la UCI sufrían trastornos genéticos, según el médico.

El estado de los que quedaron vivos, tanto en el momento en que los combates llegaron al hospital como cuando se produjo la evacuación, sigue sin estar claro.

En un video del 9 de noviembre, el jefe de los hospitales pediátricos Al-Nasr y Al-Rantisi, Dr. Mustafa al-Kahlout, dijo que el hospital Al-Nasr había sido ""golpeado dos veces"" y había sufrido ""muchos daños"".

Kahlout advirtió que el oxígeno de la unidad de cuidados intensivos ""estaba cortado"" e informó que al menos un paciente había muerto a consecuencia de ello, y que otros corrían peligro de muerte.

No está claro si los cilindros de oxígeno, que se ven junto a algunas de las camas en el video del hospital, estaban funcionando o si se habían agotado los suministros.

""La situación es realmente mala, estamos rodeados... las ambulancias no pueden llegar al hospital, y las ambulancias que intentaron llegar a Al-Nasr fueron atacadas"", declaró Kahlout, que hizo un llamamiento a las organizaciones internacionales, incluido el Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja (CICR), para que intervengan y salven al personal médico y a los pacientes que permanecen en la unidad de cuidados intensivos.

Un video compartido en las redes sociales el 9 de noviembre, que CNN verificó, fue filmado desde el interior del hospital Al-Nasr y parece mostrar las secuelas del ataque al edificio.

Otro video del 10 de noviembre mostraba un tanque de las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel (FDI) fuera de Al-Nasr, lo que indica que las FDI estaban operando en la zona. Otro video de la misma fecha mostraba a civiles con banderas blancas improvisadas que intentaban huir del hospital en medio de disparos y luego se veían obligados a volver corriendo al interior. En el video no se puede distinguir quién dispara.

Las imágenes satelitales revisadas por CNN del 11 de noviembre muestran grandes cráteres alrededor del complejo hospitalario, lo que indica que la zona había sido bombardeada, dificultando la evacuación.

Sin embargo, en una grabación de audio de una conversación entre un alto funcionario del hospital Al-Rantisi y un oficial de COGAT, que coordina las actividades del gobierno israelí en los territorios palestinos y Gaza, parece que las fuerzas israelíes dieron instrucciones a los pacientes y al personal del hospital para que evacuaran la zona.

En la grabación, difundida por las FDI el 11 de noviembre, el oficial israelí asegura al funcionario del hospital que se organizarán ambulancias.

El funcionario del hospital le dice al oficial del COGAT que las ambulancias no pueden llegar al hospital, y el oficial responde: ""Organizaré la coordinación con el centro de ayuda primaria. No se preocupe, estoy cerca del ejército, todo saldrá bien"".

""¿Llevarán las ambulancias a los pacientes y al personal médico?"", pregunta el funcionario del hospital.

""No hay problema"", responde el oficial del COGAT, en la grabación.

A continuación, el funcionario del hospital confirma que el funcionario del COGAT sabe que se evacuará a la gente de los hospitales Al-Nasr y Al-Rantisi, y el funcionario del COGAT dice ""sí, sí"".

Pero los funcionarios del hospital dicen que las ambulancias nunca llegaron.

""Muchos de los pacientes fueron sacados por sus familias, las ambulancias no pudieron llegar al hospital"", declaró Kahlout en una rueda de prensa el 14 de noviembre, tras la evacuación.

Tres niños quedaron en la UCI conectados a las máquinas del hospital pero sin oxígeno, dijo Kahlout.

En una grabación de audio del 10 de noviembre difundida por Médicos Sin Fronteras (MSF), un enfermero que, según la organización, trabajaba como voluntario a título personal, dijo que el hospital había sido bombardeado, alcanzando varias plantas, depósitos de agua y estaciones de electricidad y oxígeno.

El enfermero, que CNN no identifica por motivos de seguridad, dijo que las FDI dieron 30 minutos al personal de Al-Nasr para evacuar el hospital, y añadió que ninguna ambulancia pudo llegar al hospital.

""Salimos un poco y había disparos a nuestro alrededor"", dijo en la grabación. Entonces dijo que alguien de las FDI le dijo: "" Les daré paso seguro, tienen desde las 11:30 hasta las 12:00 del mediodía"".

""Así que salimos con las manos en alto portando banderas blancas y llevando a familias y niños"", dijo el enfermero en la grabación.

Según dijo, logró sacar consigo a un bebé mientras escapaba y lo entregó a una ambulancia que se dirigía al hospital Al-Shifa. Pero, según el enfermero, cuatro niños se quedaron en la UCI, en una discrepancia con el número dado por Kahlout.

""Dejar morir a mi paciente delante de mis ojos es lo más duro que he vivido jamás, es indescriptible, nos rompieron el corazón, no pudimos ayudarlos, no pudimos llevarlos, apenas pudimos salir con nuestros hijos, somos civiles, somos un equipo médico, somos civiles desplazados"", dijo en la grabación.

A lo largo de la semana pasada, CNN ha intentado hablar con personal médico y funcionarios del hospital Al-Nasr, pero todos han dicho que tienen demasiado miedo de hablar o no se les puede localizar.

El director de los hospitales de Gaza del Ministerio de Sanidad, controlado por Hamas, el Dr. Mohammad Zaqout, dijo a CNN que la gente del hospital fue obligada a abandonar el lugar por las FDI.

""Nos vimos obligados a abandonarlos a su suerte porque no teníamos una evacuación médica segura... les informamos que esos niños estaban en camas y no podían ser evacuados. Sostuvimos a otros niños en brazos mientras nos obligaban a evacuar"", declaró Zaqout.

Las FDI han negado rotundamente su responsabilidad en la muerte de los menores de la UCI de Al-Nasr. ""Dado que las FDI no operaron dentro del hospital Al-Nasr, estas acusaciones no solo son falsas, sino también una perversa explotación de vidas inocentes, utilizadas como herramientas para difundir una peligrosa desinformación"", afirmaron las FDI en un comunicado enviado a CNN.

Tras preguntas reiteradas de CNN sobre por qué no había proporcionado ambulancias para la evacuación, como había prometido el oficial del COGAT en la conversación grabada con el funcionario del hospital, y sobre si eran conscientes de la presencia de niños abandonados en la UCI, como alegó Zaqout, las FDI no respondieron directamente.

Durante una sesión de preguntas y respuestas en línea para periodistas el sábado, el portavoz de las FDI, Doron Spielman, rechazó la historia como un mero ""rumor"".

""No hubo bebés prematuros que se descompusieran por culpa de las FDI. Probablemente no hubo bebés que se descompusieran en absoluto"", dijo Spielman. ""Pero Hamas está a cargo del hospital Nasr, no estamos ocupando el hospital Nasr"".

Israel ha acusado repetidamente a Hamas de utilizar los hospitales como centros de mando e incluso como lugares para retener rehenes.

Zaqout niega la acusación y ha pedido repetidamente que ""entidades neutrales, organizaciones de derechos humanos y medios de comunicación entren en los hospitales y verifiquen por sí mismos que se utilizan únicamente con fines civiles y humanitarios"".

CNN no puede confirmar de forma independiente en qué estado se encontraban los menores cuando los dejaron en el hospital. Pero Stefan Schmitt, forense de la Universidad Internacional de Florida, revisó el video para CNN y dijo que el nivel de descomposición de los bebés era avanzado.

Schmitt dijo que creía que la habitación no había sido alterada desde que dejaron a los niños. ""Esos restos se descompusieron in situ, lo que significa que se descompusieron allí, en esas camas"", dijo. ""Se puede ver por los fluidos corporales que se han filtrado durante el tiempo de descomposición"".

Schmitt también dijo que uno de los cadáveres parecía estar envuelto en tela, posiblemente un sudario, y señaló que no había ningún equipo médico unido al cuerpo, lo que sugiere que el cuerpo podría haber estado ya muerto o gravemente herido. La habitación parecía haber sido abandonada a toda prisa, continuó Schmitt, señalando la silla de coche para bebés y lo que parece ser una bolsa preparada para uno de los niños junto a su cama.

En un comunicado del Ministerio de Sanidad de Gaza, controlado por Hamas, emitido en respuesta al video de los restos de los bebés, se afirma que las FDI ordenaron al personal de enfermería de Al-Nasr que abandonara el lugar y les dijeron que el CICR iba a venir a evacuar a los pacientes.

""En lugar de ello, encontraron sus cuerpos descompuestos en sus camas"", dice el comunicado. ""Estos bebés exhalaron su último aliento solos y murieron solos"".

El CICR dijo a CNN que recibió ""varias peticiones"" de evacuación de hospitales del norte de Gaza, pero debido a la ""situación de seguridad"" no participó ""en ninguna operación ni evacuación, ni los equipos se comprometieron a hacerlo"". El CICR añadió que las imágenes de los niños fallecidos eran una ""tragedia indescriptible"".

546,Los viajes en avión privado al estilo Uber están aquí. Esto cuestan los vuelos,"(CNN) -- Si estás acostumbrado a reservar viajes con solo hacer clic en un botón o deslizar el dedo por una aplicación, puede sorprenderte que, entre más alto vas por la cadena de lujo, más difícil es hacerlo.

¿Siempre soñaste con volar en un avión privado? Por lo general, eso significa llamar a un agente, y si no tienes uno entre tus contactos, puede ser una tarea intimidante. Para empezar, es posible que tengas que gastar miles de dólares en una membresía para obtener una cotización. Es posible que tampoco sepas cuánto dinero estás derrochando: los operadores de aviones privados pueden facturar a los clientes después del viaje si se consumió combustible adicional, por ejemplo.

Pero ahora ha llegado el Uber de la aviación privada. KinectAir tiene como objetivo hacer que los cielos sean más amigables para la gente común que se sumerge en el mundo de los aviones privados. En el sitio web fundado en 2019 para viajes aéreos privados en el noroeste del Pacífico ya se podía reservar un vuelo regular bajo demanda. Pero a partir de diciembre de 2023, podrás aprovechar una oferta en avión privado reservando un vuelo de reposicionamiento de “tramo vacío” en todo Estados Unidos.

Y por una ganga —y de verdad es una ganga (relativa)—. El sitio ofrece viajes rápidos desde alrededor de US$ 111 por persona.

""Queremos cambiar la forma en que la gente piensa sobre los vuelos cortos"", dice la codirectora ejecutiva Katie Buss, expiloto del ejército de EE.UU.

publicidad

“La gente piensa que es solo para los Bill Gates y Elon Musk del mundo. No es barato, pero es más accesible de lo que la mayoría de la gente piensa. En lugar de simplemente ir a Delta, queremos que la gente vea cómo sería volar en privado... Es una forma de viajar totalmente diferente”.

Ella dice que la compañía quiere “revolucionar” el mercado de vuelos privados de la misma manera que lo hizo Uber con los taxis y Airbnb con la industria hotelera.

Aviones más baratos, vuelos más baratos

El sitio utiliza software respaldado por inteligencia artificial para rastrear operadores de aviones privados, dijo a CNN el codirector ejecutivo Ben Howard. ""Estamos dejando que el software haga eso, examinando el pajar para hacerlo más accesible y darles (a los clientes) una mejor oportunidad de organizar el viaje que realmente desean"", aseguró.

Y para mantener los precios bajos, están trabajando con aviones turbohélice y con motor de pistón. Ambos son más baratos de manejar que un avión normal, aunque vuelan más lento. Esa diferencia de velocidad, sin embargo, es menos crucial en un vuelo de menos de 500 millas, dice Howard, quien afirma: ""Si vuelas en un avión al mismo lugar, pagarías cinco veces más y lo harías en algunos minutos más rápido”.

Sin embargo, la forma en que realmente están bajando los precios de los vuelos es a través de vuelos de reposicionamiento de “tramos vacíos”, donde el avión ya ha sido reservado para un viaje y puede recoger pasajeros para llevarlos al siguiente destino reservado.

KinectAir afirma que sus ofertas de tramos vacíos tienen un descuento de hasta el 75% del precio normal de un avión privado. La mayoría de las ofertas son para reservas con poca tiempo de anticipación: según sus datos durante el verano, tres cuartas partes de todas las reservas se realizaron dentro de las 72 horas previas al viaje, lo que significa que los tramos vacíos también se generaron de último minuto.

Como piloto, Buss dice que la compañía solo agregará operadores que superen sus calificaciones de seguridad.

Más barato que volar en avión comercial

Algunos de los precios que anuncia KinectAir incluso son menores a los de aerolíneas comerciales en clase económica, cuando se trata de tarifas de último minuto.

Un vuelo vacío esta semana desde el aeropuerto Phoenix-Mesa Gateway a Palm Springs estaba a la venta por US$ 698, o US$ 233 por persona en el avión de tres plazas.

La tarifa directa más barata de ida que CNN pudo encontrar durante la próxima semana de Phoenix a Palm Springs fue de US$ 300, volando desde Sky Harbor International el 14 de diciembre en clase económica. Esa tarifa incluye la asignación de asiento gratuita, pero no el equipaje documentado, que costaría US$ 30 adicionales. Un asiento de primera clase costaría US$ 425 por trayecto, casi el doble del precio del trayecto vacío de KinectAir.

Por US$ 264 se puede elegir un vuelo con Sun Country Airlines, pero el viaje duraría 40 horas, con escala en Minneapolis.

Y, por supuesto, no hay largas colas ni TSA cuando se vuela en privado.

Si observamos a otro agente en línea, la oferta más barata de Phoenix a Palm Springs fue de US$ 3.198 por un avión de cinco plazas, o US$ 639,60 por persona.

La aerolínea semiprivada JSX, que opera desde terminales aéreas privadas pero vende asientos individuales en sus aviones, no vuela en esa ruta. Sin embargo, en una ruta de longitud similar de Phoenix a Las Vegas, los precios comienzan en US$ 249 por persona.

""En muchos casos, los vuelos de última hora son más caros por asiento que los comerciales, y eso sin contar los boletos de primera clase"", afirma Howard.

“En nuestro caso, hay que llenar el avión al máximo, pero si una familia de cuatro personas vuela en el último momento, esta es una muy buena opción. United podría cobrar tanto como un vuelo privado”.

El vuelo más barato a la venta actualmente es desde Sunriver, Oregon, a Aurora, también en Oregon, el 10 de diciembre, por US$ 333 para una avioneta Diamond DA62 de tres plazas, o US$ 111 por persona para el vuelo de 48 minutos.

El tramo vacío más caro es un vuelo de Spokane, Washington, a Bozeman, Idaho, el 13 de diciembre. El avión para ocho personas cuesta US$ 1.792 dólares por el vuelo de 71 minutos, o US$ 224 dólares por persona.

No hay cuotas de membresía ni tarifas de transacción, como cobran muchos competidores.

Wheels Up, por ejemplo, cobra una tarifa de iniciación mínima de US$ 2.995, con una membresía mínima de US$ 2.495 a partir del segundo año. NetJets también requiere que los usuarios sean miembros, al igual que UberJets. Las tarifas de KinectAir están incluidas en el precio que ves. Y puede ver esos precios sin entregar sus datos ni programar una llamada telefónica, como lo hace con Wheels Up, NetJets o UberJets.

Si bien normalmente reservar un avión privado significa hacer un presupuesto (y recibir la factura final después del vuelo, una vez que se haya calculado el combustible adicional), garantiza que el precio que te cotizan es el precio que pagas.

""Entendemos estadísticamente la probabilidad de que ocurran (costos adicionales de combustible), tenemos buenos modelos climáticos, sabemos que es menos costoso volar en una dirección que en otra, por lo que KinectAir absorbe la variabilidad"", dice Howard. ""Queremos que la aviación privada funcione más como la comercial"".

El competidor más cercano de KinectAir es Airble, que no cobra cuotas de membresía, ofrece tarifas reales, no estimaciones, y tiene una página de ""ofertas"" para vuelos con tramos vacíos. Airble también permite a los usuarios reservar un vuelo privado, pero marcarlo como “vuelo compartido”, lo que abre la posibilidad de reservar asientos para otros usuarios, lo que reduce el precio por pasajero. El viaje de ida más barato de Phoenix a Palm Springs esta semana cuesta US$ 10.740 para ocho personas, o US$ 1.342,50 por pasajero.

Mirando hacia el futuro

Por supuesto, es una medida potencialmente polémica abrir una compañía de aviones privada a medida que se intensifica la crisis climática.

Un estudio de 2021 realizado por la organización medioambiental sin fines de lucro Transport & Environment encontró que el 1% de las personas eran responsables de la mitad de todas las emisiones globales derivadas de los vuelos. La industria de los aviones privados está en auge y se expandió un 31% entre 2005 y 2019. Es más, el 40% de los vuelos privados son “vuelos fantasma”, sin pasajeros mientras se reposicionan para su siguiente viaje.

Howard dice que llenar esos vuelos fantasmas ""es una forma de hacer que los vuelos sean más eficientes"". Añade que los aviones turbohélice y de pistón queman menos combustible que los aviones tradicionales.

Debido a que los jets privados tienden a realizar vuelos cortos, eso los hace menos sustentables ambientalmente: en Europa, por ejemplo, existe una alternativa por ferrocarril para el 80% de las rutas de vuelos privados más populares, dijo a CNN en 2022 Matteo Mirolo, gerente de políticas de aviación sustentable de Transporte y Medio Ambiente. Estados Unidos se encuentra en una situación diferente en lo que respecta al transporte público, sin embargo, viajar en tren no es una opción fácil en la mayor parte del país.

Pero en ese momento, Mirolo dijo que debido a su tamaño más pequeño, los jets privados tienen el potencial de estar a la vanguardia para adaptarse a las nuevas tecnologías a medida que salen al mercado, y Howard dice que la plataforma también es un primer paso hacia la preparación para los aviones eléctricos e híbridos del futuro, que se espera que comiencen con aviones pequeños.

En el futuro, la compañía espera empezar a vender asientos individuales, aunque dicen que llevará algún tiempo.","['cuestan', 'que', 'estilo', 'para', 'viajes', 'el', 'privado', 'la', 'una', 'uber', 'vuelos', 'en', 'los', 'más', 'es', 'por', 'están', 'esto']","En el sitio web fundado en 2019 para viajes aéreos privados en el noroeste del Pacífico ya se podía reservar un vuelo regular bajo demanda.

549,"¿Quién es Yahya Sinwar, el dirigente de Hamas que Israel calificó de ""muerto andante""?","Militantes de Hamas abren fuego contra una parada de autobús 1:37

(CNN) -- El primer ministro de Israel dijo este miércoles que las fuerzas israelíes habían rodeado la casa de Yahya Sinwar, acercándose potencialmente al máximo responsable de Hamas en Gaza y al hombre más buscado por las autoridades israelíes.



Las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel (FDI) dijeron que Sinwar no estaba en la residencia y se creía que estaba escondido bajo tierra en Gaza, pero un alto asesor del primer ministro Benjamin Netanyahu dijo este miércoles que era ""solo una cuestión de tiempo antes de que lo atrapemos"".

Israel ha acusado públicamente a Sinwar de ser el ""cerebro"" detrás del ataque terrorista de Hamas contra Israel del 7 de octubre, aunque los expertos afirman que es probable que sea uno de varios, lo que lo convierte en uno de los objetivos clave de su guerra en Gaza.

Sinwar, figura de larga trayectoria en el grupo islamista palestino, fue responsable de la construcción del ala militar de Hamas antes de forjar nuevos e importantes lazos con las potencias árabes regionales como líder civil y político del grupo.

Fue elegido miembro del principal órgano decisorio de Hamas, el Politburó, en 2017 como líder político de la rama de Hamas en Gaza. Sin embargo, desde entonces se ha convertido en el líder de facto del Politburó, según una investigación del Consejo Europeo de Relaciones Exteriores (ECFR, por sus siglas en inglés).

El Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos lo considera terrorista global desde 2015 y recientemente ha sido sancionado por el Reino Unido y Francia.

Harel Chorev, investigador principal del Centro Moshe Dayan de Estudios sobre Medio Oriente y África de la Universidad de Tel Aviv, afirmó que, si bien Sinwar es una pieza clave dentro de Hamas, no debería considerársele su único líder.

""Se le percibe como el de mayor rango porque tiene un perfil público muy alto, pero Hamas no funciona así"", afirmó. ""Hamas es una organización descentralizada con varios centros de poder separados y él es uno de ellos"".

Chorev dijo que, aunque Sinwar es una figura prominente, forma parte de un ""triunvirato"" de funcionarios de Hamas responsables del atentado del 7 de octubre, junto con Mohammed al-Masri, conocido popularmente como Mohammed Deif, comandante de las Brigadas Al-Qassam, brazo militar de Hamas, y el adjunto de Deif, Marwan Issa.

Sinwar, con cabellos cano y ojos oscuros hundidos bajo unas cejas prominentes es, por mucho, el más conocido y reconocible de los tres, pero fue Deif quien anunció los atentados del 7 de octubre.

Pero mientras Sinwar ha pasado los últimos años dando discursos y siendo fotografiado, Deif es una figura extremadamente reservada y sombría a la que no se ha visto en público en décadas.

""Muerto andante""

Sinwar nació en 1962 en un campo de refugiados de Khan Younis, al sur de Gaza. Su familia fue desplazada de Al-Majdal, un pueblo palestino situado en la actual Askhelon, durante la guerra árabe-israelí.

Se unió a Hamas a finales de la década de 1980 y se convirtió en uno de los fundadores de su temido aparato de inteligencia interna, conocido como el Majd.

Fue condenado en 1988 por participar en el asesinato de dos soldados israelíes y cuatro palestinos sospechosos de colaborar con Israel, y pasó más de dos décadas en una prisión israelí.

Sinwar declaró posteriormente que había pasado esos años estudiando a su enemigo, incluso aprendiendo a hablar hebreo.

Fue liberado en 2011 como parte del acuerdo por el que se intercambiaron más de 1.000 prisioneros palestinos por Gilad Shalit, un soldado de las FDI que había sido capturado y llevado a Gaza, donde permaneció retenido más de cinco años.

En aquel momento, Sinwar calificó el intercambio de ""uno de los grandes monumentos estratégicos de la historia de nuestra causa"".

Chorev dijo que a su liberación contribuyó el hecho de que su hermano fuera uno de los secuestradores de Shalit e insistiera en que se le incluyera en el trato.

De vuelta en Gaza, Sinwar ha ascendido en el escalafón y se ha convertido rápidamente en una pieza clave dentro de Hamas. Chorev dijo que se hizo conocido por su brutalidad y la violencia que inflige a cualquiera del que sospeche traición o colaboración.

""Es bien sabido que, mientras estuvo en prisión, torturó a personas, en su mayoría miembros de Hamas, utilizando (una) plancha caliente para causarles quemaduras... su papel en el Majd dice mucho de su carácter, de su crueldad. Pero al mismo tiempo, los israelíes que lo conocieron dijeron que también puede ser muy práctico, discutiendo abiertamente las opciones"", dijo Chorev.

Como dirigente político de Hamas, Sinwar se centró en las relaciones exteriores del grupo. Según el ECFR, fue el responsable de restablecer la relación de Hamas con los dirigentes egipcios, que recelaban del apoyo del grupo al Islam político, y de conseguir financiación militar continuada de Irán.

Sinwar estaba considerado un decisor vital y probablemente el principal punto de contacto dentro de Gaza durante las intensas negociaciones sobre la devolución de los más de 240 rehenes tomados en el enclave por Hamas en los atentados del 7 de octubre. En las conversaciones participaron altos cargos de Israel, Hamas, Estados Unidos, Qatar y Egipto.

""Al final del día hay dos personas"" encima de las negociaciones, dijo Gershon Baskin, un conocido activista israelí por la paz que participó en la liberación de Shalit, el soldado israelí, en 2011. ""Uno es Yahya Sinwar por parte de Hamas, y el otro es Benjamin Netanyahu por parte israelí"".

Más de 100 rehenes israelíes y extranjeros fueron liberados por Hamas y 240 prisioneros y detenidos palestinos liberados por Israel como parte de una tregua ganada en esas conversaciones, antes de que el alto el fuego temporal se derrumbara el 1 de diciembre, con Israel y Hamas culpándose mutuamente del fracaso.

A Sinwar se le ha llamado de muchas maneras en los últimos dos meses: el portavoz militar israelí, teniente coronel Richard Hecht, calificó a Sinwar de ""rostro del mal"" y lo declaró ""muerto andante"". Los medios de comunicación israelíes lo compararon con Osama bin Laden, mientras que un perfil publicado por las FDI lo apodó ""el carnicero de Khan Younis"".

Pero Chorev dijo que a pesar de su posición en el centro de atención, Sinwar es sólo uno de los muchos comandantes que Israel necesita eliminar antes de que pueda decir que ha ""destruido a Hamas"".

""En pocas palabras, si Israel mata a Sinwar, no significa necesariamente que vaya a derrocar a Hamas. Sin embargo, Hamas puede ser derribada aunque Sinwar siga vivo... porque no es (una orgnización jerárquica). Para que Israel destruya Hamas, tiene que destruir una masa crítica de centros de poder, no solo a él"", afirmó.","['que', 'hamas', 'y', 'yahya', 'quién', 'israel', 'el', 'la', 'del', 'en', 'dirigente', 'sinwar', 'los', 'muerto', 'es', 'por']","Fue elegido miembro del principal órgano decisorio de Hamas, el Politburó, en 2017 como líder político de la rama de Hamas en Gaza.

553,"Estaba en Puerto Rico y le escribió a su mamá: ""Conocí a mi esposo"". Esto fue lo que pasó después","Isis y Michael se conocieron de vacaciones en Puerto Rico y conectaron al instante. Crédito: Isis Bradford

(CNN) -- Hacía apenas unas horas que Isis Woods había conocido a Michael Bradford cuando le envió un mensaje de texto a su madre, presa de la emoción.



""Mamá, conocí a mi marido"", escribió con el teléfono en una mano y un cóctel en la otra.

""¿Estás borracha?"", respondió la madre de Isis.

""Sí"", dijo Isis. ""Y acabo de conocer a mi marido"".

Era el otoño de 2018 e Isis, que entonces tenía 23 años, estaba de vacaciones en Puerto Rico, disfrutando de lo que ella llama su ""primer viaje adulto"".

Viajaba con su mejor amiga, que acababa de graduarse de la universidad. Isis, estudiante de magisterio, casi había terminado también sus estudios, y las dos amigas decidieron que se merecían un momento para celebrarlo y explorar algún lugar nuevo.

publicidad

Se decidieron por Puerto Rico como destino de vacaciones porque era fácil volar hasta allí desde su casa de Atlanta, Georgia, pero además porque era un lugar que prometía muchas cosas para ver y hacer.

Las amigas llegaron al archipiélago caribeño dispuestas a tomar el sol en la playa, ir a bares y comer bien. El viaje tuvo un comienzo difícil cuando vieron que su departamento en Airbnb no se parecía en nada al anuncio, pero la amiga de Isis salvó la situación, al usar sus puntos de hotel para reservar una estancia de última hora en el lujoso La Concha Renaissance San Juan Resort, frente a la playa.

Mientras Isis contemplaba la playa frente al hotel, sintió que se relajaba y que entraba en modo vacacional.

""Nos sentíamos tan elegantes"", dice hoy Isis a CNN Travel.

Después de deshacer las maletas en La Concha, llamó a su hermana para ponerla al día del viaje, contarle lo de la mejora del alojamiento y hablarle de sus primeras impresiones de Puerto Rico.

Su hermana mencionó que un chico que conocía de la universidad también estaba en San Juan de vacaciones.

""¿Hay algún festival o algo por el estilo ahora mismo?"", le preguntó a Isis; parecía una coincidencia que dos personas que conocía estuvieran de vacaciones en el mismo lugar al mismo tiempo.

""No, no lo creo"", dijo Isis. ""Supongo que coincidimos"".

Más tarde, preparándose para la noche, Isis empezó a sentirse un poco nerviosa por salir a un lugar nuevo con la única compañía de su amiga. Recordó que su hermana había mencionado al chico que conocía y empezó a preguntarse si tal vez podrían ir con él y sus amigos, al menos al principio de la noche.

Isis envió un mensaje a su hermana, preguntándole si podía pasarle el número de su amigo ""solo para que pudiéramos quedar, sentirnos seguras, salir con un grupo"".

""Y entonces, ella le envió un mensaje privado"", recuerda Isis. ""No sé exactamente lo que dijo. Pero sigue diciéndome que va a imprimirlo en una camiseta, solo para demostrar que ella es la que nos juntó"".

Ese amigo de la universidad de la hermana de Isis era, por supuesto, Michael Bradford.

“Como de película”

Cuando Michael recibió el mensaje de la hermana de Isis, su actitud fue simplemente: ""Cuantos más, mejor"". Estaba en sus vacaciones anuales con varias personas, su mejor amigo entre ellos.

""Me dije: 'Sí, adelante. Ya la estoy pasando bien con mis amigos'"", cuenta Michael hoy a CNN Travel.

Michael y la hermana de Isis formaban parte del mismo grupo de amigos en la universidad, así que estaba intrigado por conocer a Isis. Pero mientras intercambiaban números y hablaban de planes, nadie se planteó la idea de que pudiera estar a punto de encenderse una chispa romántica.

Isis echó un vistazo a la cuenta de Instagram de Michael por curiosidad, pero no quedó muy impresionada.

""Me dije: 'Este chico parece tonto, uno de esos que solo quieren llevar shorts cortos y camiseta ajustada para ligar'"", recuerda.

Pero cuando Isis llamó por teléfono a Michael para confirmar los planes, su impresión de él cambió.

""Cuando hablamos por teléfono, parecía un joven amable"", dice.

Por teléfono, también se produjo una conexión ""instantánea"", como dice Michael.

""Los dos estábamos muy, muy cómodos el uno con el otro"", dice.

Quedaron en encontrarse en un restaurante de San Juan para cenar esa noche.

El momento en que Isis entró en el restaurante y Michael la vio por primera vez fue, dice, ""como de película"". Llevaba un vestido azul brillante y destacaba en el lugar. Se sintió inmediatamente atraído por ella.

""Oh, dios"", pensó.

Isis y su amiga se sentaron y se presentaron. A Isis enseguida le cayó bien Michael, pero sus amigos estaban bastante callados al principio.

Durante la primera parte de la velada, Isis y su amiga estuvieron enviándose mensajes de texto subrepticiamente al otro lado de la mesa: ""Esta gente es rara"".

""Al final empezaron a animarse"", dice Isis. ""Pero en ese momento, Michael y yo estábamos hablando de verdad"".

Isis y Michael habían terminado sentados uno al lado del otro y, al cabo de un rato, Isis había dejado de prestar atención a nadie más. Solo estaba centrada en Michael y él solo tenía ojos para ella.

Se unieron por un interés común en el comercio, descubriendo que ambos estaban interesados en el seguimiento de acciones y participaciones.

""Recuerdo que esa fue la primera conversación realmente interesante que tuvimos"", dice Michael. ""Y luego empezamos a hablar de emprendimientos... y a hablar un poco de todo"".

Isis hablaba de que le encantaba enseñar, pero también de que quería inspirar a la gente de otras maneras, y tal vez montar su propio negocio algún día.

""Lo que eso me dijo fue: 'Eres adaptable, aceptas el cambio, aceptas una mentalidad de crecimiento'"", dice Michael.

Isis y Michael no dejaron de hablar en toda la velada. Esa misma noche, Isis envió un mensaje de texto a su madre. Estaba encantada. Y Michael también.

Los dos pasaron el resto de su estancia en Puerto Rico juntos, reuniendo a sus grupos de amigos cada día.

""Acabamos yendo a la fábrica de Bacardí, que está por allí, y haciendo turismo y cosas juntos"", recuerda Isis.

Sus amigos eran muy conscientes de su creciente conexión. Mientras exploraban Puerto Rico, los amigos de Michael se ofrecían a tomarles fotos.

""Son para el recuerdo"", decían.

El último día, el grupo salió a desayunar juntos y la amiga de Isis fue directa al respecto:

""¿Qué se siente al haber conocido a tu marido y a tu mujer en un viaje?"", preguntó, con una ceja levantada.

""Oye, por favor. Solo nos la estamos pasando bien"", recuerda haber contestado Isis.

Aunque Isis estaba convencida de que Michael formaría parte de su futuro, también intentaba gestionar sus propias expectativas. Ella regresaría a Atlanta, mientras que Michael volaba de vuelta a Washington. Tendrían que intentar mantenerse en contacto a través de varios cientos de kilómetros.

Mientras subía al taxi del aeropuerto, Michael prometió llamarla en cuanto ambos estuvieran en casa.

""Recuerdo que pensé: 'bueno, no tienes por qué hacerlo, no hay que crear expectativas'"", recuerda ella. ""Eso se esfumó totalmente, en mi cabeza, para cuando empezamos a hablar al volver a casa"".

Unidos

Al cabo de un mes, Isis llamaba a Michael y le preguntaba: ""¿me vas a pedir oficialmente que sea tu novia?"".

Michael también quería comprometerse. Su encuentro de vacaciones estaba predestinado.

Pero la hermana de Isis no estaba muy convencida.

""Me dijo: 'no puedo creer que vayas a Puerto Rico y te enamores de mi amigo'. Y yo le dije: '¿por qué estás tan enfadada?’”

""Me dijo que pensaba que yo era una devoradora de hombres, cosa de la que no tenía pruebas. Pero pensó que iba a hacerle daño"".

Isis se sintió frustrada por la reacción de su hermana en aquel momento, pero hoy es más generosa.

""Mirando hacia atrás, de nuevo, es mi hermana, así que conoce todo mi historial de relaciones. Sabe que me separo de la gente con facilidad. No confiaba mucho en los hombres, antes de Michael"".

Por su parte, la madre de Isis, una vez que confirmó que el mensaje de texto de las vacaciones no era solo un mensaje de borrachera, se alegró por su hija.

""Fue muy gracioso, esperaba que mi madre estuviera más preocupada y que mi hermana fuera la que estuviera encantada"", dice Isis. ""Mi madre era la que estaba en la luna"".

""Sigue adelante. Entrará en razón"", aconsejó a su hija. Y al final, tras un par de meses enfrentadas, las hermanas se sentaron y tuvieron una conversación en condiciones sobre la relación de Isis.

Isis dejó claro que iba en serio con Michael, y su hermana aceptó la relación. A partir de entonces, no hizo más que apoyarla.

Durante todo este tiempo, Isis y Michael mantuvieron una relación a distancia. Intentaban quedar una vez al mes, pero no era fácil.

""Los dos teníamos muchas ganas de vernos más de lo que podíamos"", dice Isis.

La pareja empezó a hablar de mudarse juntos a algún lugar nuevo y se decidieron por Dallas, Texas, donde se mudaron en 2019. Los dos estaban entusiasmados con este paso, pero al principio decidieron vivir por separado: Isis y Michael querían tantear el terreno de estar juntos en una nueva ciudad antes de firmar un contrato de alquiler conjunto.

En marzo de 2020, se suponía que se embarcarían en unas vacaciones de regreso a Puerto Rico. Sin embargo, la pandemia de covid-19 arruinó los planes, cancelaron sus vuelos y se refugiaron juntos en el departamento de Michael.

Vivir juntos de repente fue una ""experiencia de aprendizaje"" para ambos, pero sobre todo fue ""algo bueno"", como dice Michael. A medida que la pandemia retrocedía, la pareja estaba más unida que nunca.

Un compromiso sorpresa

Incluso antes de conocerse, Isis y Michael sabían que querían casarse algún día. Y a medida que su relación se desarrollaba durante los dos años siguientes, ambos sabían que el matrimonio era el siguiente paso.

Sin embargo, cuando Michael le propuso casamiento, Isis no se lo esperaba.

Era abril de 2022 y se suponía que la pareja se dirigía a un almuerzo organizado por uno de los amigos de la infancia de Michael.

Isis acababa de regresar de un viaje de trabajo y no se encontraba muy bien. Se había levantado cansada, sufría de migraña y buscaba escaparse del compromiso social.

""No quiero ir"", le dijo a Michael.

""No podemos cancelarlo"", dijo él, inflexible.

""Estás ignorando el hecho de que me duele la cabeza"", dijo Isis, molesta. ""Estás anteponiendo esta fiesta a mi bienestar"".

Michael, con cara de pánico, no cedió, limitándose a decir que le había prometido a su amigo que estarían allí.

""Y así me voy. Y en mi cabeza pienso: 'No sé por qué esto es tan importante para él, pero si es tan importante, me voy a callar. Me voy a tomar mi Tylenol y voy a ir'"", recuerda hoy Isis.

Cuando llegaron, seguía sin enterarse de nada. Solo empezó a preguntarse qué estaba pasando cuando bajaron del auto y todo estaba en silencio.

""Esta es una fiesta muy tranquila"", pensó Isis.

Cuando se abrió la puerta, la casa estaba llena de los seres queridos de Isis.

""Hubo un segundo en el que me quedé congelada y pensé: 'Oh, ¿por qué está aquí mi hermana? ¿Por qué está aquí mi madre? Y entonces rompí en llanto, porque me di cuenta"", dice Isis.

Michael había reunido allí a todos los amigos y familiares de Isis para que presenciaran el momento en el que le pidió que pasaran juntos el resto de sus vidas.

""Fue un día precioso"", dice Isis.

Isis y Michael se casaron cinco meses después, en octubre, en Las Vegas. Ella adoptó el nombre de él, convirtiéndose en Isis Bradford.

La pareja comenzó con planes para mantener celebraciones pequeñas, pero al final más de 100 de sus amigos y familiares se unieron a ellos para celebrar.

El banquete tuvo lugar en la Skyline Terrace Suite del MGM Grand Hotel.

""Fue bonito, porque estábamos todos bailando con el horizonte de Las Vegas a nuestras espaldas"", dice Isis.

El destino de la boda era apropiado para una pareja que se había conocido en vacaciones. Además, a Isis y Michael les gustaba la idea de inspirar a otras personas a hacer un viaje.

""Me gustó mucho que la gente viniera por nosotros y que se quedaran a pasar unas vacaciones en familia, o se quedaran para una reunión de amigos"", dice Isis.

""Fue genial"", coincide Michael.

Para su luna de miel, Isis y Michael eligieron un viaje en crucero que empezaba y terminaba en Puerto Rico, ""donde comenzó nuestra historia"", como dice Michael.

""Fue un poco nostálgico"", dice.

Vivir la vida en equipo

Paseando de la mano con Michael por San Juan, Isis dice sentirse ""muy agradecida"", sobre todo por el hecho de haber encontrado a ""alguien haciendo algo que me gustaba y que le gustaba a él"".

""Nuestro interés común es viajar, nos encanta viajar, nos encanta conocer otras culturas"", coincide Michael. ""Y esta es ahora mi compañera de viaje para siempre"".

La pareja también está unida en su compromiso con sus carreras. Hoy, Isis es empresaria y estratega de marketing digital con su propio negocio, mientras que Michael hace planificación y análisis financiero para una empresa de tecnología.

""Tener una esposa tan creativa e innovadora genera conversaciones que invitan a la reflexión y me permiten añadir algo de color a mi visión en blanco y negro de la planificación financiera"", dice Michael.

""Secundo a Michael"", dice Isis. ""Soy una soñadora y él hace que mis grandes ideas se vuelvan factibles"".

La pareja cree en ""labrar tu propio destino"", tanto en el trabajo como en las relaciones y en la vida en general.

""Creo que casarnos es como manifestar esos sueños y objetivos"", dice Michael.

Isis dice que siempre se aferra a la idea, ante todo, de que ella y Michael están ""en el mismo equipo"" en todo lo que hacen.

Antes de casarse, la pareja decidió ir a terapia prematrimonial, que ellos describen menos como un ""por qué"" y más como una decisión de ""por qué no"".

Lo que más aprendieron de esas sesiones fue que el amor es una ""elección"".

""Yo elijo amarte y tú eliges amarme"", dice Michael. ""Y cada día tenemos que volver a elegir"".

""Elegirnos el uno al otro una y otra vez"", añade Isis.

""Creo que tener esa mentalidad fue muy importante. Porque así es como vamos a seguir creciendo, aprendiendo y amándonos"", dice Michael.

558,5 cosas que hacer cuando estás deprimido,"Estudio advierte aumento en las tasas de depresión en EE.UU. 0:45

(CNN) -- La depresión está aumentando en Estados Unidos. Tanto así que lo más probable es que si no padeces esta enfermedad, conozcas a alguien que sí la sufre.

Casi el 18% de los adultos estadounidenses —más de 1 de cada 6— afirmaron estar actualmente deprimidos o recibiendo tratamiento para la depresión, según una encuesta de Gallup de 2023. En 2015, cuando Gallup empezó a recopilar información sobre el tema, la cifra era inferior al 11%.

Los datos de Gallup muestran que la depresión clínica estaba aumentando lentamente en el país antes de la pandemia, pero creció más rápidamente después de ella, con el aislamiento social, la soledad, el miedo a la infección, el agotamiento psicológico, el abuso de sustancias y la interrupción de la atención de salud mental. Las tasas entre las mujeres, los adultos jóvenes y los adultos negros e hispanos son las que están aumentando más rápidamente.

Para los adolescentes de 12 a 17 años, las estadísticas también son nefastas: Según los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de Estados Unidos, cinco millones de chicos de esas edades —algo más del 20%— sufrieron un episodio de depresión mayor en 2021 (el año más reciente con datos disponibles), y 3,7 millones experimentaron un deterioro grave.

El psiquiatra Charles Raison, profesor de Ecología Humana y Psiquiatría en la Universidad de Wisconsin-Madison, dijo que él mismo ha luchado contra la depresión. Raison, que también es director del Vail Health Behavioral Health Innovation Center y se desempeñaba como experto en salud mental de CNN Health, describió el estado de la salud mental en Estados Unidos en una palabra: ""malo"".

publicidad

""No hay duda de que la depresión, la ansiedad, el suicidio y el abuso de sustancias han ido en aumento en Estados Unidos (...) probablemente durante 20 o 25 años, quizá más"", dijo Raison al Dr. Sanjay Gupta, corresponsal médico jefe de CNN, en el podcast Chasing Life. ""Pero realmente han ido en aumento en los últimos 10 años, y los datos son realmente consistentes"".

""El aumento no es igual en todos los grupos de edad"", dijo Raison. ""Los que más sufren son los jóvenes. Las personas de entre 15 y 35 años son las que sufren un aumento realmente preocupante"".

Aunque el aumento de la depresión entre los estadounidenses es alarmante, lo que también resulta inquietante es la dificultad para determinar la causa. No podemos verla en un escáner cerebral. No disponemos de un análisis de sangre para detectarla. No podemos medir su gravedad con precisión.

Raison comparó la depresión con la ""hidropesía"" -un término anticuado para referirse a un edema-, que podría estar causada por diferentes afecciones o factores subyacentes. ""Podría ser (...) insuficiencia cardiaca. Podría ser una neumonía. Puede ser cáncer. Hay diferentes razones para que se produzcan esos síntomas"", dijo.

""¿Encontraremos alguna vez una prueba para diagnosticar la depresión? No, porque la depresión es como la hidropesía"", dijo, señalando posibles causas subyacentes diferentes.

Y esa puede ser una de las razones por las que la depresión es tan difícil de tratar.

Toma como ejemplo antidepresivos como el Prozac, también conocido por el nombre genérico de fluoxetina. Se lanzó en el país hace 35 años como el primero de una nueva clase de fármacos llamados inhibidores selectivos de la recaptación de serotonina, o ISRS. La idea era que la depresión se debía a un desequilibrio químico en el cerebro y que éste podía corregirse actuando sobre el neurotransmisor serotonina. En 1993 aparecieron los inhibidores de la recaptación de serotonina y norepinefrina (IRSN), que actúan sobre dos neurotransmisores.

Pero los antidepresivos no funcionan para todo el mundo.

""La cuestión del uso de antidepresivos, que son el tratamiento de primera línea para la depresión en Estados Unidos, es increíblemente compleja"", dijo Raison, señalando que son ""salvavidas para algunas personas"".

""Pero a medida que hemos ido avanzando en los últimos 20 años, hemos tenido que metabolizar, como campo, una serie de verdades muy duras sobre los antidepresivos y su eficacia"", dijo. ""Una dura verdad, y la más obvia, es que no funcionan ni de lejos tan bien como pensábamos hace 30 años"", explicó, estimando que solo el 30% de los pacientes ""obtienen una respuesta completa"".

Raison reconoció que intentar hacer cualquier cosa cuando se está deprimido es una batalla cuesta arriba. Y ofreció estos cinco consejos para el autocuidado.

Comprométete a buscar ayuda

Pide cita con un profesional de la salud mental.

""Si te sientes irremediablemente deprimido, si has perdido el interés por la vida, si tu sueño y tu apetito están alterados, si te sientes desesperanzado, si tienes pensamientos de hacerte daño, ese tipo de cosas, eso es la depresión"", dijo Raison. Conseguir ayuda es especialmente importante si has experimentado esos síntomas durante un par de meses.

""Todos los que luchamos contra la depresión sabemos que contar con un médico puede ayudarte, ya sea con psicoterapia o medicamentos o ambas cosas"", dijo.

Las intervenciones sobre el estilo de vida pueden ayudar

Resulta que lo que es bueno para el cuerpo también lo es para el cerebro.

""Trata de hacer el tipo de cosas que harías por tu salud física"", afirma Raison. ""A menudo le digo a la gente: 'Piensa en lo que harías si quisieras ocuparte de la salud de tu corazón y haz lo mismo'. Todas esas cosas también son antidepresivos. Así que controlar el peso corporal, comer alimentos saludables, dormir lo suficiente, hacer suficiente ejercicio, recibir luz solar"".

Estar rodeado de gente

Intenta mantener relaciones cercanas.

""(El consejo) nº 3 a veces es muy difícil cuando estás deprimido. Pero es probablemente la cosa más importante, que es tratar de maximizar nuestras conexiones interpersonales con otras personas"", dijo Raison.

""Si tienes relaciones afectuosas y de apoyo con otras personas es un gran factor de protección contra la depresión. También es un factor que realmente puede ayudarte a superar la depresión"".

No te rindas

Sé persistente en la búsqueda de ayuda.

""La forma en que la gente, especialmente en Estados Unidos, responde a los antidepresivos tiende a ser muy bifurcada"", dijo Raison. ""Hay un pequeño grupo de personas que empiezan a tomar un antidepresivo y se sienten mejor en un par de semanas y la depresión desaparece"", mientras que otras personas luchan contra la depresión crónica.

Así que, si un antidepresivo no funciona, dijo, ""prueba con otro"".

Pero no tengas miedo de seguir adelante. ""Sabemos desde hace tiempo, por ejemplo, que las personas que no responden a un montón de antidepresivos seguidos tienen menos probabilidades de responder al siguiente, pero no tienen menos probabilidades de responder a la psicoterapia"", dijo.

El agradecimiento

Genera un estado de agradecimiento.

""Trabaja para desarrollar una actitud de gratitud"", dijo Raison. Raison admite que hacerlo no siempre es fácil cuando se está deprimido. ""Si puedes convertirlo en un hábito, puede ser muy poderoso tanto para prevenir la depresión como para sentirte mejor si estás deprimido"", dijo.

""Pero realmente han ido en aumento en los últimos 10 años, y los datos son realmente consistentes"".

577,ANÁLISIS | Cómo el punto muerto sobre la ayuda a Ucrania podría tener ramificaciones globales críticas,"¿Por qué Ucrania teme a una disminución de apoyo de Occidente? 3:09

(CNN) -- El paralizante distanciamiento político de Estados Unidos pronto podría cambiar el mundo hacia algo peor.

Casi dos años después del inicio de la guerra en Ucrania, la línea de suministro de armas y municiones de Estados Unidos corre por primera vez peligro real de colapsar, 12 meses después de que el presidente de Ucrania, Volodymyr Zelensky, fuera aclamado como un héroe durante una visita navideña a Washington. La suposición que subyace tras el intento del presidente de Rusia, Vladimir Putin, de borrar a Ucrania del mapa —que Estados Unidos perderá interés en la guerra— está, por tanto, a punto de validarse. Esto podría desencadenar graves consecuencias que sacudirían los cimientos del liderazgo mundial estadounidense, alienarían a los aliados y envalentonarían a los enemigos jurados de Estados Unidos.

En la Cámara de Representantes, controlada por el Partido Republicano, los republicanos de línea dura dedicados a la filosofía ""Estados Unidos primero"" del expresidente Donald Trump quieren cortar por lo sano con Ucrania y abandonarla a su suerte. Un grupo más amplio de republicanos en ambas cámaras del Congreso, mientras tanto, está utilizando la nueva solicitud de ayuda de US$ 60.000 millones del presidente Joe Biden para intentar forzar enormes concesiones en política de inmigración.

Se trata de la última ocasión en la que los legisladores conservadores, que carecen de mandatos para promulgar sus objetivos, mantienen las prioridades de seguridad nacional y la reputación mundial de Estados Unidos como rehenes de sus objetivos políticos internos. La Cámara de Representantes aprobó recientemente un paquete de ayuda de emergencia para reforzar la guerra de Israel contra Hamas, pero incluía recortes a la financiación del Servicio de Impuestos Internos que hicieron imposible que los demócratas del Senado y la Casa Blanca lo aceptaran. Esto se produjo después de que decenas de republicanos se negaran a votar a favor de aumentar la capacidad de endeudamiento del Gobierno en mayo. Su postura obligó al entonces presidente del Senado, Kevin McCarthy, a utilizar a los demócratas para aprobar una medida que evitara un colapso financiero mundial, lo que debilitó fatalmente su permanencia en el cargo.

¿Cuál es la lógica de estas maniobras políticas? Que la Casa Blanca acabará cediendo y capitulando ante las exigencias del Partido Republicano porque las consecuencias de no hacer nada son terribles. Pero dada la cada vez más estrecha mayoría republicana en la Cámara de Representantes, la incapacidad del nuevo presidente Mike Johnson para gobernar y el nihilismo del ala pro-Trump de la conferencia, no hay garantía de que la ayuda a Ucrania se apruebe incluso entonces.

Un terremoto geopolítico cada vez mayor

El conflicto por la ayuda a Ucrania es crítico porque el armamento estadounidense ha sido esencial para el éxito de Kyiv a la hora de repeler la brutal invasión de Putin. La supervivencia del país puede depender de que el flujo de material continúe en medio de un sangriento estancamiento.

Pero la situación tiene ramificaciones que van más allá de la existencia de una sola nación.

Si Estados Unidos permite que un país sea aplastado en una invasión ilegal, planteará graves cuestiones sobre la credibilidad de los acuerdos de defensa y estratégicos que sustentan todo el mundo occidental. Un resultado así aumentaría la posibilidad de que Putin no se detuviera en Ucrania y pusiera sus ojos en otros Estados que en su día estuvieron en la órbita de la antigua Unión Soviética, como Letonia, Lituania o Estonia. Dado que este trío está en la OTAN, una incursión rusa lanzaría a Estados Unidos a una guerra directa con una Rusia con armas nucleares y supondría el riesgo de la Tercera Guerra Mundial.

Además, el abandono de Ucrania enviaría un mensaje a los autoritarios como Putin y el presidente de China, Xi Jinping, de que se puede aplastar impunemente a los adversarios más pequeños y de que el gansterismo geopolítico tiene recompensa. Confirmaría la creencia de los adversarios estadounidenses, incluidas Rusia y China, de que una política nacional envenenada hará imposible que Estados Unidos ejerza el poder de superpotencia y proteja la democracia mundial.

Pero los partidarios de ampliar la ayuda de miles de millones de dólares más a Ucrania también tienen la obligación de explicar —de una manera más eficaz de lo que la administración ha conseguido hasta ahora— por qué continuar redunda en interés de todos los estadounidenses. Este es especialmente el caso cuando muchos votantes luchan contra los altos precios de los comestibles y los tipos de interés, sienten que su propio país va en la dirección equivocada y se preguntan por qué una guerra en el borde de Europa es asunto suyo.

Aquí es donde la posición republicana en el enfrentamiento tiene potencia política. Incluso las figuras más moderadas del Partido Republicano argumentan que el fracaso de la administración Biden a la hora de controlar la oleada de inmigrantes que cruzan la frontera sur significa que no tienen más remedio que utilizar la lucha por la financiación de Ucrania como palanca para endurecer la política de inmigración. El argumento es: si Biden no puede controlar las fronteras estadounidenses, ¿por qué intenta salvar las ucranianas?

""Estoy muy a favor de conseguir apoyo para Ucrania y apoyo para Israel, pero también reconozco que la política real de la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos no dará financiación para Ucrania e Israel a menos que se asegure la frontera"", dijo este miércoles el senador republicano Mitt Romney, de Utah. ""Esa es la realidad"".

Un cisma sobre la política exterior estadounidense

La disputa sobre la financiación de Ucrania es un síntoma de un profundo choque filosófico sobre el papel de Estados Unidos en el mundo que ya está en el centro de la posible revancha de 2024 entre Biden y Trump.

El actual comandante en jefe se inscribe de lleno en la tradición internacionalista de los presidentes estadounidenses desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial, que veían al país como un baluarte de la libertad, la democracia y el imperio de la ley internacional. Sin embargo, el credo de Trump de ""Estados Unidos primero"" procede del aislacionismo tradicional estadounidense. Desprecia la democracia y las alianzas en favor de la persecución de estrechos intereses nacionales y la negociación transaccional con tiranos y demagogos globales. Este cisma entre estas perspectivas probablemente significa que, incluso si el actual punto muerto sobre la financiación de Ucrania se resuelve finalmente, no es más que un anticipo de una larga disputa nacional por venir.

En el nivel más fundamental, el fin del apoyo estadounidense a Ucrania significaría que Estados Unidos estaría abandonando a un pueblo víctima de una invasión no provocada, que ha soportado dos años de matanzas y atrocidades sólo porque quiere tener derecho a elegir el destino y los líderes de su nación.

Si Washington da la espalda, mancharía el liderazgo estadounidense durante décadas, como reconoció implícitamente Biden en un apasionado discurso pronunciado este miércoles en la Casa Blanca.

""Creo que es asombroso que hayamos llegado a este punto en primer lugar"", dijo Biden. ""Las fuerzas rusas están cometiendo crímenes de guerra. Así de simple. Es asombroso. ¿Quién está dispuesto a evitar que Putin rinda cuentas por este comportamiento? ¿Quién de nosotros está realmente dispuesto a hacerlo?"".

El embrollo en el Congreso ya se deja sentir en el frente ucraniano. El representante demócrata Mike Quigley, que copreside el Grupo del Congreso para Ucrania y visitó el país a principios de otoño, declaró este miércoles a Jim Sciutto, de CNN, que los soldados han tenido que ""empezar a racionar sus municiones como haría cualquier ejército sensato"" porque temen que el flujo de proyectiles y balas estadounidenses esté a punto de agotarse.

Un soldado, identificado sólo como Sasha dijo a Anna Coren, de CNN, en el frente: ""Me temo que Ucrania no podrá resistir sin nuestros socios y aliados. Es tan simple como eso"".

¿Qué ocurre si no se detiene a Putin ahora?

En un contexto estratégico más amplio, crecen los temores sobre lo que supondría una pérdida de la ayuda estadounidense a Ucrania cuando su contraofensiva se ha estancado y cuando Putin está logrando reconstituir las fuerzas rusas maltrechas por la guerra, en parte gracias a la ayuda de otros adversarios estadounidenses como Irán y Corea del Norte. Una de las lecciones de la anexión rusa de Crimea en 2014, que no llevó a Occidente a armar a Ucrania, es que si no se detiene a Putin seguirá adelante.

El ministro británico de Asuntos Exteriores, David Cameron, defendió el jueves la continuidad de la implicación estadounidense tras reunirse con líderes republicanos en el Capitolio, señalando que el coste de detener la agresión de Putin ahora palidece en comparación con el precio que Estados Unidos podría tener que pagar más adelante.

""Si Putin consigue una victoria, no será el final de todo esto. Estuve en Tiflis, Georgia, en 2008, cuando tomó parte de ese país y advertí que esto ocurriría"", dijo Cameron, que anteriormente fue primer ministro. ""Y ahora ha ocurrido en Ucrania. Y si dejamos que gane en Ucrania, la próxima vez será en otro sitio, y no será sólo el dinero estadounidense. Eso es un riesgo. Podría ser un país de la OTAN, así que podrían ser vidas estadounidenses"", dijo Cameron en la conferencia del Foro de Seguridad de Aspen en Washington.

La pérdida de Ucrania no sólo repercutiría en Europa. En Asia, donde Estados Unidos se enfrenta a las implicaciones de una China en ascenso, la conclusión de que Estados Unidos abandona a sus amigos podría cambiar los cálculos de Beijing a la hora de sopesar si utilizar la fuerza militar para capturar Taiwán. Y un debilitamiento de la determinación estadounidense podría llevar a los aliados de la región y de Oriente Próximo a dudar de sus garantías de seguridad y a plantearse si buscar su propia red de seguridad nuclear.

El senador republicano Jim Risch, de Idaho, se refirió a este punto, también en el foro de Aspen de este jueves, cuando dijo: ""Si efectivamente Estados Unidos no respalda a Ucrania, me preocupa lo que pensarían nuestros enemigos, pero me preocupa mucho más lo que pensarían nuestros aliados"". Risch, que forma parte de la Comisión de Relaciones Exteriores del Senado, añadió: ""(Si) dicen: 'No podemos contar con Estados Unidos, tenemos que tener armas nucleares', realmente creo que un incumplimiento en Ucrania desencadenaría la mayor carrera nuclear del planeta que jamás hayamos visto"".

La oposición a seguir armando a Ucrania a menudo no se basa en una reflexión tan profunda.

Entre algunos republicanos, a menudo parece estar motivada por la política. Trump parece estar todavía dolido por su primer juicio político en la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos, que se desencadenó cuando trató de presionar a Zelensky para que abriera una investigación sobre Biden.

Sin embargo, el nuevo presidente de la Cámara ha planteado algunas cuestiones válidas. Johnson quiere saber a dónde han ido a parar los miles de millones ya gastados. Y quiere conocer el plan de la administración para poner fin a la guerra. Sin embargo, la situación en Ucrania no se presta a respuestas claras. Putin quiere esperar más que Estados Unidos. Y el único objetivo final para Ucrania bajo un ataque tan despiadado es la supervivencia, dure lo que dure.

El precandidato republicano a la Presidencia Vivek Ramaswamy ha hablado en nombre de muchos escépticos del Partido Republicano respecto a Ucrania mientras intenta encauzar el aislacionismo en la base del partido. Compara el apoyo de Estados Unidos al país con las desventuras ""neoconservadoras"" en Iraq y Afganistán, en un intento de aprovechar el cansancio de los votantes con las largas guerras en el extranjero. Y ello a pesar de que no hay tropas estadounidenses combatiendo en Ucrania.

""Estamos desembolsando más dinero de los contribuyentes para que algún cleptócrata ucraniano pueda comprarse una casa más grande"", dijo Ramaswamy en un furioso intercambio en Fox News este jueves, cuando le preguntaron por qué se sentiría cómodo ""entregando"" Europa del Este a Rusia.

Los argumentos de Ramaswamy pueden funcionar en un debate. Pero ignoran consideraciones estratégicas fundamentales.

Y tampoco responden a la conmovedora pregunta planteada por Sasha, el soldado ucraniano en primera línea. ""Si dejamos que Ucrania se vaya, si dejamos que Putin gane, ¿quién se sentirá seguro? Nadie"".","['tener', 'que', 'y', 'punto', 'el', 'la', 'del', 'podría', 'ramificaciones', 'en', 'muerto', 'los', 'globales', 'sobre', 'estados', 'se', 'ucrania']","La supervivencia del país puede depender de que el flujo de material continúe en medio de un sangriento estancamiento.

(CNN) -- Un juez de Texas dictaminó que una mujer embarazada que demandó al estado solicitando un aborto ordenado por un tribunal puede interrumpir legalmente su embarazo.

La decisión marca un avance significativo en el debate en curso sobre la excepción médica del estado a su controvertida prohibición de los abortos después de seis semanas, una de las más estrictas del país.

Kate Cox, que tiene 20 semanas de embarazo, presentó una demanda esta semana pidiendo al tribunal que bloquee temporalmente la prohibición del aborto en el estado, porque no ha podido realizarse el procedimiento por temor a violar la ley. Al bebé de Cox se le diagnosticó trisomía 18 y no se espera que viva más de unos pocos días fuera del útero, según la demanda.

Se cree que su demanda es uno de los primeros intentos en el país por parte de un individuo que busca un aborto ordenado por un tribunal desde que la Corte Suprema anuló Roe vs. Wade el año pasado, según el New York Times.

Cox, de 31 años, ha estado en tres salas de emergencia diferentes en el último mes debido a calambres severos y fugas de líquidos no identificables, según su demanda. Tuvo dos cesáreas previas y, según la demanda, “continuar con el embarazo la pone en alto riesgo de sufrir complicaciones graves que amenazan su vida y su fertilidad futura, incluida la ruptura uterina y la histerectomía”.

En una audiencia de emergencia el jueves, un juez otorgó una orden de restricción temporal contra el estado que permitiría a Cox abortar de inmediato.

“La idea de que la señora Cox desee desesperadamente ser madre y que esta ley pueda hacer que pierda esa capacidad es impactante y sería un verdadero error judicial”, dijo la jueza Maya Guerra Gamble. ""Así que firmaré el pedido y será procesado y enviado hoy"".

Cox y su esposo estuvieron presentes en la audiencia, que tuvo lugar a través de Zoom, y se emocionaron ante la decisión del juez y se les pudo ver secándose las lágrimas.

Un abogado que representa a Texas argumentó el jueves que los síntomas del embarazo de Cox no cumplían con el estándar establecido por el estado para una emergencia médica que permitiría un aborto.

Johnathan Stone, abogado especial de la oficina del fiscal general del estado, dijo que el médico de Cox tenía la creencia “subjetiva” de que Cox calificaba para un aborto, en lugar de basar su opinión médica en estándares “objetivos” descritos en la ley.

La discusión sobre las razones médicas subjetivas versus objetivas para un aborto es fundamental para el debate en curso y las luchas legales sobre la regla de excepción del estado. Los críticos argumentan que la regla es vaga y poco clara, lo que hace que los médicos, que se enfrentan a un delito grave por realizar un aborto ilegal, se abstengan de tomar medidas. El estado mantiene que el lenguaje de la ley es adecuado y claro.

Molly Duane, abogada que representa a Cox, argumentó que el estado estaba cuestionando a los médicos de su cliente y diciendo que Cox no estaba lo suficientemente enferma. Duane trabaja para el Centro de Derechos Reproductivos que, de manera independiente, ha estado involucrado en una batalla judicial contra el estado para buscar claridad sobre la excepción de emergencia médica de Texas.

“Han movido la portería una vez más. Ahora un paciente debe estar a punto de morir antes de que un médico pueda confiar en la excepción”, dijo Duane, calificando la posición de “cruel y peligrosa”.

CNN se comunicó con la oficina del fiscal general de Texas para solicitar comentarios.

La trisomía 18, a veces llamada síndrome de Edwards, es una afección cromosómica que puede causar defectos cardíacos y otras anomalías orgánicas. En aproximadamente la mitad de los casos, el feto muere antes de nacer. Muchos niños que nacen con ella mueren a los pocos días y más del 90% mueren al año.

Los abogados del estado argumentaron que la condición de Cox, tal como se establece en los documentos judiciales, no era lo suficientemente grave como para cumplir con el estándar de excepción médica del estado y que el juez esencialmente cambiaría la ley si concediera la orden de restricción temporal.

La ginecóloga de Cox, la Dra. Damla Karsan, dijo anteriormente que tenía una ""creencia de buena fe"" de que Cox cae bajo la excepción legal a la prohibición del aborto, pero no podía realizar el aborto sin una orden judicial porque ""no puede arriesgarse a perder su licencia médica, cadena perpetua y multas civiles masivas” si los tribunales no aceptan su creencia.

Texas permite abortos después de seis semanas si una mujer experimenta una “emergencia médica”, que se define en la ley como “una condición física potencialmente mortal agravada por, causada por o que surge de un embarazo que, según lo certificado por un médico, pone a la mujer en peligro de muerte o en un riesgo grave de deterioro sustancial de una función corporal importante a menos que se realice un aborto”.

Un grupo de 20 mujeres y dos médicos han estado luchando contra el estado de Texas en otra demanda por la excepción médica de este año, argumentando que el lenguaje de la ley no es claro y hace que los médicos se abstengan de realizar abortos en casos graves debido a una falta de claridad en la ley.

Ante la Corte Suprema de Texas la semana pasada, un abogado de la oficina del fiscal general del estado argumentó que la ley era clara y que si las mujeres con problemas médicos potencialmente mortales no abortaban, entonces debería considerarse negligencia por parte del médico.

Cox dijo que aunque ha ido a la sala de emergencias tres veces con cólicos severos, la ley es demasiado vaga para dejar claro si un aborto en esas circunstancias sería legal.

“No quiero continuar con el dolor y el sufrimiento que ha plagado este embarazo. No quiero exponer mi cuerpo a los riesgos de continuar con este embarazo”, dijo Cox en un comunicado difundido por el Centro de Derechos Reproductivos, que presentó la demanda en el condado de Travis.

Cox escribió en un artículo de opinión para The Dallas Morning News que a su bebé por nacer le diagnosticaron trisomía 18 completa.

""Estoy tratando de hacer lo mejor para mi hija, para mí y para mi familia, pero estamos sufriendo debido a las leyes de Texas"", escribió Cox. “No quiero que mi bebé llegue a este mundo sólo para verla sufrir”.

“Necesito interrumpir mi embarazo ahora para tener las mejores posibilidades para mi salud, para criar a mis hijos y para un embarazo futuro”, añadió.","['mujer', 'legalmente', 'que', 'juez', 'texas', 'y', 'para', 'puede', 'estado', 'su', 'el', 'la', 'del', 'una', 'en', 'cox', 'interrumpir']","Kate Cox, una madre de dos hijos de 31 años de Dallas-Fort Worth, demandó al estado de Texas para poder abortar.

(CNN Español) –– La vicepresidenta de Ecuador, Verónica Abad Rojas, escribió un mensaje de despedida este viernes en X, antes Twitter, y compartió fotos en las que se la ve abrazando a sus hijos, mientras salía del país rumbo a Tel Aviv.

""No voy a negar que me invade la tristeza por tener que alejarme de mi tierra, mi gente y mi familia, pero ecuatorianos, vienen días mejores"", expresó Abad Rojas en su publicación. ""Hoy emprendo este viaje, con mucha ilusión de mejores días para nuestro país"", puntualizó. ""Me los llevo en el corazón"".

Abad Rojas, de 47 años y quien el 23 de noviembre asumió como vicepresidenta de Daniel Noboa, fue nombrada por el jefe de Estado como de embajadora extraordinaria y plenipotenciaria ante el Estado de Israel.

Vicepresidenta Abad: No estoy contenta con ser embajadora de paz 3:21

En su decreto, Noboa recordó el artículo 147 de la Constitución de Ecuador que prevé, como una de las atribuciones del presidente, nombrar y remover embajadores y jefes de misión.

El joven mandatario de 36 años dispuso que la vicepresidenta debe presentarse físicamente en la Embajada de Ecuador en Tel Aviv, el domingo 10 de diciembre.

La vicepresidenta aceptó en noviembre la designación como ""embajadora por la paz"" en Israel que el presidente Noboa le encargó apenas un día después de haber asumido la vicepresidencia. Sin embargo, expresó que no estaba contenta con la decisión y dijo que va en contra de su proyecto político.

Abad Rojas mantendrá su cargo como vicepresidenta, pero cumplirá la única función de embajadora que le ha encomendado el mandatario. Aún no se sabe cuánto tiempo estará en Israel.

""El Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Movilidad Humana, junto con la vicepresidenta de la República y el Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas, coordinarán acciones necesarias tendientes al pago de la remuneración de la señora Vicepresidenta, emolumentos y demás beneficios de por norma le corresponda"", explicó el presidente Noboa en el decreto.

Llamado a la Tierra es una serie editorial de CNN comprometida con reportar los desafíos ambientales que enfrenta nuestro planeta, además de mostrar las soluciones a esos retos. La Iniciativa Perpetual Planet de Rolex se ha asociado con CNN para crear conciencia y educación sobre los asuntos de sostenibilidad claves y para inspirar acciones positivas.

(CNN Español) -- En el corazón de Quito, en medio del cemento que caracteriza a las grandes urbes, un corredor biológico se abre paso, repoblando a la ciudad con la flora y fauna nativas de un país megadiverso.

El corredor biológico forma parte del proyecto ""Reconectar"", que nació en septiembre de 2022. Se ubica a lo largo de la Avenida Mariana de Jesús entre los parques La Carolina y Rumipamba, a los que une.

Los beneficios de la fauna nativa en las ciudades

El corredor se ha vuelto un espacio de interacción de especies animales y vegetales que incluyen abejas, mariposas, colibríes y plantas endémicas como la ñackak, la salvia rosada y la santa maría.

La ejecución del proyecto cuenta con el apoyo de la fundación Great Leaf, una organización sin fines de lucro enfocada en la conservación y restauración de ecosistemas ecuatorianos. Lidera la iniciativa Liliana Jaramillo, una bióloga apasionada por la conservación que es cofundadora de la organización

""Las plantas nativas en un espacio urbano tienen varios beneficios para empezar, crean un espacio de biodiversidad donde crean hábitat y alimento para muchas especies"", explica Jaramillo.

Además, los espacios verdes ""pueden ser esponjas donde se pueda retener el agua de lluvia"" y ""ayudan a regular la temperatura en la ciudad"", agrega.

""Una planta en la ciudad no necesariamente va a cambiar todo, pero muchas plantas en la ciudad lo pueden hacer"", dice, y vincula el proyecto con el orgullo que siente como originaria de Ecuador, uno de los países megadiversos del planeta.

Los voluntarios, clave para el éxito del corredor

La sostenibilidad de este proyecto depende en gran parte de los voluntarios, que son el brazo ejecutor para la propagación de esta red de 1,5 km de áreas verdes.

Para ellos la experiencia es muy satisfactoria.

""Es algo hermoso colaborar de alguna manera con un granito de arena para conservar el medio ambiente que sea más sano, más saludable"", cuenta Bertha Calle, auxiliar de Enfermería que además aporta como voluntaria de Reconectar.

El involucramiento de la población local es clave para el éxito del proyecto. Así lo explica Andrea Narváez, cofundadora de Great Leaf: ""No existe una solución sin participación ciudadana y refiriéndonos a las ciudades y lugares urbanos. No sirve de nada que plantemos árboles si no va haber personas involucradas en proteger esa zona que ha sido recuperada"".

Jaramillo, por su parte, apunta al hecho de que cada persona, desde su espacio, puede trabajar en soluciones para la naturaleza: ""Hay muchos hábitos que podemos cambiar muchas decisiones que podemos hacer para contribuir de una pequeña forma a la mitigación del cambio climático”.

El proyecto también incluye una óptica de género.

“El hecho de que lideremos el proyecto mujeres puede estar generando un impacto en la sociedad y que las mujeres nos sintamos parte de las soluciones”, dice al respecto Narváez.

Con el apoyo de científicos, voluntarios, vecinos y organismos públicos y privados, el corredor se está convirtiendo en un pulmón de la ciudad que reconecta a las personas con la sustentabilidad. Es ""una bendición"", dice Calle, porque ""da vida en medio de una ciudad tan convulsionada, tan contaminada"". ""Da vida, da alegría"".","['que', 'para', 'y', 'megadiverso', 'población', 'fauna', 'el', 'la', 'quito', 'una', 'en', 'país', 'proyecto', 'los', 'reconecta', 'las', 'flora']","(CNN Español) -- En el corazón de Quito, en medio del cemento que caracteriza a las grandes urbes, un corredor biológico se abre paso, repoblando a la ciudad con la flora y fauna nativas de un país megadiverso.

(CNN Business) -- La filántropa MacKenzie Scott está de buen humor en estas fiestas.

Scott anunció el miércoles US$ 2.150 millones en donaciones durante el último año en su sitio web, Yield Giving. Dijo en la publicación que la organización sin fines de lucro donó a 360 organizaciones, ""a cada una de las cuales le vendrían bien más aliados"".

Las causas fueron muy diversas. Hizo donaciones a la Asociación de Periodistas Asiático-Americanos (una cantidad no revelada) y US$ 12 millones a la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Howard. Organizaciones que brindaron ayuda a comunidades rurales en la India, servicios de entrega de píldoras abortivas y varios servicios de asistencia legal también recibieron donaciones.

Yield Giving mantiene una base de datos de montos de donaciones de organizaciones filantrópicas. Casi todas las cantidades reveladas ascendieron a millones, y varias, como Canopy Planet (justicia ambiental), Start Early (desarrollo infantil) y Malaria Consortium, ascendieron a 10 millones de dólares. Algunas donaciones alcanzaron los US$ 20 millones.

En 2022, Scott dijo que su equipo había donado más de US$ 3.800 millones a 465 organizaciones en el transcurso de nueve meses. Ha donado US$ 436 millones a Habitat for Humanity y US$ 84,5 millones a Girl Scouts of the USA, la donación más grande jamás realizada por un solo individuo.

Scott es conocida por sus comportamientos filantrópicos y donaciones sorpresa a organizaciones. Scott ayudó a construir el gigante tecnológico Amazon con su entonces esposo Jeff Bezos. La pareja se divorció en 2019. Actualmente tiene un patrimonio neto de US$ 33.700 millones, según el Índice de multimillonarios de Bloomberg.","['donaciones', 'benéficas', 'y', 'último', 'millones', 'mackenzie', 'el', 'la', 'su', 'una', 'en', 'organizaciones', 'cientos', 'scott', 'donó']","Exesposa de Jeff Bezos dona US$ 4.200 millones 0:53(CNN Business) -- La filántropa MacKenzie Scott está de buen humor en estas fiestas.

619,La vacuna más reciente contra el covid-19 ya está aquí. Te contamos dónde y cuándo vacunarte,"EE.UU. reporta aumento de casos de covid-19, ¿cómo protegerse? 4:44

(CNN) -- Ahora que la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos y los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE.UU. (FDA y CDC por sus siglas en ingles, respectivamente) dieron su visto bueno, no tendrás que esperar mucho para recibir la vacuna contra el covid-19 actualizada. Las principales cadenas de farmacias ya han empezado a ofrecer citas para vacunarse.



Los fabricantes afirman que las vacunas de ARNm modificado de Moderna y Pfizer/BioNTech son eficaces contra la cepa EG.5, actualmente dominante en Estados Unidos, así como contra otras variantes emergentes.

Las autoridades sanitarias instan a la población a vacunarse lo antes posible. Los casos y hospitalizaciones por covid-19 siguen aumentando y la amenaza de otros virus respiratorios, como la influenza y el VSR, se cierne sobre este otoño boreal. Por primera vez, hay vacunas disponibles contra los tres.

Esto es lo que necesitas saber sobre cuándo y dónde vacunarte para mantenerte sano este otoño.

Quién debe vacunarse

Todas las personas a partir de los 6 meses de edad deben recibir la vacuna actualizada contra el covid-19, según los CDC.

El Comité Asesor sobre Prácticas de Inmunización de los CDC, un grupo de expertos que asesora a la agencia en materia de vacunas, declaró este martes que todas las personas a partir de los 5 años de edad deberían recibir este año al menos una dosis de la vacuna actualizada de ARNm contra el covid-19.

publicidad

Los niños de 6 meses a 4 años que se vacunen por primera vez deben recibir dos dosis de la vacuna de Moderna y tres dosis de la vacuna contra el covid-19 de Pfizer, y al menos una de las dosis debe ser de la vacuna actualizada.

El comité también recomendó que las personas con inmunodeficiencia moderada o grave reciban al menos tres dosis de la vacuna contra el covid-19, y que al menos una de ellas sea la vacuna actualizada. También tienen la opción de recibir una vacuna actualizada adicional más adelante en el año.

El comité no ha decidido si los mayores de 65 años necesitarán otra dosis de la vacuna actualizada dentro de unos meses. La mayoría de los adultos mayores cumplieron los requisitos para recibir una segunda dosis de la vacuna bivalente contra el covid-19 la pasada primavera boreal.

""El comité está muy comprometido con la equidad, para asegurarse de que todo el mundo en nuestro diverso país tenga acceso a la vacuna"", dijo el Dr. William Schaffner, profesor de la División de Enfermedades Infecciosas del Centro Médico de la Universidad de Vanderbilt en Nashville y exdirector médico de la National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.

Esto significa recomendar más dosis a las personas con mayor riesgo de enfermedad grave, como los mayores de 65 años, las personas con sistemas inmunológicos debilitados o enfermedades subyacentes y las personas que viven en residencias de ancianos o están embarazadas.

Son estas personas las que más se beneficiarán de las nuevas vacunas, según el Dr. Dan Barouch, director del Centro de Virología e Investigación de Vacunas del Centro Médico Beth Israel Deaconess, que no participó en el desarrollo de ninguna de las nuevas vacunas, pero que anteriormente colaboró en el estudio de la vacuna de Johnson & Johnson.

""El objetivo principal de estas vacunas es reducir el riesgo de enfermedad grave, que es un objetivo muy importante, pero no es probable que estos refuerzos proporcionen una protección franca contra la adquisición de la infección y probablemente solo un efecto modesto sobre la enfermedad leve"", dijo. ""Así pues, es probable que estos refuerzos sean importantes para las personas que corren un riesgo grave de contraer la enfermedad"".

También se espera que la influenza y el VRS circulen este otoño e invierno, creando una triple amenaza de infecciones pulmonares.

Las vacunas anuales contra la influenza ya están disponibles, y los CDC las recomiendan para todos los mayores de 6 meses en septiembre y octubre, especialmente los niños muy pequeños, las personas con problemas de salud preexistentes, las embarazadas y los adultos mayores.

También hay dos vacunas contra el virus respiratorio sincitial, conocido como VRS, disponibles para las personas de 60 años o más. Ambas son vacunas de dosis única. Schaffner insta a todas las personas de ese grupo de edad a vacunarse contra el VRS, y añade que el virus ""causa tantas enfermedades respiratorias"" como la influenza cada año.

Cuándo vacunarse

Según Schaffner, el momento de ponerse la vacuna actualizada contra el covid-19 depende de cuándo te aplicaron la última. Las personas que recibieron la última vacuna contra el covid-19 hace varios meses o más deben vacunarse en las próximas semanas: de finales de septiembre a octubre.

Pero las personas que hayan recibido recientemente la vacuna bivalente contra el covid-19 o que se hayan infectado recientemente con el virus en sí deben esperar un poco más, dijo.

""Deberían esperar unos tres meses para obtener el máximo beneficio del refuerzo"", dijo Schaffner. ""La mayoría de las vacunas de este tipo tardan unos 10 días en desarrollar una protección completa y, por supuesto, se desarrolla día a día"".

Ese es el tiempo que tarda el organismo en empezar a hacer circular anticuerpos por el torrente sanguíneo, explicó.

Si se aproxima un viaje o un acontecimiento importante, Schaffner dijo, ""dale al menos una semana, incluso dos semanas es mejor"".

Para el RSV, los CDC alientan a los médicos a administrar las nuevas vacunas lo antes posible. Las vacunas contra la gripe deben administrarse durante el mes de octubre, dijo Schaffner, preferiblemente antes de Halloween, un enfoque llamado ""gripe antes del susto"".

Según Schaffner, es completamente seguro que las personas reciban la vacuna contra la gripe y la vacuna contra el covid-19 el mismo día, generalmente una en cada brazo. Agrega que las nuevas vacunas contra el VSR también se pueden administrar al mismo tiempo que otras vacunas, según la recomendación de los CDC.

Sin embargo, señala Schaffner, “la gente ciertamente no está obligada a vacunarse simultáneamente. Si quisieran espaciarlas, es perfectamente comprensible”.

Sin embargo, Schaffner advierte que “una vacuna retrasada es, lamentablemente, a menudo una vacuna que nunca se recibe. Por lo tanto, tendrás que motivarte para buscar la vacuna. Tendrá que ir al consultorio de su médico o a la farmacia dos o tres veces para asegurarse de recibir todas las vacunas para las que es elegible”.

Dónde vacunarse

La nueva vacuna del covid-19 estará disponible en algunas farmacias minoristas de EE.UU. a finales de semana.

""Esperamos que los locales de CVS Pharmacy comiencen a recibir suministros de las nuevas vacunas del covid-19 a finales de esta semana"", dijo CVS en un comunicado a CNN. ""Nuestras farmacias seguirán recibiéndolos de forma continua"".

En este momento, los pacientes pueden programar una cita para la vacuna del covid-19 en los sitios web de CVS y Walgreens.

El director médico de Walgreens, el Dr. Kevin Ban, dijo en un comunicado esta semana: ""Las personas elegibles podrán programar citas dentro de las 24 horas siguientes a la recomendación de los CDC"".

¿Aumentan los casos de covid-19 en EE.UU.? Lo que dicen las autoridades 1:53

Las citas disponibles comenzarán esta semana, dijo Ban, y serán “continuas a medida que las tiendas reciban vacunas”.

Rite Aid también tendrá pronto la nueva vacuna en las tiendas. ""Nuestro programador en línea con citas disponibles para los clientes que deseen recibir la vacuna COVID-19 actualizada estará disponible el viernes 15 de septiembre"", dijo en un comunicado.

La vacuna también estará disponible en consultorios médicos y centros de salud calificados a nivel federal.

Actualmente, las citas para las vacunas contra la gripe y el VSR para adultos mayores están disponibles en CVS y Walgreens, así como en otros minoristas, y en consultorios médicos y clínicas de salud locales.

Costo de las vacunas

La mayoría de las personas con seguro médico podrán recibir su vacuna covid-19 actualizada en el consultorio de su médico o en una farmacia, como CVS o Walgreens, sin costo alguno. Según la Ley del Cuidado de Salud a Bajo Precio, la mayoría de los planes de seguro cubren el costo total de las vacunas covid-19 actualizadas sin copagos.

Las personas que no tienen seguro (alrededor de 28 millones de estadounidenses, según KFF) o que tienen un seguro insuficiente aún pueden tener acceso a la vacuna de covid-19 actualizada de forma gratuita.

Serán elegibles para recibir vacunas de covid-19 gratuitas a través del Programa Bridge Access del Gobierno, que proporcionará vacunas en departamentos de salud y clínicas de salud calificadas a nivel federal. Esta semana se agregarán proveedores de Bridge Access al sitio web Vaccines.gov, lo que ayudará a las personas a encontrar lugares para recibir las vacunas gratuitas.

CVS y Walgreens dicen que ofrecerán la última vacuna de covid-19 a través del programa.

Los niños de familias de bajos ingresos podrán recibir vacunas gratuitas a través del programa Vacunas para Niños de los CDC.

Las vacunas contra la gripe seguirán estando disponibles sin costo a través de la mayoría de los planes de seguro, incluido Obamacare. La Parte B de Medicare también cubre las vacunas contra la gripe para adultos mayores de 65 años.

Las nuevas vacunas contra el VSR para personas mayores pueden requerir receta médica y es posible que no estén cubiertas por el seguro. Si no, las inyecciones cuestan alrededor de US$ 300.

630,Lo que los gases pueden decir sobre tu salud,"Lo que los gases pueden decir sobre tu salud 1:25

(CNN) -- Así como todo el mundo hace caca, todo el mundo tiene gases. Pero las razones por las que uno tiene gases pueden variar, y a veces pueden ser motivo de preocupación.

""Como gastroenterólogo pediátrico, me preguntan sobre esto todo el tiempo"", dice el Dr. Mark Corkins, jefe de la división de Gastroenterología Pediátrica del Centro de Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad de Tennessee. ""Hay dos fuentes de 'gas', y no todo el gas es gas. Parte de lo que expulsamos es aire. Todos tragamos algo de aire, y algunas personas tragan mucho aire. Eso parece que no tiene olor"".

El gas real, por otra parte, es principalmente el subproducto de la fermentación de los alimentos en el colon, dijo Corkins, que también es profesor de pediatría. ""Nuestro colon tiene (miles de millones de) bacterias que viven en él. ... Si no digerimos (los alimentos), las bacterias lo harán"".

En cuanto a la cantidad de espacio que ocupan los gases, el volumen real suele ser mayor y se produce cuando los alimentos se desplazan por el colon, añade.

Expulsar gases ""entre cinco y 15 veces al día... es totalmente normal"", afirma el Dr. William Chey, catedrático de Gastroenterología H. Marvin Pollard de la Universidad de Michigan. ""Esto se debe a que las personas son diferentes en cuanto a la forma en que funciona su tracto (gastrointestinal), el microbioma que vive dentro del tracto gastrointestinal y lo que comen. Todas esas cosas son realmente factores clave para determinar la frecuencia con la que expulsas gases, la cantidad que expulsas y a qué huelen tus gases"".

publicidad

Algunos olores son más penetrantes que otros por estas razones, dicen los expertos, pero no hay olores que sean señales de alerta.

Los gases no son tan indicadores de la salud intestinal como la frecuencia y la textura de las deposiciones. Pero las elecciones dietéticas pueden provocar más o menos gases, y hay ciertos puntos en los que vale la pena mencionar los gases al médico.

Factores de la flatulencia

La flora intestinal es importante porque ayuda al organismo a fabricar vitaminas y a producir algunos de los ácidos grasos de cadena corta que alimentan el revestimiento de nuestro colon, por lo que un poco de gases (procedentes de esos procesos) es bueno, afirma Corkins. ""De lo contrario, no estamos alimentando nuestra flora, que en realidad es una relación simbiótica"", añadió.

Pero lo que puede provocar especialmente gases, o cantidades excesivas de ellos, es comer alimentos que son más difíciles de digerir y, por tanto, más propensos a fermentar, señalaron los expertos.

""El clásico son las alubias, en las que hay una proteína que tiende a ser difícil de digerir"", explica Corkins.

Los fríjoles son una fuente de FODMAP (oligosacáridos, disacáridos, monosacáridos y polioles fermentables). Se trata de hidratos de carbono o azúcares de cadena corta que, en algunas personas, son mal absorbidos por el intestino delgado, lo que provoca problemas digestivos como gases, calambres, diarrea, estreñimiento o hinchazón de estómago. Entre los alimentos ricos en FODMAP se encuentran algunas verduras, frutas, almidones y productos lácteos como la coliflor, el ajo, las manzanas, los melocotones, la leche, el trigo y el jarabe de maíz de alta fructosa.

""Muchos de nosotros comemos muchos FODMAP sin saberlo, pero cada persona tiene un patrón diferente en cuanto a su capacidad para absorberlos y metabolizarlos"", explicó la Dra. Rena Yadlapati, catedrática de medicina del departamento de Gastroenterología de la Universidad de California en San Diego.

""Algunas personas, alternativamente, tendrán problemas cuando coman mucha carne roja"", dijo Chey. ""De hecho, (para) casi todo el mundo, si come suficiente carne roja, no podrá digerirla o absorberla toda adecuadamente, y llegará al colon, donde se fermentará produciendo gases y sustancias químicas"".

Lo mismo puede ocurrir con el exceso de carbohidratos que no se absorben y acaban fermentando en el colon, añadió.

""La otra cosa es asegurarse de que sus hábitos intestinales son regulares"", dijo Chey. ""Las personas estreñidas son mucho más propensas a sufrir hinchazón y flatulencias. La razón es que, si las cosas se mueven muy lentamente por el tracto gastrointestinal, tienen más tiempo para interactuar con las bacterias del tracto gastrointestinal, sobre todo del colon. Y eso va a producir más gases"".

Cómo tratar los gases incontrolables

Si los gases te causan molestias o interfieren en tu vida diaria, debes consultar a un médico, según los expertos. Hay otras cosas que puedes probar.

""Interrogaremos a los pacientes sobre cada uno de esos diferentes factores —dieta, microbioma y función del tracto gastrointestinal— y trataremos de corregir algunas de esas cosas que creemos que pueden estar contribuyendo a los problemas con la flatulencia"", dijo Chey. ""Si alguien está comiendo una dieta occidental típica que contiene una gran cantidad de alimentos procesados y carbohidratos, azúcares, reducir eso y comer una dieta más saludable puede ser realmente útil"".

Una dieta baja en FODMAP ""es probablemente una de las mayores intervenciones que he hablado con los pacientes,"" dijo Yadlapati.

También debes visitar a tu médico si estás teniendo pérdida de peso involuntaria, sangre en las heces o cambios en los hábitos intestinales —especialmente diarrea frecuente— , además de la flatulencia excesiva, Chey y Yadlapati dijeron

""Eso puede ser un signo de infección, inflamación o deficiencias enzimáticas, todo lo cual puede ser identificado y corregido con la ayuda de un proveedor de atención médica"", dijo Chey.

Mientras esperas la cita con el médico, lleva un ""diario de gases"" en el que anotes cuándo tienes gases y qué tipo de actividades físicas y comidas los rodean, para poder empezar a identificar patrones, dijo Yadlapati.

El médico también puede aconsejar el consumo de remedios de venta libre, dijo Chey, como simeticona, carbón activado, aceite de menta con recubrimiento entérico o probióticos.","['decir', 'que', 'pueden', 'y', 'es', 'las', 'el', 'la', 'gases', 'tu', 'en', 'salud', 'los', 'sobre', 'lo', 'son']","Lo que los gases pueden decir sobre tu salud 1:25(CNN) -- Así como todo el mundo hace caca, todo el mundo tiene gases.

631,"La FDA aprueba dos terapias génicas contra la anemia falciforme, llevando esperanza a miles de enfermos","(CNN) -- La Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de EE.UU. (FDA, por sus siglas en inglés) aprobó este viernes dos tratamientos genéticos contra la anemia falciforme, incluido el primero que emplea la técnica de edición genética CRISPR, inaugurando así una nueva era en el tratamiento de enfermedades genéticas.



Los medicamentos, llamados Casgevy y Lyfgenia, son curas potenciales para personas con anemia falciforme, un trastorno hereditario de los glóbulos rojos que debilita y acorta la vida y afecta de forma desproporcionada a los estadounidenses negros.

Casgevy es el tratamiento basado en CRISPR, fabricado por Vertex Pharmaceuticals y Crispr Therapeutics, mientras que Lyfgenia, fabricado por Bluebird Bio, utiliza un enfoque de terapia génica más antiguo. Ambos han sido autorizados para personas mayores de 12 años con antecedentes de crisis vasooclusivas, episodios dolorosos causados por la enfermedad.

""La anemia falciforme es un trastorno sanguíneo raro, debilitante y potencialmente mortal con importantes necesidades no cubiertas"", declaró la Dra. Nicole Verdun, directora de la Oficina de Productos Terapéuticos de la FDA dentro de su Centro de Evaluación e Investigación Biológica. ""Nos complace avanzar en este campo, especialmente para las personas cuyas vidas se han visto gravemente alteradas por la enfermedad, al aprobar hoy dos terapias génicas celulares"".

Casgevy costará US$ 2,2 millones por el tratamiento único, según informó Vertex en un documento regulatorio, mientras que Lyfgenia costará US$ 3,1 millones, según dijo Bluebird en un comunicado.

Un grupo de análisis de precios de medicamentos, el Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, había sugerido que un precio de entre US$ 1,35 y 2,05 millones para cada terapia los habría hecho rentables y animó a las empresas a considerar la fijación de precios de los medicamentos en el extremo inferior de ese rango para permitir un acceso más amplio.

Johnny Lubin es una de las personas más jóvenes que se ha sometido al tratamiento CRISPR, como parte de un ensayo clínico. Antes de someterse a él, recuerda, tenía una preocupación principal.

""Me preocupaba que pudiera tener superpoderes"", dice Johnny, que ahora tiene 15 años y vive en Trumbull, Connecticut, a unos 100 kilómetros al norte de Nueva York.

Para muchos miembros de la comunidad de pacientes con anemia falciforme, las autorizaciones han tardado mucho en llegar. Según los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) de EE.UU., esta enfermedad afecta a unas 100.000 personas en el país, de las que 1 de cada 365 es de raza negra, y la industria farmacéutica la considera desatendida desde hace tiempo. Se cree que unas 20.000 personas en EE.UU. padecen una forma lo bastante grave de la enfermedad como para poder optar a un tratamiento como éste.

""Que la anemia falciforme se convierta de repente en el centro de este nuevo y espectacular enfoque del desarrollo terapéutico es, por un lado, estupendo, porque cabe esperar que revierta parte de esa historia de abandono y preste la atención que siempre ha necesitado la comunidad de la anemia falciforme"", afirma Megan Allyse, bioeticista de la Clínica Mayo. Sin embargo, señala que el acceso a un tratamiento tan avanzado sigue siendo una cuestión importante.

La primera ""enfermedad molecular""

Las bases de la anemia falciforme se conocen desde hace casi tres cuartos de siglo; en 1949, el químico Linus Pauling publicó un artículo en la revista Science en el que describía cómo la hemoglobina, proteína que transporta el oxígeno, es diferente en las personas con anemia falciforme, declarando esta dolencia la primera ""enfermedad molecular"".

Eso fue cuatro años antes de que se propusiera la famosa estructura doble helicoidal del ADN.

""Llevábamos esperándolo desde que se descubrió el ADN"", afirma el Dr. Lewis Hsu, jefe médico de la Asociación Estadounidense de Anemia Falciforme (Sickle Cell Disease Association of America) y médico que trata a niños con anemia falciforme. ""Ha tardado muchísimo en llegar"".

La anemia falciforme está causada por una mutación genética que hace que los glóbulos rojos, que contienen hemoglobina y transportan oxígeno por todo el cuerpo, estén deformados, como medias lunas u hoces. Estas células deformes pueden atascarse en los vasos sanguíneos, dañar los órganos y provocar episodios terribles de dolor que pueden durar días, denominados crisis vasooclusivas o de dolor.

""Me resultaba difícil hacer cosas como divertirme y demás, porque siempre tenía que estar preocupado por si iba a tener una crisis de dolor"", cuenta Johnny. El dolor ""me afectaba sobre todo a la parte baja de la espalda, y siempre era como un dolor punzante... Me dolía mucho"".

Hasta ahora, la única esperanza de curación para las personas con anemia falciforme era un trasplante de médula ósea o células madre. Pero Johnny, como más del 80% de los pacientes con anemia falciforme, no pudo encontrar un donante compatible.

Durante los 13 primeros años de su vida, Johnny tuvo que ser hospitalizado cada pocos meses por crisis de dolor y otras complicaciones de la enfermedad. Sus padres tenían que abastecerse de analgésicos opiáceos y siempre llevaban consigo una ""bolsa de viaje"" por si necesitaban ir al hospital con poca anticipación.

Pero desde octubre de 2021, cuando Johnny recibió una única infusión de sus propias células genéticamente modificadas, no ha vuelto a sufrir ninguna crisis.

""Ha sido como un niño normal"", dijo la madre de Johnny, Fabienne Desir. ""Nos ha cambiado la vida"".

Una nueva herramienta para editar genes

CRISPR es una técnica de edición de genes que permite a los científicos realizar cortes precisos en el ADN. El primer artículo científico sobre ella se publicó en 2012, y su desarrollo, por Jennifer Doudna y Emmanuelle Charpentier, ganó el Premio Nobel de Química solo ocho años después.

En el caso de la anemia falciforme, las células de los pacientes se extraen del cuerpo y se utiliza CRISPR para realizar una edición que vuelve a activar la producción de hemoglobina fetal, una forma de la proteína que los bebés producen en el útero. Una vez devueltas las células editadas, la hemoglobina fetal puede compensar la hemoglobina mutada que causa la anemia falciforme, explicó la Dra. Monica Bhatia, jefa de trasplante pediátrico de células madre del Centro Médico Irving de la Universidad de Columbia/Nueva York-Presbyterian, que ayudó a dirigir el ensayo en el que participó Johnny.

""Sabemos que la hemoglobina fetal tiene mayor capacidad de transporte de oxígeno que la hemoglobina adulta o la hemoglobina falciforme"", explica Bhatia.

Fabricar hemoglobina fetal junto con hemoglobina falciforme hace que un paciente sea similar a alguien con rasgo falciforme, explicó Bhatia; es decir, cuando alguien hereda un gen falciforme y otro normal, y ""no tiene ninguna de las complicaciones de la enfermedad"", dijo. ""Es más que suficiente"".

De hecho, el Dr. David Altshuler, director científico del fabricante de fármacos Vertex, señaló que algunas personas tienen de forma natural mutaciones genéticas que mantienen alta la hemoglobina fetal, ""y no tienen síntomas, aunque padezcan la afección"".

""Así que era como un enfoque fisiológico demostrado que funcionaría si se pudiera activar la [hemoglobina] fetal"", dijo.

Los resultados de los ensayos clínicos, incluido el de Johnny, lo confirman. En los datos citados por la FDA antes de una reunión de la comisión asesora sobre el tratamiento en octubre, 29 de los 30 pacientes alcanzaron el objetivo principal del ensayo: ausencia de crisis de dolor durante al menos 12 meses después del tratamiento. El periodo más largo sin crisis fue de 45,5 meses, casi cuatro años, y los investigadores continuarán el seguimiento de los pacientes.

La esperanza es que los efectos puedan durar toda la vida.

""No tenemos tantos datos a largo plazo como en el caso del trasplante de células madre"", afirma Bhatia. ""Pero esa sería la esperanza, que esto fuera comparable a un trasplante y que se mantuviera"".

Se esperaba que el segundo medicamento aprobado hoy, Lyfgenia, se aprobara pasadas unas semanas. Se trata de una tecnología más antigua, que utiliza un virus para administrar una copia sana del gen que produce la hemoglobina adulta para compensar la que produce la forma falciforme. También consiste en extraer las células del paciente de su cuerpo y luego devolvérselas. Los resultados son igualmente alentadores.

""Ambas técnicas aportan enormes beneficios a los pacientes"", declaró Andrew Obenshain, CEO de Bluebird.

Un precio de más de un millón de dólares

La cuestión clave es si la gente podrá costear y acceder a estos tratamientos. Los tratamientos genéticos únicos suelen costar más de un millón de dólares cada uno y requieren la infraestructura de grandes sistemas médicos.

""No sé si se cubrirán y pagarán"", afirma Hsu. Además, los centros médicos académicos que podrían ofrecer el tratamiento suelen estar en grandes ciudades.

""Yo estoy en Illinois, y básicamente se concentran en Chicago, lo que deja al resto del estado en una especie de vacío, por lo que la gente tendría que viajar una distancia muy larga para poder llegar a esto"", dijo. ""Y en algunos estados no hay nada"".

Y el tratamiento no es sencillo. Requiere muchos cuidados adicionales que incrementan el costo. Los pacientes suelen permanecer en el hospital alrededor de un mes para prepararse para la reinfusión de células modificadas genéticamente, pasando primero por lo que se conoce como ""acondicionamiento"": varios días de quimioterapia para eliminar su médula ósea, que produce células sanguíneas y plaquetas, de modo que estén preparados para recibir las nuevas células.

A continuación, ""esas células tardan un tiempo en instalarse en la médula ósea y crecer"", explica Bhatia.

El periodo que rodea a la infusión puede ser muy difícil para los pacientes y sus familias. La madre de Johnny describió cómo ""todo el tracto gastrointestinal de Johnny estaba inflamado; no podía tragar. Fue muy doloroso. Fue duro de ver"".

Hsu señaló que la quimioterapia conlleva riesgos, como la posibilidad de infertilidad. Señaló que existen métodos para intentar preservar la fertilidad antes del tratamiento, pero la cobertura para ello también puede variar según el estado. Y más de la mitad de las personas con anemia falciforme en EE.UU. dependen de Medicaid como seguro primario, según la organización Sick Cells.

El tratamiento de acondicionamiento también conlleva un riesgo potencial de cáncer. Dos pacientes de las primeras fases del ensayo de Bluebird murieron tras desarrollar leucemia, que se descubrió que no estaba relacionada con la terapia génica en sí, sino con la quimioterapia necesaria para prepararla.

Altshuler, de Vertex, dijo que su empresa está trabajando en la mejora del proceso de acondicionamiento para hacerlo menos agresivo, para ""crear la oportunidad de que las nuevas células entren sin ningún otro daño para el cuerpo"", aunque señaló que todavía está en fase de investigación.

Los científicos también están atentos a los posibles efectos no deseados del método de edición genética CRISPR, es decir, que el ADN se corte en un lugar no previsto, y la FDA convocó una reunión de un día entero en octubre para evaluar esos riesgos. Muchos de los expertos allí presentes expresaron su confianza en que esos riesgos eran ""relativamente pequeños"".

Para Altshuler, lo más importante de una aprobación de Casgevy es que exista un avance de este tipo para la anemia falciforme, no que sea la primera terapia CRISPR.

""No se trata de una herramienta, sino de la enfermedad"", afirma Altshuler. ""Una vez que encontramos la forma de entrar, y ahora que hemos demostrado que se puede tratar esta enfermedad de forma muy eficaz si se puede aumentar la [hemoglobina] fetal, vamos a impulsar esto"".

Según Altshuler, la empresa se encuentra en las primeras fases de investigación sobre cómo aumentar la hemoglobina fetal mediante una píldora, de modo que los pacientes no tengan que pasar por el proceso de acondicionamiento y edición genética.

Señaló que es muy pronto, pero dijo que ese tipo de enfoque podría ser la respuesta a la ""muy válida"" pregunta de ""¿cómo vamos a ayudar a la gente de todo el mundo con esta terapia?"".

La mayoría de los pacientes con anemia falciforme viven en África e India, y Obenshain, de Bluebird, dijo que la empresa no tiene planes de introducir allí ""esta versión"" de su terapia génica, señalando que es demasiado cara de fabricar.

""Básicamente, para cada paciente, fabricamos un lote de medicamento"", dijo Obenshain.

Para Johnny y su familia, los efectos de su tratamiento han sido tan transformadores que ahora celebran el día en que recibió la infusión de células modificadas genéticamente como su segundo cumpleaños. Puede ir a nadar sin miedo, una actividad que antes le provocaba una crisis de dolor, y pasó todo el verano pasado en la piscina, dice su familia.

Y aunque no obtuvo los superpoderes que le preocupaban, consiguió algo potencialmente aún mejor: la oportunidad de vivir una vida normal.

""Estoy empezando a enseñarle a conducir"", dice el padre de Johnny, JR Lubin.

632,¿Por qué puedes dormirte en el sofá pero después no concilias el sueño en la cama?,"¿Qué beneficios tiene para tu salud tomar una siesta? 2:35

Nota del editor: las opiniones expresadas en este comentario son exclusivamente de sus autores. CNN presenta el trabajo de The Conversation, una colaboración entre periodistas y académicos para ofrecer análisis de noticias. El contenido está producido exclusivamente por The Conversation.

(The Conversation) -- Después de un día largo, te dejas caer en el sofá y te quedas dormido viendo la tele. La habitación está calentita, el sofá es cómodo y el ruido de fondo de la tele te adormece.

Entonces un ser querido te da un codazo y te recuerda que tienes que irte a dormir a la cama. Pero cuando llegas, descubres con frustración que estás completamente despierto.

¿Por qué es tan fácil dormir en el sofá y no siempre en la cama?

¿Por qué es tan fácil dormirse en el sofá?

La presión del sueño es una de las razones por las que te duermes en el sofá. Esta se refiere a la fuerza del impulso biológico del sueño. Cuanto más tiempo lleves despierto, mayor será la presión del sueño.

publicidad

El reloj corporal o ritmo circadiano es otro factor. Este te indica que debes estar despierto durante el día y dormir por la noche.

El entorno también influye en las probabilidades de conciliar el sueño. Puede que recién hayas acabado de comer, que tu sofá cómodo este en una habitación cálida, con luz tenue, y quizá con un programa de televisión de fondo. Para muchas personas, este entorno es perfecto para conciliar el sueño.

Así que al final del día la presión del sueño es fuerte, tu ritmo circadiano te está diciendo que es hora de dormir y tu entorno es acogedor y cómodo.

¿Qué ocurre después de una siesta en el sofá?

Si te has echado una siesta en el sofá antes de irte a la cama, es probable que la presión del sueño sea mucho menor que antes de la siesta. En lugar de llevar más de 16 horas despierto, acabas de despertarte y, por lo tanto, tienes menos presión del sueño. Esto puede hacer que sea mucho más difícil conciliar el sueño en la cama.

Si te has quedado dormido en el sofá durante cinco minutos, es posible que no te cueste mucho conciliar el sueño en la cama. Es poco probable que una siesta tan corta reduzca mucho la presión del sueño. Pero si has dormido una hora, la cosa cambia.

Tus ciclos de sueño también pueden jugar en tu contra. La mayoría de los ciclos de sueño duran unos 90 minutos. Empiezan con un sueño ligero, pasan a un sueño profundo y terminan de nuevo con un sueño ligero. Si te despiertas durante el sueño profundo, es probable que te sientas aturdido y que te resulte fácil volver a dormirte cuando te acuestes. Pero si te despiertas durante el sueño ligero, podría ser más difícil volver a conciliar el sueño en la cama.

Las actividades que puedes hacer al levantarte del sofá —como encender luces brillantes o lavarte los dientes— también pueden hacer que te sientas más alerta y que te cueste más conciliar el sueño al llegar a la cama.

¿Por qué no puedo dormirme en mi cama?

Hay otras razones por las que conciliar el sueño en tu cama puede ser un reto. Muchas personas experimentan ansiedad a la hora de conciliar el sueño. Les preocupa dormir lo suficiente o quedarse dormidas lo bastante rápido.

En estos casos, meterse en la cama puede asociarse a sentimientos de estrés y aprensión, que dificultan aún más el sueño. Puede ser más fácil dormirse en el sofá, donde hay menos estrés.

También puede ser más difícil conciliar el sueño en la cama debido a una mala higiene del sueño. Esto se refiere a tu comportamiento antes de dormir y a tu entorno de sueño.

Una buena higiene del sueño, o hábitos de sueño saludables, incluye tener una rutina regular antes de acostarse, una habitación oscura y tranquila para dormir y no utilizar el teléfono móvil en la cama. Para muchas personas que no tienen una buena higiene del sueño, sus comportamientos antes de acostarse y el entorno de su dormitorio pueden no ser propicios para dormir.

¿Cómo puedo facilitar el sueño en la cama?

En primer lugar, asegúrate de que la habitación esté oscura, tranquila y cómoda. En invierno, puedes poner la calefacción 20 minutos antes de acostarte o llevarte una compresa caliente a la cama. En verano, puedes poner aire acondicionado o un ventilador para que la habitación sea cómoda para dormir.

Si te resulta fácil dormirte con la televisión encendida, puedes poner ""ruido blanco"" en tu dormitorio mientras te duermes. Algunas pruebas sugieren que esto puede facilitar el sueño al enmascarar otros ruidos molestos.

Tu comportamiento antes de acostarte también influye en la facilidad con la que te quedas dormido. Asegurarse de seguir la misma rutina todas las noches (incluso acostarse a la misma hora) puede ayudar.

Además, aunque te cueste, intenta no mirar el móvil mientras estás en la cama. Hacer scroll en el teléfono antes de acostarse puede dificultar el sueño debido tanto a la exposición a la luz azul como al efecto potencialmente estresante o de alerta del contenido con el que se interactúa.

En pocas palabras

La mejor manera de conciliar el sueño en la cama es evitar quedarse dormido en el sofá.

Así te asegurarás de que toda la presión del sueño que acumulas durante el día se dirija hacia un sueño profundo en la cama.

633,"La ""sucia"" verdad sobre quitarse los zapatos en la puerta de la casa","(CNN) -- Las fiestas navideñas en casa forman parte de la agenda de muchas personas, y aquellos anfitriones preocupados por los gérmenes se enfrentan a un dilema: ¿debo pedirles a mis invitados que se quiten los zapatos en la puerta, sobre todo si la reunión es de coctel o formal, o si la invitada es una adicta a los zapatos como Carrie Bradshaw?

En un episodio de ""Sex and the City"" de 2003, a Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) le piden que deje sus zapatos Manolo Blahnik de US$ 485 en la puerta durante una fiesta de bienvenida a un bebé en Nueva York organizada por su amiga Kyra (Tatum O'Neal) y pronto descubre que se los robaron.

""Ni siquiera le había dado una vuelta completa a la fiesta"", se lamenta Carrie más tarde en un almuerzo con sus amigas. El icónico personaje televisivo se vio obligado a volver a casa caminando con su vestido de fiesta y unos viejos tenis grises que le prestó la anfitriona.

""¿Por qué demonios te quitaste los zapatos?"", preguntó Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), amiga de Carrie.

""Tuvimos que hacerlo"", explicó Carrie. ""Por sus hijos, aparentemente arrastramos cosas en nuestros tacones que hacen enfermar a los niños"".

Aunque el episodio, ""A Woman’s Right to Shoes"", se diseñó para debatir los dilemas a los que se enfrentan las personas solteras en un mundo centrado en las familias con hijos, la cuestión subyacente —y el debate— en torno al calzado y la salud sigue vigente: ¿Existen pruebas significativas de que ir sin zapatos frena la propagación de gérmenes en un hogar?

""Por supuesto"", afirma Gabriel Filippelli, catedrático del departamento de Ciencias de la Tierra de la Universidad Indiana-Purdue de Indianápolis y director ejecutivo del Instituto de Resiliencia Medioambiental de la Universidad de Indiana.

""Podemos rastrear todo tipo de bacterias, pero sin duda algunas de las que más nos preocupan son las E. coli que causan calambres abdominales graves, diarrea sanguinolenta y vómitos"", explicó. ""Se han realizado estudios en los que se han tomado muestras de la suela de los zapatos y algo así como el 99% de los zapatos han dado positivo en material fecal"".

Metales pesados y más

Sin embargo, las bacterias no son el único peligro que acompaña al polvo y la suciedad que rodea las casas, jardines y parques rurales y urbanos, según Jill Litt, profesora de estudios medioambientales de la Universidad de Colorado en Boulder, que actualmente trabaja como investigadora principal en el Instituto de Salud Global de Barcelona, o ISGlobal, en España.

""Los estudios han demostrado que en las zonas urbanas donde hay casas antiguas, el plomo del polvo puede llegar a la casa a través de la superficie de los zapatos"", dijo. ""Otros estudios han demostrado que se pueden traer residuos de pesticidas de los jardines a través de los zapatos"".

Metales pesados como el plomo, el cobre y el zinc impregnan los suelos de parques y calles urbanas por décadas de contaminantes, mientras que los niveles de pesticidas pueden ser elevados en zonas agrícolas rurales, añadió Litt.

Las casas construidas antes de 1978 tienen muchas probabilidades de contener pintura con plomo, que puede desconcharse, descascararse y desintegrarse en polvo peligroso, dicen los expertos. No existe un nivel seguro de plomo a ninguna edad, pero los niños son especialmente vulnerables a los efectos tóxicos de los metales pesados y los pesticidas debido a su pequeño tamaño y a su proximidad a los contaminantes cuando gatean, ruedan y juegan por el suelo de la casa.

""Para los más pequeños, el contacto directo con las manos es una de las principales vías de exposición a sustancias tóxicas y agentes de enfermedades infecciosas"", afirma Litt, que también dirige Reimagining Environments for Connection and Engagement: Testing Actions for Social Prescribing in Natural Spaces. Financiado por la Unión Europea, el proyecto pretende combatir la soledad con espacios naturales.

Pasa primero el trapeador

Antes de pedir a la gente que se quite los zapatos, asegúrate de que la casa está lo más libre de polvo posible, dicen los expertos. Nunca aspires ni barras primero con una escoba, ya que sólo conseguirás remover todas las toxinas y transportarlas por el aire. En su lugar, utiliza un trapeador húmedo o en spray. Aunque resulte contraintuitivo añadir agua a la suciedad, en realidad es la mejor forma de eliminar las toxinas, afirma Litt.

Lo mismo se aplica a cualquier superficie horizontal, dice Filippelli, pero mantente alejado de los plumeros. ""Limpia con más regularidad las superficies horizontales con un paño húmedo, es decir, alféizares, mesas, mesas de centro, fondos de sillas, asientos de sillas y otros muebles, además del suelo"".

Utiliza el método de las ""tres cubetas"" si vives en una casa antigua con pintura de plomo o en una zona con altos niveles de plomo en el exterior. Ten preparada una cubeta con una solución limpiadora multiusos, otra para aclarar y una vacía.

""Algunas personas también utilizan una solución muy débil de vinagre en el agua de lavado, que funciona muy bien"", dijo Filippelli. ""Hay algunos superesterilizantes en el mercado, pero cuando los limpiadores son realmente buenos para matar bacterias, no suelen ser muy buenos para nosotros como seres humanos. Siempre que algo desprenda un olor superfuerte, hay que pensárselo al menos dos veces"".

Sumerge el trapeador en la solución limpiadora, escurre el exceso de agua en la cubeta vacía y empieza a fregar, empezando por el punto más alejado de la puerta. Trabaja hacia la puerta, utilizando el agua limpia como aclarado a medida que avanzas. Tira el agua en el inodoro cuando parezca sucia o con cada nueva habitación, no la tires fuera.

""La mayor concentración de gérmenes se encuentra en la entrada interior, y los niveles descienden a medida que nos alejamos de esta zona"", explica Litt. ""Las moquetas retienen mucho polvo, por lo que sería una de las cosas que eliminaría si le preocupa el polvo y los posibles problemas de salud"".

Las zonas alfombradas deben aspirarse con un aparato que tenga un filtro de partículas de aire de alta eficacia, o HEPA, no con aspiradoras sin bolsa, y tirar la bolsa o el filtro en un bote de basura exterior al terminar.

Piensa en la comodidad de tus invitados

Quitarse los zapatos en la puerta puede ser la mejor manera de limitar la entrada de gérmenes y polvo potencialmente tóxico, pero eso no significa que no debas pensar en la comodidad de tus invitados, dice Filippelli. Proporcionar zapatillas lavables o calcetines antideslizantes puede ser un gesto considerado.

""No me gusta andar con los pies descalzos por dentro, así que éste es mi truco. Tengo unas zapatillas calentitas en la puerta de casa; muchas otras culturas también lo hacen"", explica.

""En cualquier hogar asiático, o incluso de Oriente Medio, suele haber un pequeño cubículo justo dentro de la puerta con zapatillas lavables. Tienes que quitarte los zapatos, coger las zapatillas y ponértelas"".

¿Habría resuelto eso los problemas de Carrie de quitarse los zapatos? No, esos se solucionaron cuando le pidió a Kyra que comprara unos Manolo nuevos como regalo por la inminente boda de Carrie... con ella misma.

""¿Eso es todo lo que le pidió?"", le preguntó Kyra a la dependienta, mientras sus hijos correteaban por la ostentosa tienda Manolo Blahnik de Madison Avenue.","['sucia', 'que', 'y', 'las', 'el', 'la', 'una', 'quitarse', 'puerta', 'en', 'los', 'se', 'sobre', 'verdad', 'zapatos', 'casa']","""Se han realizado estudios en los que se han tomado muestras de la suela de los zapatos y algo así como el 99% de los zapatos han dado positivo en material fecal"".

634,La isla paradisíaca de US$ 1.000 la noche que guarda un delicioso secreto,"(Crédito: Blue Safari Seychelles)

(CNN) -- A primera vista, la isla Alphonse de las Seychelles es el arquetipo de escapada a una isla desierta: playas de arena blanca rodeadas de palmeras, cálidas aguas azules, arrecifes de coral y bancos de arena repletos de vida marina.



Si a esto le añadimos un hotel de lujo con impresionantes bungalows de playa que cuestan más de US$ 1.000 la noche, podríamos pensar que se trata de un destino que se deleita con su aire enrarecido.

Sin embargo, esta isla privada de las Islas Exteriores de las Seychelles, a unos 400 kilómetros al suroeste por el océano Índico desde la isla principal de Mahé, alberga en realidad un proyecto de sostenibilidad pionero y de gran alcance.

Keith Rose-Innes está al frente del proyecto de sostenibilidad de la isla Alphonse. Como director de la isla, ha supervisado una transformación que sitúa las prácticas respetuosas con el medio ambiente en su centro, entre ellas ""The Farm"".

Este proyecto abastece de frutas y verduras de cultivo ecológico a los restaurantes de la isla, así como a otras propiedades de Blue Safaris en los atolones de Astove, Cosmoledo, Farquhar y Poivre. El objetivo, explica Rose-Innes, es recortar los kilómetros recorridos por los alimentos y, de paso, reducir las emisiones de carbono.

""Llevar los productos por avión no es sostenible"", afirma. La otra opción es traer los productos en barco, lo que puede llevar dos días y es muy contaminante.

publicidad

""Solo tomamos una barcaza cada dos meses, lo que significa que realmente solo podemos traer frutas y verduras pesadas cada dos meses"".

Un gran cambio

Según el Banco Mundial, en 2021 las Seychelles importaron verduras de la India, Emiratos Árabes Unidos, Portugal, Túnez y Turquía. El 90% de los alimentos que se consumen en las islas se importan del extranjero.

Sin embargo, Rose-Innes afirma que él y su equipo en la isla Alphonse han conseguido equilibrar la balanza, al menos en el grupo Blue Safaris.

""Desde el punto de vista de la sostenibilidad, es un cambio enorme para nosotros. Toda la fruta y la verdura que no utilizamos puede volver directamente a la tierra y, obviamente, tenemos productos frescos, así que es mucho más fácil desde el punto de vista de la sostenibilidad, pero también desde el punto de vista del servicio. La calidad es mucho mayor"".

Según explica, The Farm sigue un calendario estacional y cultiva desde plátanos, higos, limas y melones hasta remolachas o betabeles, pepinos, calabazas y coles chinas.

Ha sido un proceso difícil que ha implicado muchas pruebas y errores. Con la sal en el suelo a solo 30 centímetros de profundidad, Rose-Innes y los agricultores de la isla Alphonse han tenido que elaborar planes para cultivar productos que no solo sobrevivan, sino que prosperen.

The Farm de la isla Alphonse cultiva actualmente 27,6 toneladas de frutas, verduras y hierbas al año, con una producción media mensual de 2,3 toneladas. Se trata de un sistema cerrado, en el que todo lo que no se come se utiliza como abono para ayudar a cultivar el siguiente lote de productos.

Rose-Innes explica que una nueva remodelación ha ayudado a llevar las cosas al siguiente nivel.

""Con la ayuda de asesores, instalamos túneles totalmente sombreados, túneles con un 20% de sombra y túneles con un 40% de sombra. Tenemos camas de siembra, bandejas de siembra y túneles de siembra, sistemas de riego automatizados y diferentes regímenes de plantación"".

También ha contratado a un experto en microgreens de Sudáfrica, capaz de producir diferentes plantas para complementar y dar vida a los platillos cada día.

""Hacemos auditorías apropiadas de cuándo plantar y nos aseguramos de que haya continuidad de todas las frutas y verduras lo mejor posible a lo largo de la temporada"", dice Rose-Innes.

El resultado es que Alphonse Island cultiva ahora alrededor del 75% de sus propios productos, lo que reduce enormemente la necesidad de importaciones.

Más sostenibilidad

Gracias a esta iniciativa, la isla Alphonse se ha convertido en finalista de la edición inaugural de los premios Star Sustainability Initiative Awards 2023, una nueva categoría de los prestigiosos premios Travel Bulletin Star Awards, que celebran su 25ª edición.

Sin embargo, Rose-Innes quiere ir más allá. Tiene la estricta norma de no importar agua mineral a la isla por lo que no llegan botellas de plástico de un solo uso que puedan contaminar. El agua dulce se desaliniza o se bombea de los tejados tras las lluvias y se lleva a una bomba central para regar la granja. Más de 2.000 paneles solares proporcionan el 80% de la energía de la isla.

Mientras tanto, todos los peces se pescan con sedal en aguas profundas, en el extremo más alejado del arrecife de coral de la isla Alphonse.

""No compramos pescado de ningún lugar del mundo. Creemos en la pesca sostenible, así que pescamos lejos del arrecife, lejos de las zonas de buceo, en aguas profundas, especies de peces que sabemos que abundan"", afirma.

Servir pescado capturado con redes o redes de arrastre, ""desvirtúa el propósito del negocio"", añade.

Esto va más allá de la comida y la energía. La isla cuenta con un equipo de científicos y conservacionistas dedicados a cuidar y preservar las frágiles aguas y los arenales que hacen que la ecología de este lugar sea tan fascinante.

""Cada huésped que viene a la isla dona 30 dólares por persona y día a la fundación independiente creada para proteger estos destinos. Nos dictan los científicos y la ciencia que se desprende de su trabajo. Así que todo, desde las actividades que hacemos en las llanuras hasta cómo podemos ser responsables, está controlado"".

Estos científicos, de la Island Conservation Society, conocen a fondo la isla y su fauna, y ayudan a Rose-Innes y su personal a tomar las mejores decisiones para la zona.

Un entorno prístino

Rose-Innes llegó a las Seychelles hace 25 años, al principio como guía de pesca con mosca. Se enamoró de su belleza y su naturaleza virgen. La llegada de los hoteles y el turismo ha contribuido a impulsar la economía local, pero, dice, corresponde al sector hotelero mantener las maravillas naturales de las islas.

""Si paseas por las llanuras, si observas las rayas, los tiburones en los bajíos, miras todos los microorganismos, vas a un safari de delfines o de mantarrayas, está lleno de acción. Hay muchas actividades diferentes que son únicas para nosotros, porque el entorno, desde una perspectiva submarina, es lo más prístino que conocerás"".

""Si caminas por la playa, verás 40 o 50 tortugas carey nadando. Anidan todas las noches, salen de la playa, incuban todo el tiempo. Así que realmente es un destino único, no es un destino falso"".

Es comprensible que exista una creciente preocupación por el equilibrio entre el turismo y una crisis medioambiental que se agudiza rápidamente y afecta de forma desproporcionada a las comunidades de países como las Seychelles.

Rose-Innes cree que es posible alcanzar ese equilibrio.

""Si nosotros podemos hacerlo, cualquiera puede"", afirma. ""Es mucho más fácil ser responsable en tierra o más cerca de una isla principal. Si somos capaces de ser responsables en estos destinos, estaremos dando ejemplo. Se puede ser responsable en cualquier sitio. Todo se trata de forma sostenible. Por desgracia, es mucho más caro hacerlo así, pero es la forma correcta de hacerlo"".","['que', 'noche', 'y', '1000', 'secreto', 'las', 'el', 'guarda', 'la', 'delicioso', 'en', 'se', 'los', 'es', 'isla', 'paradisíaca']","Si a esto le añadimos un hotel de lujo con impresionantes bungalows de playa que cuestan más de US$ 1.000 la noche, podríamos pensar que se trata de un destino que se deleita con su aire enrarecido.

635,Se enamoraron en lados opuestos del mundo y ahora planean su boda,"Sebastian Fuchs y Denise Sung se conocieron por casualidad en un bar de Hong Kong hace ocho años. (Foto: Denise Sung)

(CNN) — Cuando Denise Sung crecía en Taiwán, soñaba con conocer a un hombre llamado Sebastian.

Todo empezó cuando leyó la obra de William Shakespeare “Twelfth Night” (Noche de reyes), una comedia romántica en la que uno de los protagonistas se llama Sebastián. La joven Denise se dejó llevar por la historia de Shakespeare sobre naufragios, identidades equivocadas y romance, y la obra se quedó con ella, pero sobre todo fue por el nombre de Sebastian.

""Pensé: 'Sebastian es un nombre tan hermoso'"", cuenta Denise a CNN Travel. “Me enamoré de ese nombre”.

En ese momento, Denise nunca había conocido a nadie llamado Sebastian. Y luego pasó toda su adolescencia y la mitad de sus 20 sin encontrar el nombre en la vida real.

Hasta que, a los 26 años, Denise Sung conoció a Sebastian Fuchs.

Denise había pasado su vida adulta viviendo en todo el mundo, saltando de Taiwán a Estados Unidos, de Australia a China. El resultado fueron amigos cercanos repartidos en todo el mundo, y en el verano de 2015, uno de ellos (un buen amigo de la época universitaria de Denise en Sydney) se iba a casar en Hong Kong y le pidió que fuera una de sus damas de honor.

“Siempre les decía a mis amigos: 'Estamos a solo un vuelo de distancia. Si realmente quieres ponerte al día, si hay algún evento importante en tu vida, estoy literalmente a un boleto de avión de distancia. Siempre puedo estar ahí para ti'”, dice Denise.

Entonces, fiel a su palabra, Denise reservó un vuelo a Hong Kong para la boda de su amiga. Cuando llegó, se sumió en las festividades y luego, en el último minuto, decidió extender su viaje hasta el siguiente fin de semana para poder pasar más tiempo con sus amigos.

Una noche, después de la boda, Denise y dos de sus amigas fueron al distrito Lan Kwai Fong de Hong Kong.

“LKF es un barrio de fiesta”, explica Denise. ""Vas allí cualquier día de la semana y siempre pasa algo: hay bares, restaurantes, está justo en el centro de Hong Kong, para que no te lo pierdas. Sobre todo cuando eres joven, ahí es donde vas"".

Denise y sus amigas pasaron la noche entrando y saliendo de bares antes de terminar en uno llamado shisha.

“Si me preguntas cómo se llamaba el bar, realmente no lo recuerdo”, dice Denise, riendo. ""Había mucho alcohol"".

En el bar de shisha, Denise y sus amigas estaban sentadas en un rincón, metidas en una conversación. El bar era bastante pequeño y los distintos grupos estaban amontonados, así que cuando dos chicos en una mesa cercana se dieron vuelta y comenzaron a hablar con Denise y su grupo, no fue una sorpresa.

Ellos explicaron que eran de Alemania y estaban de vacaciones en Hong Kong. Luego se presentaron y ese fue el momento en que Denise conoció a Sebastian.

“Ese es mi nombre favorito”, exclamó Denise, sin pensar.

En 2015, Sebastian realizaba un posdoctorado en Suiza. Estaba de vacaciones en Hong Kong con un amigo de su época de doctorado en Frankfurt, Alemania. El día que conoció a Denise resultó ser su cumpleaños número 31.

""Celebramos mi cumpleaños en un bar y luego nos encontramos con Denise y dos de sus amigas"", relata Sebastian a CNN Travel.

Sebastian y su amigo se llevaron bien de inmediato con Denise y sus amigas. Hablaron de sus experiencias en Hong Kong y de cómo habían llegado allí. El amigo de Sebastian lideró la conversación – “es una persona muy tranquila y extrovertida – pero mientras Sebastian estaba más tranquilo, para Denise era magnético.

""Ciertamente hubo atracción a primera vista"", cuenta.

“Puedo decir sin lugar a dudas que Denise también me causó una muy buena primera impresión”, coincide Sebastian.

Pero en aquel entonces, Sebastian buscaba, ante todo, “estabilidad” en una relación.

Y si bien Denise le gustó de inmediato, no se le ocurrió que ella podría ser la persona que se lo ofrecería, simplemente “por el hecho de que nos conocimos tan lejos de casa”, dice.

En cuanto a Denise, era una romántica que creía firmemente “que hay un próximo gran amor a la vuelta de la esquina”.

“Cuando tenía 20 años era bastante extrovertida, siempre salía y me encantaba conocer gente nueva”, añade Denise.

Pero antes de conocer a Sebastian, Denise sentía que realmente nunca había tenido una relación romántica ""significativa"". Y de inmediato, algo en él pareció diferente.

Incluso esa primera noche, para Denise, conocer a Sebastian se sintió un poco como el destino: ella no tenía intención de estar en Hong Kong ese fin de semana y resultó que él tampoco. Sebastian y su amigo habían planeado originalmente ir a Bangkok, Tailandia, pero cambiaron de planes en el último momento. Denise también pensó que el hecho de que se conocieran en el cumpleaños de Sebastian fue ""realmente genial"". Por supuesto, estaba todo el asunto del nombre.

Y eso no fue todo, Sebastian y su amigo se alojaban en el mismo hotel que Denise.

“De todos los hoteles de Hong Kong, Sebastian y yo reservamos en el mismo hotel”, dice Denise.

No pudo evitar sentir que los habían “puesto en el mismo lugar al mismo tiempo”, contra todo pronóstico.

Sebastian es un pensador más lógico que Denise. Pero aún así se dejó llevar por la emoción de la noche y se encontró actuando fuera de lugar. Cuando Denise le preguntó si quería fumar un cigarrillo, dijo que sí.

""Hasta ese momento, nunca había fumado en mi vida"", revela. “Después de ese momento, tampoco volví a fumar un cigarrillo. Pero en ese momento, por alguna razón, no me atrevía a decir que no”.

Mantenerse en contacto

Sebastian y Denise abandonaron Hong Kong con los datos de contacto de cada uno guardados, pero sin planes de volver a verse.

Sin pensar realmente en ello, ni hacer ningún esfuerzo consciente, se mantuvieron en contacto: “simplemente enviando mensajes de texto y hablando constantemente”, describe Denise.

Pasó un año entero antes de que Denise y Sebastian se volvieran a encontrar. En el verano de 2016, Denise y una amiga reservaron un viaje a Europa y planeaban viajar a varios destinos. De pasada, Sebastian mencionó que estaría en Alemania durante ese período, por lo que Denise decidió incluir a Frankfurt en su itinerario.

Si bien Denise era extrovertida por naturaleza, esta decisión estaba fuera de lugar, al menos en lo que respecta a su vida romántica.

“Cuando tenía poco más de 20 años, siempre tuve mucho miedo de exponerme y pensaba demasiado. Se podría decir que no me sentía muy cómoda conmigo misma, siempre preocupándome por lo que la gente pensara de mí”, dice.

“Cuando tenía veintitantos años, mi mentalidad realmente cambió. Pensé: '¿Qué puedo perder? Tengo muchas ganas de conocer a este chico’. Así que me fui a Frankfurt”.

Denise y Sebastian se reunieron en Frankfurt y luego viajaron a Munich. También visitaron la ciudad natal de Sebastian, donde Denise conoció a su hermana.

Pasar tiempo juntos en Alemania fue fácil y divertido.

Para Denise, fue el hecho de que Sebastian era “honesto y muy sincero”.

En cuanto a Sebastian, disfrutó mostrarle a Denise su país de origen y verla en Alemania hizo que su conexión pareciera más real.

“Definitivamente fue muy emocionante reencontrarme con ella, después de aquellas vacaciones, ahora en mi día a día real”, detalla.

Comprometiéndose el uno con el otro

Un año después, en el verano de 2017, Sebastian visitó a Denise en California, Estados Unidos, donde ella vivía y trabajaba.

Fue entonces cuando Denise le dijo a Sebastian que estaba comprometida con él y con hacer que la larga distancia funcionara, a largo plazo.

Denise se esforzaba por comprender esta mentalidad.

“Le conté a mi abuela sobre ti”, dijo. “¿Y ahora estás diciendo que esto no va a ninguna parte? Necesitas tomar una decisión”.

Sebastian no quería estar con nadie más. Simplemente le preocupaba la realidad de las citas entre continentes sin un final a la vista. Pero Denise le aseguró que lo harían funcionar.

“Simplemente siento que, tal vez debido a mi educación, siempre estoy en un país diferente lejos de alguien”, relata Denise. “Y yo sí lo creo. Si conoces a alguien que es adecuado y significativo para ti, todo lo demás eventualmente saldrá bien”.

La certeza de Denise ayudó a calmar la incertidumbre de Sebastian. Estuvo de acuerdo en que también quería intentar que su relación funcionara. Mirando hacia atrás, Denise está orgullosa de cómo manejó este momento.

“Como feminista orgullosa, creo que en los tiempos modernos no hay razón para que los hombres sean quienes inicien las cosas”, afirma. “Estaba muy segura de que le gustaba. De lo contrario, estaría saliendo con otra persona, pero sé que no estaba saliendo con nadie más. Así que supe que esto era serio, él lo es, pero simplemente no estaba seguro de cómo iba a funcionar”.

Denise y Sebastian decidieron que en el futuro se asegurarían de tener reuniones programadas periódicamente. Se comprometieron a verse al menos cada dos meses.

A partir de entonces, se encontraron en todo el mundo y cada vez fueron más cercanos.

""A ambos nos encanta viajar"", dice Denise. “Elegiríamos una ciudad y pasaríamos nuestro tiempo allí juntos. Me convertí en un experto en aprender a acumular puntos de aerolíneas”.

La larga distancia se hizo más fácil gracias al trabajo de Sebastian, que le brindó muchos días de vacaciones, así como oportunidades de viajar a Estados Unidos.

“Estas circunstancias nos ayudaron a vernos mucho, algo que quizás algunas personas no puedan hacer”, explica.

Aún así, tanto Sebastian como Denise tenían amigos que se oponían a la situación.

“Escuchaba: '¿Cómo puede ser una relación real si no viven juntos?'”, recuerda Denise. “Pero son solo las perspectivas de la gente. Para alguien que nunca ha tenido una relación a larga distancia, es alguien que está acostumbrado a tener otra persona contigo las 24 horas del día, los 7 días de la semana. Y creen que así debería ser una relación”.

Pero Denise y Sebastian estaban, como dice Denise, ""haciendo sus propias reglas"". Ambos tienen una fuerte voluntad y un fuerte sentido de sí mismos que aportaron a su asociación.

""Siempre he pensado: 'Quiero seguir mi propio camino, tomar mis propias decisiones, lo que es correcto para mí'"", dice Sebastian.

""Me quiero mucho. Así que en cada decisión que tomo siempre me pongo a mí primero, por ejemplo, qué me hace más feliz, cuál es la forma más saludable para mí, personal y mentalmente”, añade Denise.

Durante este período, tanto Sebastián como Denise dieron pasos adelante en sus respectivas carreras y obtuvieron éxitos que atribuyen, en parte, al apoyo del otro.

""Siempre he pensado: 'Quiero seguir mi propio camino, tomar mis propias decisiones, lo que es bueno para mí'"", dice Sebastian.

""Me quiero mucho a mí misma. Por eso, cada decisión que tomo siempre la antepongo a mí misma: lo que me hace más feliz, lo que es más sano para mí, personal y mentalmente"", añade Denise.

En este tiempo, tanto Sebastian como Denise avanzaron en sus respectivas carreras y cosecharon éxitos que atribuyen, en parte, al apoyo del otro.

Separación inesperada

En 2019, Denise y Sebastian dieron otro paso adelante: Denise presentó a Sebastian a sus padres.

""Vengo de una familia china taiwanesa bastante conservadora y tradicional, así que, culturalmente hablando, mis padres son tradicionales en el sentido de que piensan: 'No me presentes a ninguno de tus novios, a menos que se trate de alguien con quien estés preparada para casarte'"", cuenta Denise.

Cuando sus padres conocieron a Sebastian, ""lo adoraron"", dice Denise. Fue a finales de 2019. La pareja se quedó en Asia hasta 2020 para celebrar el Año Nuevo Lunar a finales de enero.

Fue en ese entonces cuando Denise y Sebastian escucharon por primera vez rumores de la pandemia. Pero cuando se despidieron en enero y volaron de regreso a sus respectivos hogares, supusieron que podrían reunirse en Estados Unidos en marzo, como habían planeado.

Pero justo antes de la fecha de partida de Sebastian, las fronteras estadounidenses se cerraron.

""Tuvo que cancelar sus vuelos. Y fue entonces cuando no supimos cuándo volveríamos a vernos"", cuenta Denise.

De repente, la actitud de ""sólo falta un boleto de avión"" con la que Denise había crecido se desmoronó a su alrededor.

""Ése fue el mayor reto, porque esto está fuera de tu control"", dice.

Durante los meses de separación que siguieron, Denise pensó en sus abuelos. Abandonaron China durante la guerra civil y se fueron a Taiwán.

""No pudieron volver en 15 años, no podían volver a China a visitar a sus conocidos y familia"", dice Denise. ""Recuerdo que de niña había oído hablar de esta historia y le dije a mi madre: '¿Cómo es posible?"".

Aunque se trataba de una situación muy diferente, Denise comprendió por primera vez que la posibilidad de viajar por todo el mundo para ver a Sebastian no estaba garantizada.

""Te hace sentir que viajar se convierte en un privilegio; antes no lo tomábamos como un privilegio"", dice.

Mientras la pandemia se extendía por el mundo y las fronteras se cerraban, Denise y Sebastian se mantenían en contacto constantemente, con videollamadas y mensajes. Y, con el tiempo, empezaron a hablar de matrimonio.

Antes de 2020, el matrimonio no había estado en el radar de Denise, pero la combinación de echar de menos a Sebastian y darse cuenta de que si se hubieran casado, habrían podido reunirse más fácilmente, le hizo considerar seriamente la perspectiva por primera vez.

Denise y Sebastian estuvieron separados casi dos años. Durante ese tiempo oscilaron entre la tristeza, la rabia, la frustración y el alivio de que su situación no fuera peor. Estaban agradecidos por estar sanos y tener trabajos estables, y aunque no podían estar juntos, habían oído historias en internet de otras parejas internacionales separadas en situaciones mucho peores: personas que no habían conocido a sus hijos, personas con parejas en otros países que estaban gravemente enfermas.

Pero Denise y Sebastian seguían luchando por estar separados y por no saber qué les depararía el futuro.

Denise se distrajo adoptando un perro de rescate, una decisión que describe como ""la mejor que he tomado"". Hizo nuevos amigos en el parque canino, amigos que bromeaban diciendo que podría haberse inventado a Sebastian por completo, ya que nunca lo habían conocido.

Sebastian dedicó gran parte de su energía al trabajo. En sus ratos libres, jugaba al baloncesto con amigos de la zona, que le ayudaban a olvidarse de extrañar a Denise.

""Cosas así me ayudaron mucho a sobrellevarlo, pero sin duda estaba deseando encontrarme con Denise lo antes posible"", dice Sebastian. ""Y lo intentamos todo"".

Sebastian y Denise finalmente se reunieron a finales de 2021 en México.

""Fue un gran alivio volver a ver a Denise"", dice Sebastian.

Ambos estaban encantados de volver a verse. Pero, según Denise, no fue un reencuentro tan dramático como podría imaginarse. Al contrario, fue como si no hubiera pasado el tiempo, y volvieron fácilmente a su dinámica.

""Con él, siempre me siento muy contenta. No hay una montaña rusa de emociones"", dice Denise. ""Estoy muy contenta con él y me siento como en casa cuando estoy con él. Es muy importante para mí, porque me fui de casa muy joven. Pero con él, siento que éste es mi hogar"".

Sebastian le propuso matrimonio a Denise en México. Estaban sentados en una cabaña junto a la playa cuando se volvió hacia Denise.

""Quiero pasar el resto de mi vida contigo"", le dijo.

Aunque la pareja deseaba casarse lo antes posible, también querían que sus seres queridos estuvieran allí para celebrarlo con ellos, así que se dieron cuenta de que tendrían que esperar: los padres de Denise viven actualmente en China, donde las restricciones de viaje por la pandemia no se levantaron hasta el pasado agosto.

Una vez que se disipó la incertidumbre de covid, Denise y Sebastian pudieron por fin fijar la fecha de su boda: primavera de 2024 en el hotel de lujo Schlosshotel Kronberg, a las afueras de Frankfurt.

Están deseando celebrarlo con familiares y amigos de todo el mundo. A Denise le hace especial ilusión presentar Alemania a sus seres queridos.

""Quería aprovechar esta oportunidad para enseñarles el país que pronto llamaré 'mi segundo hogar'"", dice.

Mirando al futuro

Denise y Sebastian no saben exactamente qué les deparará el futuro ni dónde se instalarán, pero les entusiasman las perspectivas.

""Quiero elegir un lugar que sea diverso"", dice Denise. ""Si tenemos hijos, quiero que mis hijos entiendan con fluidez todas sus diferentes culturas: americana, alemana y china"".

A Denise y a Sebastian les gusta conocer la cultura del otro. A lo largo de los años, a veces se han encontrado con grandes diferencias de perspectiva, pero afrontan estos momentos con una apertura de mente y una curiosidad compartidas.

""Nuestra forma de enfocar las cosas puede ser muy diferente. Pero creo que eso es algo que siempre podemos aprender el uno del otro y comprender"", dice Denise. ""Ambos respetamos por igual la cultura del otro y tenemos la misma curiosidad por aprender sobre la cultura del otro"".

""Eso es algo que realmente nos une y que tenemos en común"", coincide Sebastian. ""La diferencia cultural nunca ha sido algo que me disuada, más bien es algo que me atrae"".

Hace ya ocho años que Sebastian y Denise se cruzaron en el bar de Hong Kong. Hoy, Sebastian pasa más tiempo mirando hacia delante que reflexionando sobre tiempos pasados.

""No pienso en lo improbable que fue que nos conociéramos"", dice. ""Simplemente me alegro de que sucediera y espero con ilusión el futuro que tenemos juntos"".

Denise también está ilusionada con ese futuro, pero sigue impresionada por lo improbable de su encuentro y cree que estaba destinado a suceder.

""Creo en la energía del universo"", dice Denise. ""En chino tenemos una palabra, 'yuánfèn', que básicamente significa 'destino'. A menudo usamos esa palabra cuando ves a gente de lados completamente distintos del mundo acercándose"".

""Él es de Frankfurt. Yo crecí en el campo, en Taiwán. Estábamos en países distintos. Y nos conocimos en un tercer país en el que ambos no esperaríamos estar en ese lugar, en ese momento. Empiezas a preguntarte. Te preguntas, si no es el destino, ¿qué es? Y dio la casualidad de que tenía mi nombre de chico favorito. Quizá siempre supe que me casaría con Sebastian"".","['sebastian', 'que', 'mundo', 'y', 'lados', 'denise', 'planean', 'su', 'el', 'la', 'del', 'una', 'se', 'en', 'opuestos', 'por', 'enamoraron']","Y luego pasó toda su adolescencia y la mitad de sus 20 sin encontrar el nombre en la vida real.

(CNN Español) –– Mas allá de sus ""gordos"", sus enormes frutas, sus músicos, sus mujeres voluptuosas y sus paisajes colombianos, el pintor y escultor colombiano Fernando Botero, que falleció el 15 de septiembre de 2023, fue una de las figuras más prominentes del arte internacional y un orgullo para todos. Mari Rodríguez Ichaso habló con él en 2020. Esta fue la entrevista:

Fernando Botero es un gran ejemplo de que se puede triunfar cuando se cree en sí mismo. Lo que llevó a un chico de escasos medios económicos de Medellín a seguir su vocación, a saber lo que quería hacer en su vida y, en el camino, ser uno de los artistas más famosos.

He tenido la suerte de que Fernando Botero ha sido por muchos años un buen amigo. Siempre digo que es el hombre más seguro de sí mismo que haya conocido. También que Botero siempre me haya hablado con sencillez de sus comienzos en Medellín. Haciéndolo con la satisfacción de quien demostró que estaban equivocados los que le decían ""Botero, ¿por qué no pinta en los fines de semana y se busca un trabajo de verdad?"". Sí, aquello sucedió en los comienzos, cuando intentaba vivir de su arte, y es una anécdota agridulce que hace reír y que siempre cuenta, incluso con cariño.

¿Y cómo es Fernando Botero?, muchos me preguntan. Pues es un hombre amable, sereno y seguro, y esa seguridad la trae su carácter afable, su sentido del humor y su gran perseverancia. Un hombre que, en el tope de su carrera, sabe disfrutar con sibaritismo la vida, incluyendo su fama y fortuna.

Fama y fortuna que comparte, mayormente en Mónaco, con su tercera esposa, la famosa escultora Sophia Vari, de origen grecofrancés, que lo acompaña desde hace muchos años y con quien tiene una excelente relación. Su vida ha sido por décadas la de un verdadero ""hombre renacentista"" del siglo XXI, con casas en París; Pietrasanta, Italia (donde hace sus monumentales esculturas), Bogotá, Mónaco y Nueva York, donde todo lo disfruta con una sonrisa amable y una serenidad muy a su estilo Botero.

Nacido el 19 de abril de 1932 en una buena familia en Medellín, su madre y hermanos tuvieron problemas económicos después de que murió su padre, lo que dejó a los Botero Angulo en una situación difícil. A los 12 años, su tío lo inscribió en una escuela de toreros, donde estudió y comenzó su amor por la tauromaquia, la que ha pintado a menudo. Y sobre toros vende su primera obra, lo que me cuenta con mucha gracia. ""La primera obra que vendí fue una de toros. En Medellín, se vendían las boletas de las corridas en el almacén de Rafael Pérez, él ponía mis acuarelas de toros en la vitrina y alguien compró una por dos pesos. Aquella venta me produjo una gran emoción y me fui corriendo a mi casa a mostrarles a mis hermanos que había vendido un cuadro, y en el camino se me perdieron los dos pesos porque tenía roto el bolsillo del pantalón"". ¡Un comienzo tragicómico que parece pertenecer a uno de los personajes de sus famosos cuadros!

¿Una nota antes de presentarles nuestra entrevista? Los ""gordos"" de Botero ––que él prefiere llamar ""formas rotundas"", muchas veces imitados y nunca igualados–– son imágenes icónicas y personajes de escenas llenas tanto de ironía como de cariño. Momentos de su amor a la Colombia de su niñez y juventud, aunque en sus últimos trabajos su arte es también comentario social.

MRI: Me da mucha alegría conversar contigo para CNN en Español. Siempre te recuerdo como un buen amigo lleno de curiosidad por la vida. A muchas personas les interesa saber ¿cuál ha sido el tema ––o sujeto–– que más has disfrutado pintar a lo largo de tu carrera? No sé por qué, pero esas mujeres en el baño ––o tiradas boca abajo, felices y con una pierna levantada––, me parece que te gustan mucho. También siempre he notado que te gusta plasmar visiones de la realidad social –– y la vida sencilla–– de tus personajes…

FB: Mi pintura tiene dos fuentes primordiales: mis puntos de vista estéticos y el mundo latinoamericano en el cual crecí. El núcleo de mi obra está inspirado en mis recuerdos de infancia y juventud en Medellín, Colombia donde nací. No hay duda… Siempre he mantenido que el arte, cuanto más local, más universal. Mi temática es local, pero mi lenguaje estético es universal, influenciado por los grandes maestros de la pintura del Quattrocento italiano que tanto admiro, en especial Piero della Francesca.

MRI: ¿Te molesta que muchos llamen a tus voluptuosas y voluminosas mujeres ""las gordas de Botero""? (Gorditas que, siempre te decía, ¡las notaba muy felices y contentas!)

FB: No, no me molesta, aunque mi obra no es un comentario acerca de la flacura o la gordura o la obesidad. Mi interés principal radica en el volumen y en la sensualidad del arte a través de la exaltación del volumen. Yo pinto un universo de volumen en el cual cada cosa está pintada con la misma intención, con el mismo gesto. Una mujer o un hombre… igual que una fruta.

MRI: ¿Por qué el volumen o las grandes formas te atraen tanto?

FB: Porque eso cambió la pintura. Giotto fue el primero en los siglos XIII y XIV, creando una revolución porque hasta entonces, la pintura era plana y el creó volumen. Ahora nos parece normal que un cuadro tenga volumen, pero en el siglo XII no era así. Esto creó las bases del Renacimiento italiano, donde participaron todos los grandes artistas. Ese volumen sensual fue una marca para mí.

MRI: Tu exposición actual en Madrid, Botero: 60 años de pintura, es la mayor retrospectiva de tu obra y está teniendo un éxito maravilloso… (Estará abierta hasta el 7 de febrero de 2021 en el Centro del Ayuntamiento de Madrid)

FB: ¡Me da mucha alegría! Viajé a Madrid a principios de mi carrera con el dinero de un premio que me gané y me acuerdo de la ilusión de conocer el Museo del Prado y ver tantas obras maravillosas. Era mi primer viaje a Europa y tenía 19 años. Y recuerdo una España distinta, muy pobre… ¡pero yo estaba feliz de estar en Europa!

MRI: ¿Imaginaste alguna vez que ibas a ser tan famoso?

FB: Cuando comenzaba mi carrera como pobre estudiante de arte, jamás pensé que mi obra alcanzaría el reconocimiento que tiene hoy en día. Me tocó vivir momentos difíciles de rechazo por parte de la crítica, pero siempre me mantuve fiel a mis principios estéticos, a pesar de tener que nadar muchas veces en contra de las corrientes artísticas que predominaban en aquel entonces. ¡Creo que eso ha sido fundamental! Siempre pensé que lo primero que debe hacer un artista en la vida es acostumbrarse a la injusticia. Hoy en día siento una gran satisfacción al ver cómo mi obra despierta gran entusiasmo en el público, aún cuando he expuesto en países y en culturas muy lejanas a la nuestra como la china. Siempre he creído que el arte debe tener la capacidad de comunicarse directamente con el espectador, sin necesidad de intermediarios ni explicaciones. El gran arte tiene una actitud positiva ante la vida.

MRI: ¿Sigues pintando todos los días?

FB: Todos los días trabajo. Ahora con las limitaciones de la pandemia paso unas cuatro horas al día en mi estudio en vez de siete u ocho. Trabajar me produce un placer infinito… Es mi fuente de equilibrio. Después hago una vida normal como la de todo el mundo. Leo el periódico, voy a restaurantes que me gustan, veo películas de noche antes de dormir…

MRI: ¿Tienes una obra favorita?

FB: No tengo favoritas. Es difícil decirlo. He hecho infinidad de esculturas monumentales, por ejemplo, y le tengo gran cariño a un caballo. Hay obras que lo dejan a uno satisfecho y ese caballo me produce esa satisfacción.

MRI: ¿Y tu amor por los toros?

FB: La tauromaquia ha sido un tema de grandes pintores. Ahí nació mi interés por pintar los toros y admirar esa tradición. Empecé pintando toros en Medellín y es un tema que me ha interesado toda la vida. Y como espectáculo me encanta.

MRI: Una vez me contaste de haber visto unas copias de tu trabajo en una galería de la avenida Madison en Nueva York. ¿Cómo te sientes ante las copias?

FB: Me siento halagado casi siempre porque es una forma de mostrar admiración e interés en mi obra. ¡Claro que si luego firman el cuadro con Botero eso ya me gusta menos! Pero si hacen una copia para vender a los turistas no me molesta...

MRI: ¿Es agradable la fama?

FB: (Se ríe) Sí, es muy agradable porque siempre le dan a uno la mejor mesa en el restaurante y todo se facilita. Y cuando alguien se acerca y me dice ""maestro, ¿me da un autógrafo?"", me gusta mucho y no puedo negarlo. ¡Y me parece una hipocresía cuando la gente dice lo contrario!

MRI: Recuerdo lo que me has contado sobre tu niñez y que al morir tu papá, tu mamá y hermanos la pasaron mal y con muchos sacrificios. Y ahora, con el reconocimiento de tu trabajo, eres un hombre que lo tiene todo. Y te recuerdo como el hombre más seguro en sí mismo que he conocido. Aún así, ¿te falta algo en la vida?

FB: ¡Ay, Mari, me hacen falta años, muchos años para seguir haciendo lo que más me gusta que es trabajar!

MRI: Nunca te he preguntado si eras religioso o no. Muchos de nosotros nos acercamos más a ese mundo desconocido con el paso de los años.

FB: No soy religioso. Nunca lo he sido como tampoco lo fue nadie de mi familia. Sin embargo, la religión es un tema que me ha fascinado desde siempre porque permite infinidad de posibilidades plásticas, de colorido y de composición. Además, el arte sacro ha sido uno de los grandes temas de la historia del arte.

MRI: ¿Cuál es el lugar de la Tierra que más te gusta? ¿Dónde eres más feliz?

FB: ¡En mi estudio, cuando me encuentro en frente de mi obra!

MRI: ¿Cómo es ahora Fernando Botero?

FB: Soy el mismo de siempre, agradecido con la vida. Muy agradecido.","['mi', 'que', 'y', 'es', 'artista', 'fernando', 'botero', 'el', 'opinión', 'la', 'su', 'una', 'en', 'los', 'amigo', 'columna']","Siempre digo que es el hombre más seguro de sí mismo que haya conocido.

642,"Quién debió ser la ""Persona del Año"" de TIME (Opinión)","Taylor Swift es la ""Persona del Año"" de la revista TIME de 2023.

Nota del editor: Holly Thomas es una escritora y editora con sede en Londres. Es editora matutina en Katie Couric Media. Tuitea en @HolstaT.

(CNN) -- Taylor Swift es la ""Persona del Año"" 2023 de Time y, al parecer, soy la única mujer de la generación millennial en la Tierra que no se siente identificada.



Vale, eso es una exageración. Pero desde el anuncio, parece como si a un rincón específico de Spotify Wrapped le hubiera picado una araña radiactiva y hubiera adquirido poderes sobrehumanos.

Me alegro por ella, supongo. No tengo nada en contra de que una persona aparentemente agradable la pase bien, y no se puede negar que ha tenido un año estelar. Como detalla Time, Swift ha conseguido más álbumes número 1 que ninguna otra mujer en la historia, los líderes mundiales le ruegan que vaya de gira por sus países y, al parecer, se ha vuelto multimillonaria. ""Swift es la rara persona que es a la vez la escritora y la heroína de su propia historia"", dice Time. Eso está muy bien. Pero esa historia no me parece especialmente convincente.

Vaya, me siento tan mezquina. Soy muy consciente de que esto molestará a la gente, y nunca querría robarle la alegría a nadie. Todos hemos tenido conversaciones con gente que simplemente no ""entiende"" la música o la televisión que nos gusta. Normalmente, mi respuesta a esas quejas es: ""No pasa nada, no está hecho para ti"". Pero parte de lo que me inquieta es la sensación de que Swift, y las historias que cuenta a través de su música, están básicamente dirigidas a mí. Si me pusieras al lado de todos los que conozco y que están extasiados con su éxito, no me distinguirías. Pero no trago. No es porque piense que haya algo malo en ella. En todo caso, mi elección para ""Persona del Año"" de Time sería más problemática.

Históricamente, el destinatario del título ha sido a menudo un provocador. La idea no es necesariamente que gane la ""mejor"" persona, aunque ciertamente ha sido así en ocasiones, sino que se reconozca a la persona que ha tenido la mayor influencia, para ""bien o para mal"", durante los 12 meses anteriores. Entre los ganadores anteriores figuran Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Greta Thunberg, Martin Luther King Jr. y Elon Musk. La lista de finalistas este año incluía a los huelguistas de Hollywood, el presidente de China, Xi Jinping, Barbie, el presidente de la Reserva Federal, Jerome Powell, el presidente de Rusia, Vladimir Putin, los fiscales del caso Trump, el rey Carlos III y el CEO de OpenAI, Sam Altman. Time acabó nombrando a Altman CEO del año. Creo que debería haberse llevado el título máximo.

publicidad

Por si aún no te suena, Altman es el CEO de 38 años de OpenAI, la startup tecnológica responsable de la creación de ChatGPT. ChatGPT es un revolucionario chatbot de inteligencia artificial generativa que se lanzó en noviembre de 2022. Desde entonces ha asombrado a los observadores aprobando exámenes en facultades de Derecho y Empresariales, escribiendo solicitudes de empleo y código informático eficaces y componiendo parte de un discurso político para el presidente de Israel.

Las implicaciones de esta tecnología son a la vez milagrosas y aterradoras, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta la posibilidad de que las campañas de desinformación influyan en las elecciones presidenciales de 2024. Además de OpenAI, muchas empresas compiten por hacerse con una parte del lucrativo mercado de la inteligencia artificial y por desarrollar sistemas cada vez más sofisticados. Aunque el gobierno de Biden acaba de presentar una ley para regular este sector en plena expansión, el ritmo de desarrollo es tan rápido que a los gobiernos les resulta difícil seguirle el ritmo.

El misterio y la velocidad de la carrera de la IA quedaron patentes en noviembre, cuando, menos de un año después del lanzamiento de ChatGPT, Altman fue despedido repentinamente por la junta directiva de su empresa. Pocos días después, Microsoft, el mayor accionista de OpenAI, anunció que contrataba a Altman para dirigir un nuevo equipo de IA. Esto provocó una revuelta masiva entre el personal de OpenAI, casi todos los cuales amenazaron con dimitir a menos que se volviera a contratar a Altman. A los pocos días lo hicieron, y la junta que lo había despedido fue sustituida.

Las circunstancias del despido y la recontratación de Altman fueron muy turbias. En el comunicado en el que anunciaba su despido, la junta original acusaba a Altman de ""falta de franqueza en sus comunicaciones"", pero no explicaba qué significaba eso. Y lo que es aún más preocupante, el regreso de Altman y la reestructuración de OpenAI se han caracterizado como una victoria de los ""aceleracionistas"" de la IA, es decir, los que creen que la tecnología debe desarrollarse lo más rápido posible, sin limitaciones por motivos de seguridad. El episodio demostró que Altman no solamente era capaz de encabezar el invento potencialmente más importante del siglo XXI hasta la fecha. Fue capaz de trastocar el ecosistema que lo creó en cuestión de días.

Esto, creo, es lo que le falta a Swift como ""Persona del Año"" de Time. Su predominio en el sector del entretenimiento es innegable, pero su historia es esencialmente la de convertirse en mega-éxito dentro de un marco existente. Como ella misma declaró a Time, vivimos en una sociedad patriarcal alimentada por el dinero, así que ""que las ideas femeninas sean lucrativas significa que se hará más arte femenino"". No está ni un millón de kilómetros lejos de ""si no puedes con ellas, úneteles"".

La impresión de que nadie prevé ninguna polémica por parte de Swift a corto plazo se vio reforzada en noviembre cuando Gannett, la mayor cadena de periódicos de Estados Unidos, contrató a la primera corresponsal de Swift. El periodista en cuestión, Bryan West, de 35 años, es un admirador declarado. Aunque a algunos les pueda parecer extraño contratar a alguien con un sesgo tan obvio, West ha argumentado que no es diferente de ""ser un periodista deportivo aficionado al equipo local"". Se esté o no de acuerdo con esa comparación, es innegable que a él le interesa profesionalmente que Swift siga siendo popular y relevante, y no parece probable que el apetito por historias sobre ella vaya a disminuir pronto.

Por eso Altman, y no Swift, debería haber sido la ""Persona del Año"" de Time. Su impacto en el mundo podría ser exponencialmente más importante, pero no hay suficiente gente que lo conozca o que sepa las implicaciones de su tecnología. Cada movimiento de Swift, por fortuito que sea, es objeto de febriles intrigas y especulaciones. En San Francisco, Altman está haciendo movimientos que podrían cambiar el destino del mundo. Y hasta hace un mes, la mayoría de nosotros ni siquiera sabíamos que existía.","['persona', 'que', 'año', 'y', 'quién', 'el', 'opinión', 'la', 'del', 'ser', 'en', 'los', 'es', 'altman', 'debió', 'swift']","Taylor Swift es la ""Persona del Año"" de la revista TIME de 2023.

643,Informé sobre Hamas en Gaza durante más de una década. Estas son las preguntas que me hago ahora (Opinión),"Una bengala de iluminación, disparada por las fuerzas israelíes en el noroeste de Gaza, se ve desde Sderot, Israel, el 31 de octubre. Crédito: Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu/Getty Images

Nota del editor: Ilene Prusher es una periodista y escritora que pasó dos décadas cubriendo el Medio Oriente. Enseña periodismo en la Florida Atlantic University, donde es directora digital de MediaLab@FAU. Las opiniones expresadas en este artículo pertenecen exclusivamente a su autora.

(CNN) -- Llegamos al puesto de control de Erez. Los soldados israelíes revisan nuestros pasaportes, examinan todos nuestros equipajes y nos dejan pasar. Tras una larga caminata por una tierra de nadie atrincherada, los funcionarios palestinos registran nuestros nombres y números de pasaporte y nos piden una lista de las personas con las que pensamos reunirnos. Nuestro intermediario palestino interviene, les recuerda a los tipos armados que sean amables con nosotros, los extranjeros, y presto: estamos en Gaza. En la lista de las tres o cuatro personas que tenemos previsto ver a lo largo del día hay al menos un alto funcionario de Hamas.



Esta es una rutina en la que participé, de forma intermitente, durante 16 años de mi vida, mientras informaba sobre el conflicto israelí-palestino para medios de comunicación estadounidenses en las décadas de 1990 y 2000, hasta mi último viaje a Gaza en enero de 2009, al final de otra guerra entre Israel y Hamas que conmocionó al mundo y causó muerte y destrucción innecesarias.

Más tarde, en 2014, cubrí para la revista TIME una guerra mucho más mortífera entre Israel y Hamas que duró 50 días, esta vez desde el sur de Israel, Tel Aviv y Jerusalén, principalmente porque para entonces ya tenía dos niños pequeños en casa y ya no creía que arriesgarme a entrar en Gaza mereciera la pena.

En casi todos los viajes que hice, y fueron demasiados, me reuní con funcionarios de Hamas, como parece que hicieron todos los buenos periodistas. Como muchos otros, tenía curiosidad por conocer su punto de vista y, en la época en la que la pacificación era una posibilidad e Israel estaba entregando territorio al Gobierno Autónomo Palestino, quería entender por qué no aceptaban el acuerdo de tierra por paz conocido como los Acuerdos de Oslo.

El proceso de Oslo para dividir la tierra con Israel y crear una zona de autonomía palestina, y posiblemente un Estado, había sido aceptado, al menos tibiamente, por el difunto Yasser Arafat, jefe de la Organización para la Liberación Palestina (OLP). Pero Hamas, el rival palestino más importante de la OLP, se oponía radicalmente a la paz con Israel e insistía en que el único camino era la ""resistencia armada"" para erradicar a Israel. A lo largo de la década de 1990, cuando el proceso de paz avanzaba, Hamas intentó desbaratarlo volando autobuses y cafés israelíes.

Para principios de la década de 2000, cuando el proceso de paz se paralizó, habían matado a cientos de civiles israelíes de esta forma, lo que provocó una mayor separación de las sociedades israelí y palestina.

Los dirigentes y portavoces de Hamas que accedieron a nuestras entrevistas rara vez eran lo que cabría esperar de los representantes de una organización terrorista. Eran hombres que hablaban inglés con soltura, que expresaban sus quejas con lógica y que, además, tenían estudios superiores, normalmente de ingeniería o medicina. Se presentaban a sí mismos como parte de un ""ala política"" de Hamas, que desconocía lo que planeaba el ala militar, más reservada. A menudo, insistían estos portavoces, no tenían ni idea de que un ataque era inminente.

En general, los periodistas nos lo tragábamos. Nuestros editores querían que tuviéramos acceso a este oscuro grupo y que explicáramos su atractivo para los palestinos de a pie y, en particular, el desafío estratégico que suponía para Arafat. Al afirmar que la mano izquierda de la organización no sabía lo que hacía la derecha, Hamas evitaba fácilmente las preguntas difíciles, como por qué atacar a civiles en lugar de objetivos militares, y a muchos de nosotros nos convenía sentir que estábamos tomando el pulso palestino en lugar de sentarnos a tomar el té con terroristas.

Así que tomamos a sorbos sus amargas infusiones, y ellos sabían qué decir. ""Mire, no nos hace ninguna gracia ver volar por los aires a civiles israelíes"", me dijo un portavoz, en los tiempos en los que la peor arma de Hamas era un terrorista suicida en una zona urbana, antes de insistir en que esos atentados eran la única respuesta racional a lo que ellos consideraban la ocupación israelí de tierras palestinas.

Cuando les pregunté por qué Hamas no intentaba negociar en lugar de hacer eso, me respondieron que no tenía sentido hablar con Israel, y que Israel tampoco estaba precisamente dispuesto a hablar con Hamas. El portavoz insistió en que no utilizara su nombre con esa cita casi empática sobre no alegrarse de matar israelíes. En retrospectiva, me pregunto si lo dijo porque sabía que sonaba bien al oído occidental.

Hamas jugó otros juegos con el lenguaje, presentándose como razonable al decir que sus líderes en teoría aceptarían una hudna, o tregua a largo plazo, con Israel.

Sus palabras suenan bien, ¿quién no preferiría una tregua duradera a la horrible matanza y destrucción de la que ahora somos testigos? Pero la realidad era que Hamas nunca firmaría un acuerdo permanente con Israel porque, según me dijeron sus dirigentes, el Islam lo prohibía.

Y luego estaban las distorsiones descaradas. Antes del 7 de octubre, Hamas engañó a Israel haciéndole creer que la organización no estaba interesada en agravar la situación y que quería mejorar la vida en Gaza. Con esa idea en mente, Israel de hecho flexibilizó los pasos fronterizos de Gaza a finales de septiembre, una semana antes del ataque, para permitir la entrada de más trabajadores palestinos en Israel. Lamentablemente, la apertura a miles de trabajadores adicionales procedentes de Gaza convirtió a Israel en un coladero de información del que, según reportes, Hamas obtuvo información para su ataque de octubre.

Hamas también jugó a su conveniencia con los hechos que nos dieron a los periodistas. Durante la primera gran guerra entre Israel y Hamas de 2008 a 2009, conocida como Operación Plomo Fundido, Hamas dijo que menos de 50 de los 1.400 muertos en Gaza habían sido combatientes. Pero más de un año después, el ministro del Interior de Hamas reconoció en una entrevista con el periódico Al-Hayat, con sede en Londres, que entre 600 y 700 de sus combatientes habían muerto en esa guerra. En esa y en casi todas las guerras desde entonces, Hamas u otros grupos extremistas de Gaza lanzaron cohetes que cayeron involuntariamente sobre sus propios ciudadanos, pero rara vez, o nunca, reconocieron el error y culparon a Israel de las muertes.

Sin embargo, ¿cuántas veces eso nos impidió informar lo que nos decían? Esa dinámica se puso de manifiesto el mes pasado, cuando muchos medios de comunicación convencionales repitieron inmediatamente la afirmación de Hamas de que un ataque aéreo israelí había devastado un hospital y matado a 500 palestinos.

Más tarde aparecieron más detalles que indicaban que lo más probable es que fuera la Yihad Islámica, organización rival de Hamas, la que había disparado un misil errante que cayó en el lugar, y que el número de víctimas era mucho menor.

Los hospitales volvieron a ser protagonistas de la guerra cuando Israel rodeó el hospital Al-Shifa tras afirmar que Hamas había operado desde él. Hamas ha negado durante mucho tiempo el uso de hospitales a pesar de las pruebas de que lo hace, e hizo lo mismo esta vez a pesar de que hay pruebas de que se encontraron armas en el lugar y de que se han construido túneles para permitir a la organización utilizar Al-Shifa como base.

Los periodistas pueden sentir que no tienen más remedio que confiar en las cifras y desmentidos de Hamas porque quedan pocos reporteros en Gaza y pocas opciones de verificar algo de forma independiente. Pero muchos periodistas podrían ser más transparentes sobre la falta de verificación independiente y proporcionar el contexto de lo poco fiable que ha demostrado ser Hamas en el pasado.

Una cosa que ya quedó clara después del 7 de octubre es que los miembros de Hamas no parecían no haber experimentado ""ninguna alegría"" por la matanza de más de 1.200 israelíes y el secuestro de más de 200 personas. Los combatientes de Hamas se reían mientras cometían los atentados, según testigos presenciales, y se grababan a sí mismos mientras arrasaban alegremente los hogares israelíes.

¿Cambió Hamas? ¿O estaban muchos de los medios de comunicación demasiado dispuestos a verlos como algo distinto a lo que siempre han sido?

Probablemente sea un poco de ambas cosas. Aunque se fundó en 1987 como una organización expresamente palestina, hay pruebas de que Hamas se ha visto influida por el estilo y la brutalidad de los grupos yihadistas mundiales en general, y de ISIS en particular. Aun así, Hamas ha seguido centrándose en ""la entidad sionista"", no en Estados Unidos, otros objetivos occidentales u otras religiones per se. Y en la medida en que hubo una vez un ala política que podría haber tenido aspiraciones diferentes, el 7 de octubre no dejó ninguna duda de que el ala militar es ahora el centro del poder y la estrategia de Hamas.

No es que la mayoría de los medios de comunicación presentáramos a Hamas como inocente o moderada. Pero durante años, demasiados de nosotros tratamos al grupo más como un partido de oposición con ocasionales arrebatos violentos que como una organización terrorista. De hecho, mientras hacía prácticas en Reuters al principio de mi carrera, a mediados de la década de 1990, aprendí que nunca debíamos llamar terroristas a Hamas o a la Yihad Islámica, sino militantes. Varios medios de comunicación mantienen esa política, incluso en medio de la masacre del 7 de octubre, que se ajusta claramente a la definición de terror como un ataque mortal contra civiles con fines ideológicos.

Los periodistas que trabajan en zonas de conflicto muy a menudo no dan su brazo a torcer para aparentar neutralidad, o quizá para asegurarse de estar en el lado amable de los combatientes al mando. Muchas de las preguntas que ahora resuenan en mi cabeza no tienen una respuesta fácil, pero puedo decir que el objetivo último para muchos de nosotros en los medios de comunicación era garantizar el acceso continuo a la gran historia, no considerar si las personas con las que estábamos tratando eran buenos actores o fuentes fiables. Aunque es importante que los lectores y espectadores escuchen tanto las voces palestinas como las de los israelíes, tratar a Hamas como si fuera un gobierno legítimo fue quizá lo peor de caer en un sesgo de falso equilibrio.

En 2014, un periodista alemán fue criticado duramente por infiltrarse en ISIS para un documental. Intentar explicar a un grupo de asesinos tan despreciable iba más allá de lo razonable, dijeron los críticos. ¿Acaso no había actores cuyo comportamiento era tan atroz que no merecían una tribuna, ni siquiera una cita, lo que les otorgaría cierta legitimidad?

¿Es este el enfoque que deberíamos haber adoptado con Hamas, o que deberíamos adoptar en el futuro? En un mundo ideal, sí, pero en este mundo distópico que estamos presenciando tal vez sea demasiado esperar. Mientras tanto, si los periodistas seguimos entrevistando a miembros de Hamas, deberíamos informar de sus palabras de forma más crítica y no tomar sus comentarios sin cuestionar. Debemos proporcionar un contexto que señale lo no verificable que es su información y lo pobre que ha sido su historial de precisión. Y no debemos dejar de preguntarnos si nuestras entrevistas les otorgan demasiada legitimidad y les dan más tribuna que la que merecen.","['preguntas', 'que', 'informé', 'hamas', 'y', 'las', 'el', 'opinión', 'la', 'una', 'más', 'en', 'los', 'sobre', 'lo', 'son']","Eran hombres que hablaban inglés con soltura, que expresaban sus quejas con lógica y que, además, tenían estudios superiores, normalmente de ingeniería o medicina.

(CNN Español) -- La elección de Javier Milei a la presidencia de Argentina surtirá diversos efectos en su propio país: desde las consecuencias de un nuevo fracaso gubernamental -lo más probable- hasta un éxito inesperado de propuestas radicales, insólitas, experimentales. En el mundo habrá interés por conocer el destino de esas propuestas, sin más. Será en América Latina, sin embargo, donde se resentirán mayormente las consecuencias del triunfo del “libertario”, como se define a sí mismo, o del extremista e iconoclasta, como lo perciben muchos otros. Por eso, resulta interesante un análisis preliminar de las reacciones ya existentes y probables en otros países de la región frente a un acontecimiento imprevisto para varios gobernantes.

La primera respuesta latinoamericana tendió a ser de sorpresa y de decepción o malestar. Es lógico: la mayoría de los países más importantes de la región se encuentran gobernados por mandatarios y partidos autodenominados de izquierda, por lo tanto, más afines al peronismo. Muchos de ellos, como López Obrador, en México, y Lula, en Brasil, habían construido relaciones personales estrechas con Alberto Fernández, el presidente en funciones en Argentina. Y también muchos parecen haber creído en los analistas que pronosticaban una victoria de Sergio Massa, el candidato peronista. Por lo tanto, el desconcierto y el disgusto se generalizaron rápidamente.

Lula manifestó su desagrado, dentro de los cánones diplomáticos, y habría amenazado con no asistir a la toma de posesión de Milei, sobre todo si acudía Jair Bolsonaro, el expresidente brasileño. López Obrador consideró que el pueblo argentino anotó un “autogol”, y Gustavo Petro, de Colombia, lamentó que América Latina haya vivido un día “triste” al elegir a Milei. El chileno Gabriel Boric fue prudente, mientras que otros presidentes más desparpajados -Maduro en Venezuela, Díaz-Canel en Cuba- emitieron declaraciones altisonantes o simplemente permanecieron callados. Luis Lacalle Pou, el presidente de Uruguay, al contrario, felicitó a Milei por teléfono desde China, donde se encontraba en visita oficial.

La primera prueba de fuego será la toma de posesión de Milei el 10 de diciembre. Antes que nada, se verá cómo actúan los otros miembros de Mercosur, o los vecinos de Argentina. Brasil deberá decidir a quién envía. Para Lula, asistir junto con Bolsonaro se antoja imposible, aunque Milei le haya enviado una invitación formal; desistir del viaje, con motivo de todas las declaraciones virulentas de Milei contra el presidente de Brasil antes de su elección, le dificultaría a la diplomacia y el comercio brasileños un vínculo indispensable con el vecino. Además, la presencia del presidente Víktor Orban y de Santiago Abascal, los ultraderechistas de Hungría y VOX en España, seguramente no alentará a Lula a comparecer. Joe Biden y Andrés Manuel López Obrador ya declinaron la invitación, invocando problemas de agenda.

De los otros miembros plenos de Mercosur, Paraguay probablemente asistirá y el presidente de Bolivia, Luis Arce, según la prensa local, está revisando su agenda para ver si puede acudir; Boric ha anunciado su intención de viajar. La clave, sin embargo, residirá en la postura de Milei sobre el Mercosur; allí se encontrará con dos socios de izquierda -Brasil y Bolivia- y dos más bien de corte conservador -Uruguay y Paraguay. Por un lado, no debe complacerle mucho la idea de una asociación de ese tipo: durante la campaña afirmó que se trataba de una unión aduanera defectuosa que “perjudicaba a los argentinos de bien”. Por otro lado, a pesar de la casi permanente crisis del mecanismo, reviste una gran importancia para Buenos Aires, sobre todo en vista de las dificultades de cerrar acuerdos bilaterales de libre comercio con la Unión Europea, y la ausencia de perspectivas de cualquier negociación con Estados Unidos. La esperanza del equipo de Milei de que el convenio Mercosur-UE se firme pronto parece un poco ilusa.

Un segundo impacto latinoamericano de la elección de Milei se verá reflejado en los posibles cambios en la correlación de fuerzas en organismos regionales de corte político, como la OEA y la Celac. La preponderancia de gobiernos de izquierda en la región revitalizó a la Celac -a la que pertenecen Cuba, Venezuela y Nicaragua, pero no EE.UU. ni Canadá- y la postura favorable de Argentina contribuía en buena medida a su supuesto relanzamiento, justamente bajo la presidencia pro tempore del actual jefe de Estado, Alberto Fernández. Asimismo, en la OEA, la renuencia de Argentina de votar a favor de la aplicación de la Carta Democrática Interamericana a Nicaragua facilitó la composición de un bloque que vetara este procedimiento. Es probable que Milei vea con mejores ojos tal procedimiento con Nicaragua, aunque no tendría efectos, ya que el país dejó de pertenecer a la OEA el mes pasado. En todo caso, la relación bilateral entre ambos países no luce promisoria. A menos de una semana de la toma de posesión, el régimen de Ortega retiró a su embajador en Buenos Aires.

En términos generales, haciendo a un lado la estridencia de una parte y de otra durante la campaña argentina y ahora en la transición entre ambos gobiernos, es probable que Milei se separe del bloque de izquierda latinoamericano, sin confrontarse en lo bilateral con cada uno de los países. El cambio en el equilibrio regional es importante, aunque no decisivo. De la misma manera, la futura canciller Diana Modino ya dijo que Argentina no se uniría al Brics en un reciente trino de su cuenta de X, y parece factible que se retracte en alguna medida del apoyo de Fernández a Rusia poco antes de que estallara el conflicto con Ucrania. Digamos, Buenos Aires pasará de una afinidad con el bloque bolivariano de América Latina y su “no alineamiento activo”, en la expresión de Jorge Heine y Carlos Ominami, a una posición más cercana a Washington. No se trata de un asunto menor.","['que', 'latina', 'cerca', 'y', 'milei', 'washington', 'sus', 'opinión', 'américa', 'más', 'la', 'en', 'el', 'se', 'del', 'una', 'su', 'socios']","En el mundo habrá interés por conocer el destino de esas propuestas, sin más.

(CNN) -- Hay lugares en nuestra frontera sur que nos cambian, imágenes que nos obligan a lidiar con nosotros mismos. Me detuve en un acantilado y el desierto de Chihuahua de 500.000 kilómetros cuadrados me miró fijamente, preguntándome por qué manchamos su arena con la sangre de niños.

¿Por qué damos la espalda al sufrimiento de nuestros hermanos y hermanas que se adentran en el calor y dejan sus vidas y sus sueños en sus cañones? ¿Por qué toleramos un sistema de inmigración que castiga por igual a los desesperados y a los pacientes y que, al mismo tiempo, es incapaz de proporcionar suficientes trabajadores legales a Estados Unidos o una seguridad fronteriza eficaz?

¿Por qué los inmigrantes siguen gritando: ""No, no, me quedo aquí. Voy a intentar pasar""? Estas preguntas me llevan a pensar que debemos unirnos como un solo país y comprometernos hacia una solución que asegure nuestra frontera y respete el Estado de Derecho y la humanidad de todas las personas.

Nuestra tarea pendiente desde hace mucho tiempo es unificarnos y aprobar una reforma integral de la inmigración, y hacerlo ahora, incluyendo que el Congreso acepte propuestas razonables para mejorar la seguridad fronteriza como parte de un paquete más amplio de ayuda exterior. Este pequeño compromiso puede sentar unas bases sólidas para un plan más amplio.

publicidad

Hasta ahora, he trazado mis propias líneas en la arena. Por ejemplo, descarté ideas como la construcción de un largo y costoso muro fronterizo y el despliegue de nuestro Ejército. Creía que un muro enviaba un mensaje equivocado a nuestros vecinos y era un despilfarro de dinero. Temía que nuestros militares, entrenados para matar al enemigo, hicieran precisamente eso con familias de inmigrantes desarmados a los que confundían con delincuentes, terroristas o miembros de cárteles. En el pasado, interrumpí los debates sobre este tipo de medidas y bloqueé las oportunidades de compromiso, prefiriendo más agentes fronterizos y tecnología como cámaras y sensores de movimiento.

Hoy, sin embargo, estamos en crisis, agravada por un estancamiento legislativo que ni atiende a los gritos de los migrantes que huyen de la violencia ni a los deseos de los votantes de que se establezcan limitaciones razonables a la entrada. Nuestras comunidades están desbordadas por los inmigrantes y sus necesidades, sobre todo porque los estados cercanos a la frontera siguen transportando en autobús a los recién llegados al norte.

Las ideas que hemos barajado aún no se han materializado en soluciones. Así que me he retado a mí mismo a estar abierto a otras posibilidades, al menos durante esta crisis. Como dijo el exsenador Howard Baker: ""El otro puede tener razón"", y hasta ahora, las posiciones ideológicas inflexibles de ambos partidos políticos han demostrado ser erróneas. Los estadounidenses están de acuerdo.

En una encuesta reciente del Vanderbilt Project on Unity & American Democracy, el 80% de los encuestados expresó su apoyo al compromiso legislativo incluso cuando se incluyen escenarios reales desafiantes.

El Artículo I de la Constitución de EE.UU. otorga al Congreso, y no al presidente, el poder de establecer una ""regla uniforme de naturalización"", es decir, la política de inmigración. En circunstancias normales, el presidente está limitado por las herramientas de inmigración que el Congreso le otorga en forma de legislación.

Hoy, sin embargo, la situación en la frontera ha llegado a un punto de quiebre. Debemos tomar el control.

Los senadores luchan por encontrar un punto intermedio sobre los cambios en la política de inmigración, clave para aprobar la ayuda a Ucrania e Israel

La conclusión a la que he llegado es que el presidente puede tener que recurrir a sus poderes constitucionales de emergencia para aplicar medidas temporales, como la construcción de barreras físicas en lugares estratégicos y el uso de nuestros militares en un papel de apoyo en circunstancias limitadas y reglas de enfrentamiento bien entendidas.

Durante esta crisis, Estados Unidos debería considerar la posibilidad de limitar el número de concesiones a los solicitantes de asilo y suspender temporalmente las nuevas solicitudes de estatus legal para poner orden en nuestra casa y recuperar el control de nuestras fronteras. Debemos identificar y expulsar inmediatamente a todo aquel que constituya una amenaza.

Una vez recuperado el control, nuestro país podrá volver a centrar su atención en un plan de inmigración más completo y coherente con nuestros valores: un plan que sea justo con los inmigrantes que han seguido las normas esperando pacientemente fuera de nuestras fronteras, que promueva el crecimiento económico, que no recompense ni encarcele a quienes entraron en el país sin la documentación necesaria, y que proteja a los ciudadanos estadounidenses y sus propiedades.

No obstante, es importante reiterar que la reforma integral de la política de inmigración es necesaria y el objetivo final.

El presidente debe liderar, y el Congreso legislar y asignar. Cada día que esperamos, más gente muere en ese desierto, los campos de cosecha se quedan en barbecho sin trabajadores, las cadenas de suministro se retrasan y el espíritu emprendedor de este país, alimentado, irónicamente, por los inmigrantes, se apaga.

Las ciudades de Estados Unidos ya no tienen recursos ni capacidad para pagar los costos del orgullo y la obstinación del Congreso. Como informó CNN, un número récord de migrantes está cruzando hacia Estados Unidos, desbordando ciudades como Nueva York y Chicago.

Ha sido el deber constitucional de cada legislador de este milenio encontrar una solución, y hemos fracasado. Debemos ser humildes y dejar a un lado nuestras ideologías, y proteger a nuestros ciudadanos, al Estado de Derecho y a los inmigrantes que buscan una vida mejor para sus familias.

Y como ciudadanos, debemos mostrar amabilidad hacia nuestros legisladores, para que se sientan seguros de hacer lo que saben que es correcto, y comprometerse sin miedo a represalias.

La política de inmigración afecta a nuestra economía, nuestra seguridad nacional y nuestra política exterior, así como a las relaciones con la familia y los amigos. Influye en la esencia misma de lo que somos como país.

Cuando no se aplica correctamente, esa política amenaza nuestra paz y estabilidad.

Una vez que adoptemos un marco global a largo plazo, seremos más fuertes y estaremos más seguros en un mundo cada vez más peligroso, unidos y más capacitados para afrontar juntos los retos que nos aguardan.","['que', 'sur', 'y', 'frontera', 'para', 'punto', 'el', 'opinión', 'la', 'una', 'en', 'se', 'quiebre', 'los', 'como', 'llegó', 'crisis', 'eeuu']","¿Por qué damos la espalda al sufrimiento de nuestros hermanos y hermanas que se adentran en el calor y dejan sus vidas y sus sueños en sus cañones?

(CNN Español) -- Iba a llamarlo inefable congresista, porque inefable significa algo que no puede explicarse con palabras. Pero entonces cómo iba a describir en esta nota al legislador de Estados Unidos más imaginativo y mentiroso que he visto en mi vida.

No soy un creyente de la clase política en general, pero el asunto sorprende mucho más en esta, la primera democracia del mundo: donde todos somos iguales ante la ley; nuestro voto decide periódicamente quién nos guiará hacia la felicidad y todo el Gobierno y sus agencias son nuestros empleados.

Este viernes George Santos fue expulsado de la Cámara de Representantes por 311 votos a favor de la moción y 114 en contra. Me pregunto qué tendrían en la cabeza los 114 congresistas (112 republicanos y dos demócratas) que no quisieron expulsarlo. Pero, por ahora, el caso de Santos se da por terminado, al menos políticamente.

Aunque, mirándolo bien, George Santos como político era un verdadero desperdicio de talento. Equivocó su carrera. Habría sido un buen novelista, un conocido actor, un líder religioso y en general, cualquier profesión que transforme legalmente la realidad en un agradable objeto de arte o de consumo. Su osadía conoció pocos limites: se declaró judío, pero a veces decía ser católico; dijo que su madre estuvo presente en las Torres Gemelas el 11 de septiembre de 2001, pero en realidad no estaba en el país. En una entrevista con The New York Post, Santos admitió que “embelleció” su currículum cuando se postuló como candidato al Congreso

Oh, querido George, ¿por qué no fuiste más calculador al elegir ser político? Te repito, podías haber sido también un mago. Habrías dado rienda suelta a tu creatividad y no habrías corrido peligro al verte frente a un juez. Y para los que no han vivido de cerca la saga del maravilloso congresista George Santos, aquí les expongo algunas de las acusaciones legales más más graves que enfrenta y algunas divertidas interrogantes que lo convierten en un enigma viviente: Según la Comisión de Ética de la Cámara de Representantes, Santos mintió a sus donantes y usó su dinero para realizar compras en Hermes y Only Fans. Usó el dinero de la campaña para viajes personales y Botox. Mintió para cobrar prestaciones por desempleo. Cometió robos de identidad. Mintió al Congreso. Se reembolsó préstamos que nunca hizo. Mintió acerca de fundar una organización benéfica para animales. Estafó a un veterano discapacitado cuyo perro se estaba muriendo. Es posible que haya estafado también a un criador de perros amish con un cheque sin fondos. En noviembre Santos respondió en su cuenta de Twitter que el informe era una “repugnante y politizada difamación”.

Mintió sobre dónde fue a la escuela secundaria y la universidad. Nunca trabajó en Wall Street. Comprobado: su abuela no fue una víctima del Holocausto. Y no tenía empleados que murieron en el tiroteo de Pulse. Su sobrina tampoco fue secuestrada. ¿Fue realmente Drag Queen en Brasil? ¿Estuvo George Santos en Hannah Montana? ¿Era un productor de Broadway? ¿Y fue realmente periodista en Brasil? ¿Trataron de “asesinarlo” en diciembre? En resumen: ¿Qué ha dicho Santos sobre su vida que sea realmente cierto?

Posiblemente nada y tal vez su existencia no es otra cosa que un producto de nuestra imaginación. Sería mejor así. Estaríamos más tranquilos y confiados con nuestros representantes federales. Por cierto, no solo George Santos está en apuros con la ley. También lo está uno de los demócratas más poderosos del Congreso: Bob Menéndez, exjefe de la Comisión de Relaciones Exteriores del Senado. Menéndez salió ileso de su primera acusación de corrupción en 2015, pero enfrenta nuevos cargos. En su residencia las autoridades encontraron un tesoro de pruebas, incluidos cientos de miles de dólares en efectivo y lingotes de oro, que, aseguran, fueron obtenidos a cambio de usar su “poder e influencia” para beneficiar al gobierno egipcio y dos empresarios locales. Aunque se ha declarado inocente de los cargos en su contra, Menéndez se tambalea, igual que Santos, entre su curul de representante federal y la cárcel.

Santos, con su habitual costumbre de enredarlo todo -hasta su prestigio y dignidad- y ante la amenaza de una expulsión, propuso que no renunciaría a su cargo pero que no se presentaría a la reelección en 2024. Expulsarlo de la Cámara de Representantes tenía su tela: Santos no había sido encontrado culpable de sus acusaciones, lo que propiciaría, como en varios casos anteriores, una salida automática de su cargo. El otro camino, ya tomado, fue la expulsión por votación, pero hacía falta dos tercios de la Cámara de Representantes, lo que implicaría que al menos 77 de sus colegas republicanos debían votar por ella. Fueron 105 los republicanos que apoyaron la moción y con ese gesto probaron su calidad. Les importó más conservar la debida ética para el órgano legislativo que integran, que mantener a un mitómano como Santos, para subrayar su mayoría política.

Lo que verdaderamente no acabo de entender es qué pensaron los 114 representantes que votaron para tratar de evitar su expulsión. Tal vez, y de alguna forma misteriosa, la conducta y ejemplo de todos ellos inspiró a Santos en su decisión de ser un político, en vez de haber escogido ser novelista, actor, líder religioso o saltimbanqui, lo que le habría traído una mejor carrera. Aunque nunca se sabe. ¿Podrán las mentiras salvar a Santos cuando se presente ante el juez?","['maravilloso', 'que', 'santos', 'por', 'para', 'y', 'saga', 'su', 'republicano', 'opinión', 'la', 'del', 'en', 'el', 'se', 'george', 'congresista']","Como columnista, Davila Miguel ha sido premiado por la Asociación de Periodistas Hispanoamericanos y la Sociedad Interamericana de Prensa.

651,La visita de Elon Musk a Israel fue transparentemente transaccional e insultante (Opinión),"Elon Musk visitó Israel.

Nota del editor: Jill Filipovic es periodista con sede en Nueva York y autora del libro ""OK Boomer, Let's Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind"". Síguela en Twitter. Las opiniones presentadas en este artículo le pertenecen exclusivamente a su autor.

(CNN)-- Elon Musk está intentando enmendar sus errores, o al menos hacer un control de daños, después de respaldar una publicación antisemita en su plataforma X, antes Twitter.

Musk, sin embargo, en realidad no se está disculpando adecuadamente o haciendo mucho de nada para hacer frente a sus propias acciones viles repetidas o la intolerancia que se ha apoderado de X desde que tomó las riendas de la red social.

Esta semana visitó Israel, una nación en medio de una sangrienta guerra, para demostrar, como él dijo, que ""las acciones hablan más alto que las palabras"".

Por desgracia para Musk, tanto sus acciones como sus palabras son odiosas.

El último problema de Musk comenzó cuando un usuario de X se dirigió a los antisemitas de la plataforma, publicando: ""A los cobardes que se esconden tras el anonimato de Internet y publican 'Hitler tenía razón': ¿Tienen algo que decir? ¿Por qué no nos lo dicen a la cara?"".

Otro respondió: ""Vale. Las comunidades judías (sic) han estado promoviendo exactamente el tipo de odio dialéctico contra los blancos que dicen querer que la gente deje de usar contra ellos. Estoy profundamente desinteresado en que ahora me importe una p*** mierda que las poblaciones judías occidentales lleguen a la inquietante comprensión de que esas hordas de minorías que apoyan inundando su país no les caen precisamente demasiado bien"".

En respuesta, Musk replicó: ""Has dicho la auténtica verdad"".

Y luego fue más lejos, diciendo que la Liga Antidifamación (ADL, por sus siglas en inglés) ""ataca injustamente a la mayoría de Occidente"", al denunciar el antisemitismo. Musk afirmó: ""Esto se debe a que [la ADL] no puede, por sus propios principios, criticar a los grupos minoritarios que son su principal amenaza"".

Los grupos judíos no tardaron en señalar que la declaración que Musk refrendó como ""la verdad real"" es en realidad una versión de una teoría de la conspiración racista. La idea es que los judíos están dejando entrar en el país a invasores inmigrantes para despojar a los blancos de su poder y destruir la cultura blanca.

Y no se trata solo de algunos fanáticos bromeando en las redes sociales. Esta fea teoría del ""Gran Reemplazo"" ha estado detrás de tiroteos masivos dirigidos contra grupos raciales o étnicos específicos, como el de un supermercado en Buffalo en el que murieron 10 compradores y empleados negros.

La reacción a los comentarios de Musk sobre X no se hizo esperar. Los anunciantes retiraron sus campañas de X, y Musk fue objeto de críticas internacionales.

Musk viajó a Israel para reunirse con el primer ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, visitar un kibutz atacado por Hamas el 7 de octubre y conocer a algunos de los familiares de los rehenes tomados por Hamas ese día. Musk y Netanyahu mantuvieron una conversación en vivo en X, durante la cual Musk, refiriéndose a Hamas, dijo: ""Hay que neutralizar a quienes pretenden asesinar. Entonces debe cesar la propaganda"".

Añadió que hay que hacer que Gaza sea ""próspera"", y ""Si (todo) eso ocurre, creo que será un buen futuro"", señalando que le ""encantaría ayudar"".

Qué burla.

La visita de Musk a Israel fue transparentemente transaccional y francamente insultante. El sentimiento antisemita que Musk respaldó no tenía nada que ver con Israel; la ""teoría del reemplazo"" es generalmente una alegación sin fundamento de que los judíos y otros inmigrantes en EE.UU. y Europa están destruyendo la civilización occidental.

Reunirse con un multimillonario para salvar su reputación no debería ser una prioridad para los dirigentes israelíes, que en este momento siguen negociando el regreso de decenas de israelíes que Hamas mantiene como rehenes y supervisan una guerra devastadora en Gaza que ha matado a miles de civiles inocentes y desplazado a muchos más. Una charla con Musk y una visita personal a la devastación de Hamas parece que podría haber esperado.

Una visita a Israel en medio de una guerra ni siquiera se acerca a la solución del problema de raíz del antisemitismo, y no debería absolver a Musk de la responsabilidad de sus propias palabras y acciones.

Bajo el liderazgo de Musk, X se ha convertido en un pantano de prejuicios e intolerancia. Conocidos neonazis y supremacistas blancos han recuperado sus cuentas. Miembros del Estado Islámico volvieron a la plataforma y a algunos teóricos de la conspiración QAnon se les ha permitido pagar por insignias de verificación en el sitio.

En los meses posteriores a la adquisición de Musk, el discurso de odio en el sitio aumentó: los insultos raciales contra los negros se triplicaron y los mensajes antisemitas aumentaron un 61%, según un informe del Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). ¿La respuesta de Musk? Demandó al CCDH.

""X es un servicio público gratuito financiado en gran parte por anunciantes"", dijo X en una entrada de blog sobre la demanda. ""A través de la campaña de miedo del CCDH y su continua presión sobre las marcas para impedir el acceso del público a la libre expresión, el CCDH está trabajando activamente para impedir el diálogo público"".

Este mes, el grupo de vigilancia progresista Media Matters publicó un informe que mostraba que varios anuncios aparecían junto a mensajes antisemitas y pronazis en X. ¿La respuesta de Musk a ese informe? Demandó a Media Matters.

A principios de este año, la ADL publicó un informe que documentaba un aumento del contenido antisemita en X bajo la propiedad de Musk. Musk amenazó con demandarlos también, culpando a la organización de una enorme caída en las ventas de publicidad de X.

Musk ha comprometido su ""absolutismo de la libertad de expresión"", no para hacer esfuerzos significativos para prohibir a los supremacistas blancos y los neonazis, sino para impedir que se utilicen en X términos ampliamente adoptados por el movimiento propalestino, como ""descolonización"" y ""del río al mar"".

Mucha gente encuentra estos términos profundamente ofensivos cuando se aplican a Israel, ya que sugieren el fin del Estado judío y la probable expulsión de millones de judíos de la región. Pero prohibir estas palabras después de haber apoyado el antisemitismo resulta bastante irónico. Y más irónico aún ver a una serie de oportunistas y facilitadores permitir que Musk continúe con esta farsa. Netanyahu es simplemente el más reciente. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO de ADL, es otro. A pesar de que su propia organización documentó el antisemitismo generalizado en X y Musk amenazó con demandarlos por exponerlo, Greenblatt sin embargo respondió a la prohibición de la ""descolonización"" y ""del río al mar"" aplaudiendo a Musk por su ""liderazgo en la lucha contra el odio"".

Musk todavía no se ha molestado en pedir disculpas ni en asumir responsabilidad alguna por sus declaraciones o por el problema de antisemitismo de su empresa. Sin embargo, ha encontrado tiempo para publicar más contenido vil en X.

Esto no es nada nuevo. Musk tiene un largo historial de declaraciones intolerantes o de apoyo a las declaraciones intolerantes de otros. Parece sentir una especial ira por George Soros, el financiero y filántropo húngaro que sobrevivió a la ocupación nazi en los años cuarenta. Soros se ha convertido en objeto de numerosas teorías de la conspiración ultraderechistas y antisemitas. Musk ha comparado a Soros con un supervillano judío y ha dicho que odia a la humanidad y ""quiere erosionar el tejido mismo de la civilización"".

Después de que el creador de ""Dilbert"", Scott Adams, despotricara racistamente diciendo que los negros estadounidenses eran un ""grupo de odio"" del que la gente debería ""alejarse de una j****a vez"", Musk lo defendió, tuiteando que los ""medios de comunicación son racistas"". Más tarde, añadió que aunque los comentarios de Adams ""no eran buenos"", expresaban un ""elemento de verdad"".

Ahí está esa palabra de Musk otra vez: ""verdad"". Nos está demostrando, una y otra vez, que lo que él cree que es verdad es profundamente feo, intolerante y falso. Deberíamos escuchar y comprender que el hombre más rico del mundo dice exactamente lo que quiere decir.","['insultante', 'que', 'elon', 'y', 'transaccional', 'musk', 'israel', 'el', 'opinión', 'la', 'del', 'una', 'en', 'fue', 'se', 'los', 'transparentemente', 'visita']","Los grupos judíos no tardaron en señalar que la declaración que Musk refrendó como ""la verdad real"" es en realidad una versión de una teoría de la conspiración racista.
